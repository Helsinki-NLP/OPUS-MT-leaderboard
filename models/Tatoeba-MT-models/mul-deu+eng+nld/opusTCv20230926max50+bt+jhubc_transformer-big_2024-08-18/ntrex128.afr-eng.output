Members of the House of Commons are concerned that they are going to "look like shit"
There is consternation among some members of the assembly over the proposal that their title should be changed from AM to MWP (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum are afraid that it could provoke a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wallis: In Wallies, twp means stupid and pwp means stool.
A member of the assembly of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "inconvenient" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or stupid.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Wallis Government Act 2017 gave the Wallis Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to name the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the AM, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in consultation with the public.
AM is apparently working on alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus could be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's working methods, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the drafting of the committee system.
AMs will get the last say in the question about what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an effort to clear out a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly capitulated its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's go silent because churches in Harlem are stupid
"Historically speaking, say the old people with whom I spoke, there was a pub and a church on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Not one of them is there anymore."
He says that the disappearance of crocodiles is understandable.
"People are socializing these days in other ways," he says.
"Croatia is no longer the neighborhoods of family rooms where people regularly go."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from property sales won't last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of types of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining refugee order.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring the day that these churches completely close even closer, because most of the people who enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white municipalities before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation withdrew in the 1930s.
A black church that worshiped nearby took over the title of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by His Excellency John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Honorable David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
Played at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church's playwrights, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the church's governing body, consisting of play leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "going to try to pass on the costs" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some church members complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark hurts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for cancer on the first day of the California crawl season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then moved closer with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he initially thought it was just the excitement of a first crustacean catch, but then he realized "that he was screaming, 'I was bitten!
I'm a bit of a bitch!"
His entire keybone was ripped open," Hammel saw when he came out with the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his bulge.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's say Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty salons that are staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, the larger beauty walks will be tested across 11 stores across the country and if it is a success next year will be taken to more stores.
The investment in beauty takes place as supermarkets search for ways to fill shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which for the first time will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers are insisting on.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second one that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a shift to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to their grocery sales, has strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument on how to divide the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its 281-store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commerce Director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially-trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brand names are designed to meet every need and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean that we are now an area beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away "angrily" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled her out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their homewear-and-accessibility trade name, Truly, not.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she had withdrawn her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing at the last minute from their lucrative lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when TV's golden girl on Tuesday at a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their after-sales, after-sales-and-wear.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and is said to have doubled Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she is leaving Truly, Jones climbed a radiator and traded Britain for one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truely was Holly's top priority at a distance.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to pull her out of the house was absolutely dumbfounded by all the people involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow Headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's most cash-inducing stars, could drive the firm out of the bag millions due to the sluggish investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clergy and household clothes, and the possibility that its launch could be delayed even more.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard words, "and then we fall in love."
He ridiculed criticism he was going to get from the news media for making a remark that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his chamber, "newsletter voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear weapons have been set ablaze.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, on Saturday, more than three months after the June leader's meeting in Singapore, told leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump has made a much more optimistic contribution to his congressional speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - it ended fire arrow tests, helped free hostages, and caused the rest of U.S. soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to describing relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have almost 200 people standing just there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Flooding and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is rooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is teaming up to travel to Palu, it's not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia continues to endure, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, it is not a common face to other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, albeit a warning of power.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's sprawling infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and spent considerable money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is plagued by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing the pressure of crushing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands of homeless people, such as Christian and Muslim gangs, have been fighting in the streets with snipers, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri indicated for Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He kicked the ball to the left before scoring far behind the goal.
The attempt hovered high above the window as it hovered to the upper right-hand corner of the net.
In the end, the ball bounced over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in the net case.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and type once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead of half time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper played back to Mateo Kovacic in that play area with a rear-facing header before scoring close to the midfield and innings in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and signalled in the midfield.
With a beautiful forward-looking goal, he then introduced Hazard to the window.
Hazard overtook the defense and ended up with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the far end goal.
Liverpool will play at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea arrives Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League for Videoton.
The death toll rises to 832 after the Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Numerous people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed on Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, causing burns of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was ravaged by the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything, to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I'm calling on anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything yesterday to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was informed by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are allowed in again.
It has been reported that a police officer for one man says that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, “It’s so bleak.”
At 2 nm there were two police wagons inside the cordon with another wagon just outside.
A number of officials have been left inside the cordon to monitor the block housing.
Anyone with information is asked to contact <0x40>MerPolCC to DM, 101, or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30 as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell Becomes Latest Remembrance Hit With 'Rewrite of History' Tweet
His banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "satisfaction" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statutes that Oliver Cromwell's shape outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagery of the English Civil War was still carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manipulative depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate depiction is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is established is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murdered Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his own, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery covered in blood near a cradle at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig's nest.
He said there was a large male squirrel in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and broken," the cousin, who was named "Wu," said, quoting the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 pm to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the marking authorities negotiated after alleged compensation for his death.
Although strange, there are cases of pigs that have been reported as attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"They're not playful.
They're pissed, very curious... they don't care to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico's north coast.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds from 85 m.p.u., a Category 1 hurricane, on Sunday from 5 p.m., and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific begins to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity north-west into the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching trough over the coming days will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous sewage spills, waste streams, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-to-place rainfall rates of from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Kits floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely foolish to venture into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep-flowing wildflowers to hit rivers and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a bit of local heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth running.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will leave Arizona on Sunday and begin early Monday before the rain will be more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, Talming summer heat will again try to rise and expand.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to begin hot October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the gripping testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christiane Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-fly turn: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had beta her drunk and tried to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartfelt testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen finds it sometimes difficult to meet people looking in offices.
To put it into perspective, it's an audience as large as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS Friday morning where protesters shouted at him when he tried to take a lifter to a Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes closed while CNN vividly depicting how he was being beaten.
"I'm standing right here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and entered the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting works all covered live hours later when the Judiciary Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate for next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK EM May accuses critics of 'political game' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accusing her of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is due to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should recover each other's tariffs was "completely offset."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the struggle.
Police recovered the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS-affiliated WAFB reports.
After they interrogated Simpson, the police said he admitted he shot Wayde dead.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish's judicial office issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for his "fighting and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "struck" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about," Wayne said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
As a result of the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital have reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after picking up activity in the crater and recording 183 releases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple rounds and shootings.
Images on social media showed how thin low-gas motor windscreens near Mexico City such as Xochimilco are covered.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists to commemorate independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing voice for founding.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police have smeared them with eggs and dumped powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually swarming with tourists.
A bakery also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their knuckles to keep the bakery in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No Forget, No Forgiveness" on one tone in confrontation with the Unionist's cry of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the raids, the local press reported.
The tension still runs high in the independence-minded region a year after the referendum on October 1 was deemed illegal by Madrid but is being celebrated by separatist-Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but participation was low, with those against the establishment largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the polling at the polling stations across the region from continuing in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful of the prospect that Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
"I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a life-threatening but sluggish victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exile or incarcerated from remand in custody on hold of referenda for their role in the organization.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tougher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsringel.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a stage after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Promoted Livigston surprised the Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved along with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed in the Premiership that season without a wedge and will come next week in front of the forerunners Heart, who are eight points ahead of them.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, is expanding their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not feeling a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston plays chances against bot visitors
Holt's team had to go ahead long before they scored a goal, with their round-tripness that brought Rangers all sorts of problems to their necks.
SR broke through, but turned in front of the goal yard, then AL could only play wide after he got closer and CH's head across the goal yard met.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could get the visitors with death game moments.
And that is how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers dropped a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga a chance to kick and score from the middle of the window.
At that point, the Rangers owned dominance but could not penetrate the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely careless.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a rematch of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was fired by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow stepped wide to avoid still open game of Livingston.
Oorcruises repeatedly reached Livingston's window and repeatedly reversed, while two penalties – after Halkett's challenge from replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball – were shown away.
‘Phenomenal’ by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic game and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations on this upward course.
Their playing style and crew have remained virtually unchanged since their return to first-class, but quite a bit of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was gigantic with his manic defense arrangement while Menga kept on their tones for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, which they find in the middle division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) there was a smile and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a breakdown on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan has come to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but numerous supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also voiced their voices and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting protests reflect the division of a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero and hailed by others as an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in collision with motorcycle
A cyclist died in a crash in London that involved a car.
The collision took place at about 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run staircase in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's crash took place.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his neighbors.
Road closures and bus routes are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Detainees Injured in Rebellion
Six custodians were injured in a riot at a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
Oproer broke out on Sunday around 09:30 BST and is still on the run at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Keepers" have been called in to deal with the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to pay attention to a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars for longer."
HMP Long Martin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief officer of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, disgruntled officials were called to pay attention to serious disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink Three Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfluid (Dry Areas Trek Possibly Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona but that's exactly what could happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's residual energy moves across the southwestern desert and carries seismic flux risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued kite flood wakes for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and late Monday will be approaching with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of flooding, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path to approaching land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still facing hurricane-force Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm hits cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore decreases its power.
It is therefore expected to reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening against tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a significant flood risk.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening wetlands and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage sons of a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found Saturday at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered among the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's merciless and shocking tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered under the public, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh on Thursday testified before Congress and fiercely and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans had seen Kavanaugh's "brilliance and quality and courage" that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent legal spirits of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for these candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader's cadence officer told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesian shelling, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday in the city of Palu on the beach for a beach party when firefighters of up to six meters (18 feet) high broke off at night on the beach, washed away many after their deaths and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately race and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said in a statement.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, steamers, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to free the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops that have been destroyed, bridges that have been devastated and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, Nassau shook the coastline.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant shelling was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunamis, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake.
Communication is "completely obstructed with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get a lot worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami struck Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, it is possible to hear a man on the top floor of a building desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami screaming to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and drags buildings and cars along.
Reuters couldn't immediately declare the image eg.
The shooting and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport is only reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-Suenami death tolls rose over 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city where workers sheltered in deck shelters erected in their office’s courtyard, they perished on the way at scenes of destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups begin the gruesome task of launching the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, stocks and personnel from overseas can only get started after the area from the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we can open it for international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was picked up from a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian national parachute weaving team, finished two of the missing parachute weavings for the Asian Games that ran in Indonesia earlier this month.
Another of those who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the paratrooper weaving field, I read my own emotional stuff," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media among the parachuting community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who took part in the beach parties.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray regs tag, instead of two blue regs.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Diewe steel $26,750 during refill of OTM by Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car was in the process of emptying an OTM in an amusement complex and preparing to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came down from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West to change his name to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new Yandhi all.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the show that canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
Aside from the fact that this is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'you' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also come along with or without a couplet sign and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to never use military power against civilians in the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to fight the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements across Latin America postulated.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attract young people to bands.
The U.S. needs to double its funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even recently the U.S. has an overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year, China announced their plan: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI performance will be achieved in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated U.S. Othello player and later was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has given recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate ones," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help to help the US' AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically presented to PhDs in AI," he said.
In July 2017, China's Council of State issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the Withuis announced the formation of a Committee of Expertise on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire months ago.
Macedonians vote in elections or should the country's name be changed
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", actions that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bans for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the rise will meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the result of the vote to decide on it.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of incompetence at 1 nm.
But the rise was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's E.M. Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small raise and drew up chairs for tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he gave his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates all over Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received an indication at the beginning of the series at the midfield.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero is surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed by a defender before he passed several others on the edge of the Brighton goalkeeper.
He then threw a pointer to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're happy that he's set a goal at that point."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the farthest point.
The Sky Blues' predictor kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the back line.
City tackle Hoffenheim in Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
He wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to start the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have scored at least one promotional spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to tie their first division title.
"Although we're not playing for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level from any point of I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favourable to have Scherzer thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a throwing exercise on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 draws in 220 2/3 laps this season.
Trump to hold meetings in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing and that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for these candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awkward, awkward radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back power by using any possible way, one sees the community, the amusement.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and common and fun and false."
He referred to the name of the Senate Judiciary Committee's top-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received loud cries from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you leave the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one -- it was really poor body language -- the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' Party is no longer a broad church.
It's intolerable to those who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I’m the last person in a string of Labour LPs who’s been told we’re not welcome — all because we’ve said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because she has stood up in a fearless way against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues about which Jeremy differed from previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, that was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "more friendly, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Workers' Party and each opinion is judged based on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never otherwise agree with – whether it was national security or the EU.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a tirade of scathing on social media asking me not to be re-elected, rejecting politics from the core and telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Workers’ Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the remarks that are directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never get away with it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of abuse have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "movement of infidelity" or change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced and that I would then be "okay."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, driven by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally dropped out of my state high school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local government minister or councillor.
I've never lost my mind, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my policy positions and areas where I differed from the current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending on a Brexit that will hurt all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether their members of the Workers' Party are or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from not being re-elected or politically will be of any benefit to me as long as I'm reluctant to do so.
Chris Leslie is an LP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Surrender Ayr bo
Two late three may have skewed the final score a bit, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennet's Premiership match of the day.
They are now on top of the punctuation, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chance shots, which carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested so far in our games and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, targeted by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to dribble on and count the numbers.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty kick, just before he, just before rest time, scored a solo triple to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, beaten by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruairidh Knott which was carried on a portable, and from the restart Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, sued by Climo.
Ayr's observing captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again, Melrose used the extra player with an unintentional three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very busy game.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for catching Climo without the ball, and from the penalty shootout, MacPherson squeezed the ball behind the upcoming Ayr draw.
Climo intended it, as he had almost done it from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal and sent Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star seems to be moving to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he has been appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, though a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's land-circuited hope court will reopen to the Pacific
Matrose patrols a masquerade-covered naval barracks in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying a blue flag.
Fleet basins from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are coated with the slogan: "The sea is rightly ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country surrounding Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict to Chile is still fresh – beyond the need to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1, after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial re-election battle next year – also has much to do with Monday’s ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favour – and that little will change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to recognize Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last statement shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric taped any remaining Chilean benevolence, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be incredibly difficult to conduct Naval talks.
The two countries exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extremely fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will "bring an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crook.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea Says Nuclear Weapons Won't Come Unless They Can Trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the competing countries.
His remarks follow U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. hijacking to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second round of talks.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about distancing itself from an arsenal that the country sees as the only way to ensure their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveals Newest Series of Big Head Covers On The Road To The Shops Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn the sun off, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of law oversized headlines at their SS19 collection on the treadmill that enchanted the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have traversed Instagram this summer and these designers have paraded their astounding creations on the treadmill.
The glider by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide rim that engulfed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories include water lemons decorated with jewels, a magic hat, and even a pineapple – but it’s not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had elaborate lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and diving goggles included, while another looked like a melted cream ice cream bun.
And if you continue the great fashion show, it's your happy day.
Stylish viewers predict that the huge hat may be on its way to the shops near you.
The oversized hats follow briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the two-foot wide rim straw hat seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread across social media sent another big creation across the treadmill – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the swimsuit-dressed model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia cuts and finished with a white leather handle at the top, featured at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags appear in stores next summer - as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized extras."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zip performance of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with yet another set of excellent exam scores, which have just been reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a newly created school curriculum, we see that world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam scores, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a higher A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher degree A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as professional, have the same importance as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Professions and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons that employees provide why they struggle to fill jobs, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically place a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in today's children's language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are deemed essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
At this stage, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still tremendously important for the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
True, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see how LeBron James makes his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in San Diego in Sunday's pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets.
The exact number of minutes he's going to play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the pre-season program.
"At this point in my career, I don't need pre-season games to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a general election in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently withheld for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm election because Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when it is voted on in November.
How late is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can check out Trump's contract in West Virginia via live streaming below.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's interrogation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week while the FBI is setting up an investigation.
But the main point of this overcrowding is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign said that these five gatherings in the coming week were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to name him, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind, according to the voter.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the ballot box," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryderbeker 2018: The U.S. team shows they have the courage for the fight to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-game team was probably just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an all-new sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we're carrying it as a bit of momentum, I reckon," Jordan Spieth said when he ran away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more that are being played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the clean field and led by his example.
Those scoring celebrations became harder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set-up to win match four completely equal while he and Thomas were behind after two rounds with two.
His setup that won the game at 15 for them was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to get everything out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all the players are talking about now.
18 holes to print their stamps.
The only players to score more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undoubted story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's rare but horrendous couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't keep one on Saturday afternoon on track, but they also kept one on Saturday morning on track avoided as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy apparently flows to and from these outlandish crowds, confirms that they are the players who need to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player like Fleetwood or Molinari who can climb a potential European victory when the sun hits Le Golf National.
Either at the same time or at different wells.
It's still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short-lived matches with Sergio Garcia, the morning's quarter-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One held on to job numbers and two doubles on the front nine made the Spaniard and the Swede land in a hole from which they could hardly even come.
There's no one out there to help you on Sunday.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to keep a close eye on due to the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team and took the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session also showed that the US team has the courage to fight that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming up with a 10-6 lead from Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score asleep at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which tries to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's four-balls, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four-games and won two games, but they didn't let the backlash shrink.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, after a sensational weekend called "Moliwood," are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to beat a pop Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who calmed down during the morning's four-balls, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third on the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a little wind south-west of Paris, Europe did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth, who won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas, on Saturday set the mark for the Americans with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-game after losing the first two wells.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point draw when they entered the singles game, although Furyk's team only had to play uniformly to keep the trophy because they already held it.
After being second best for two days, however, it doesn't seem like they'll be able to cope with a teen attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will "definitely not" unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions worsen their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such traits.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant charitable measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to dismantle nuclear weapons.
"We don't see any similar reaction from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will certainly not disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons that would be rewarded if North Korea took step-by-step steps, his words seemed meaningful because it did not have the unilateral removal of nuclear weapons.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons" that Trump has pledged to do in Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted requests to ease stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'destroying nuclear weapons first' and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling manner, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our infidelity."
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader drew attention to earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue of nuclear weapons destruction were not pounding South Korea and did not sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
The tone of Ri's speech, however, was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fire arrows would be directed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Bad President" Trump gave Kim a "fireman" shot.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim abundantly for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still need to remain there until North Korea is devastated.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for this, saying "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and without ceasing until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to dry up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the weekends of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "beneficial demands" just hours later.
North Korea has pledged in a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile persole and also to take a nuclear complex if the United States "compliant measures."
He said Kim told him that the "compliant measures" he wants to see are security guarantees that Trump has promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough russians
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all its undergraduate students get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by coffee-driven 'full-night sessions'.
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often unfamiliar when it comes to the basic principles of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep intake on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said no one has ever told her how important sleep is - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to enter the course after it was found that students were seriously asleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, workout shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deprivation and the importance of a dormant.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep exposure can increase the risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the student's behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'study all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep intake is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid it to put on weight, because sleep perception hangs the brain in a starving mode, putting your whole tyre up.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he ran one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to invite him for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can sway your rhythm and disrupt your circadian rhythms.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal wins Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarcasm away when Dolly Menga's goalkeeper Steven Gerrard's unfortunate team suffered a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a driver so his team was eight points behind Hearts, which led to a loss in the Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before rest time, and it didn't look like a Rangers team would play the same without much inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object apparently was thrown off the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his nooks with the way his well-trained team smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They had to score points after only two minutes when Menga's first deposit Scott Pittman passed on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened up his great chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensemate Alan Lithgow could only miss shot at the rear goalpost.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to score a penalty at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was disheartened by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a make-up goalie from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
The Rangers did not once again deal with a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his streak to the block.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett hitting the ball long after the long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to turn Jacobs before Lithgow could widen out from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had yet another late claim for a penalty when he met Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the violin
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TALK MORE... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger Teller.
Since then, the Violinist has been a supportive pillar of science, and it has also become a supportive pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "This is a guitar counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones off, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
He said, "Okay, that's about it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer drug can teach the immune system to 'see' rover cells
New cancer drug can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill rover cells
Detox teaches the immune system to identify rover cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to identify rover cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of various types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump mockery after his performance on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was staged during a Saturday Night Live at the studio after a lengthy performance in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would make him eligible in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he stepped out against the Democrats and reiterated his support of Trump.
"I talk to a white man so often and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'"
"Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been broadcast, the footage of West's hit was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's unclear if Rock for West has been trying to spot by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him behind the raise over what he was wearing on his head.
"They put me behind the wheel.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They've spoiled me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would wear his "super coat, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try out the love."
His comment triggered at least twice an outcry to the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who told the publication: "The whole studio has become deadlocked."
West was introduced as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the space clerk Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of TPUSA's conservation group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE SKARE."
But chat show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply "was who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen to NEVER reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe accepts and preaches an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He is free.
"We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme chatterer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he is now "the creature that was known before as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday with a knife.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Appeals on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-waving role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often mean that young boys feel they need to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his roommate from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt "reasonably strong" about making work of this issue.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did our men learn as they grew up regarding the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is quite possibly responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something seems to have gone wrong with our young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer because he says he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a rover.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that's how it gave me my future family, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which represents a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who committed HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemning 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday issued a plea alleging that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats have claimed that the allegations are driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more pernicious lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the postings is related to Waters's office and has disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of this deceptive and false claim - was not responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including former Withuis press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she doesn't have the temperament of being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
Don't question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who has been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to illuminate Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are brought to justice," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spy Pottery
It's now traditional to look for Brexit significance in any new film with a British accent and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spotter franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-choice self-satisfied on the subject of how eye-opening power we are be the nation's new execution opportunity?
In any case, the helpless Johnny English with his outbursts and rubber faces had his license to redo everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking cast audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculed secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretentiousness to sophisticated elegance, had a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean, and a good shot of that old man who contributed a single note to the 2012 Chariots of Fire-emalid spells at the Opening Pleasure.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, which leaves chaos behind him, which Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two wonderful moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English who ran into a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval pantser suit and the screw blades briefly hooded against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels rather fuzzy and peculiarly redundant, especially when the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy itself with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson's styling jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the agent's dismay in service - a sad little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is an inflated and besieged character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this Kwasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is in jeopardy, she must summon someone from his resignation.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at some deft institution, but who gives off the record lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, once again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamapstist role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are about to completely waste everything in Her Majesty's secret service completely back to service and come down to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculing escapades: disguised as waiters set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's snail hunt; and English lets pure anarchy unravel when he tries to use a header for virtual reality Full of se...
For that last scene nothing is saved, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is pretty much like children's TV.
Quite moderately.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come true?
Work denies that it is a plan for Brittes to work a four-day job but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Workers' Party needs to consider a drastic plan that will cause Britte to work a four-day job - but pay for five days.
The party wants to claim that corporate savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution should be passed on to workers by giving them an extra day.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take home the same payment.
Sources say it will "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in favor of the workers.
Changing after a four-day period has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a Thursday working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this ambition is currently not endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A Thursday working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "switched directors" and "winners" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a Labour government could make "deductions" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on boards of companies and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector enterprises to employees, who can get annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh may change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and above the question whether the bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican Senses asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could deepen anything that could make them change their opinion.
Kennedy looked more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do this?
He was determined, certainly, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unchanging.
"I formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an indictment of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett boldly denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who called her couldn't confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the World Burger Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that features a particularly impressive group of stars that performs and has an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year and during the celebration, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the opportunity's true purpose to address extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Burger Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Immunity Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing volunteer work, sending an email to a world leader in order to make a phone call or pay phone calls.
But how successful was the World Citizen at the age of 12 who remained to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or spinning a tweet?
Since 2011, World Burger says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a host of different goals.
It says these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential," and vowing to give $35 million to Rwandans more than seven years ago to help end malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman said during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional restrictions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website asking "what makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
"It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Fleet for "Blockade" to Reverse Russian Energy Exports - Interior Minister
"If necessary" Washington can leave him on its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers themselves the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that it is practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to give exports of their liquefied natural gas to Europe a boost to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoners."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked a counter-reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" her position as president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" standing as president after the midterm elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our fragmented government and that includes a woman at the top of the sport," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren echoed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before our vote."
A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand by 2020.
Eighty-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator did not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to be possible in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son has been going through, what he has been going on since he came back, I have sympathy for other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injury our soldiers are returning with," she told an audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in departure" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault on a woman, meddling with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court lawsuit in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent gang boys," abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court order said.
Prosecutors further argued in the lawsuit that the policy that immigrants refuse access harms the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their country of birth due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – faced by people around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll double in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly puzzling.
"It feels very tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she comforts her frantic baby boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute you bring an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen where they return to their destroyed homes, searching for inundated possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-size shooting, were overcrowded.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's military hospital where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
Trane fills his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Abusing' with 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper appreciating the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid insert in the Des Moines Register — the state's most-selling newspaper — after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election, noted what U.S. officials told Reuters, is a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war that has led to their tariff margins matching each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at beating exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now exacerbates the deterrence by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Contrary to that, one will find very limited divergent voices at the newsstand in the street here in Beijing and not see any true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people have expressed about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he said.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has scrapped away from offering to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republican ousted women voters for midterm elections with Kavanaugh-debakel, warn analysts
While many top Republicans stand at Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh and defend himself in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
Emotions about this are running tremendously high, and most Republicans are on record already indicating they want to proceed with the vote.
Those things can't be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s call for an FBI investigation on the nipple would be enough to quell bad voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is on the way!" as they protested in the Senate's entrance portal while the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Misey's testimony.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among swastika-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which outlined the details of her alleged sexual assault against the Supreme Court-nominated, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"This has become a door-to-door mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it's also about the way Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents decided whether or not they likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 said they decided or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitively hooked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's impeachment, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nominated uncovered his gender to her while attending a party during their student life at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to end Google and Facebook's struggle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a startup that seeks to engage with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open-source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea with Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do this," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional utilities.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What's unique about personal online data storage is that it's entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and applicable skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change, where all of their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victorian Crusade-spiritual celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol Honourable Bernard Vann acquired the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbols" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "by a lot of dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later chased him to the line of fire and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before storming a man-only field rifle and knocking three out of the section.
Lt.kol Vann was killed on 4 October 1918 by a German sniper – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never confess, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orcs.
Michael Vann said he "feel honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a bunch of people."
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine yourself, you stay up all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just so you can't watch the main event.
San Jose's program included 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to end the fight, viewers in the UK were dumbfounded when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "someone sick joke."
"It's government regulation that the content around 6 nm was not appropriate and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the retransmission, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of texts that were sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried to offer more to our fans and just go over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has a "underrated" feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school before realizing that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he enjoyed his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that to become a parent, he didn't care much about winning at the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, quit for a few months due to illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling differently, the true things that gave me the strength and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he enjoyed his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion has said that falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "captured him on the sidelines."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference was never an issue.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last good things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and it was dead that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that's what I've been dreaming about all my life - to dive in front of my home team at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song collection – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't run and withdraws to Saturday's Ryderbeker
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get his shape to make sure it's an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for a record 12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's quarter-ball and quarter-finals.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major-winner will divide his day between being a race leader and working on the practice bench on his game in the hopes of fixing the gap.
Even at the height of his career he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long rugby always punishes the staggering hue.
And as if the track on its own isn't challenging enough, Mickelson comes to stand in his ninth game Sunday against accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game could be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed her confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a punch on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Heroes Hall and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I put more in the foreground, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the player who played the most Riderbeker games on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wickets, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to shave the crazy, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving crazy with him, which was fun to see.
He's got so much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major lead could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead over the last day's singles game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nail scrap with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the nails," Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching Golf at 10 and National before the Class of 2018 Friday 5th.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the dots on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I'm still saying all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are in our team, but we're also well aware of who's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Excited about how her players have been at risk on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never make any progress with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes to the turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, put the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must put the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk would like his players to sail better individually than they did as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of that great last day, where he was part of the desire team at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every obscure word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, bravely spoke to his players on his way to that last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen there at Brookline, as seen there at Medinah.
When that momentum starts in one direction, it puts a lot of tension on that middle game.
We set up our team accordingly and shared the men that we felt, you know, would bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the teen attack and coming into the main match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said of his single-game choices.
Germany's new warship has been postponed.
The German military's latest frigate would have been deployed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, local media reported.
The deployment of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit newspaper, quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battalion of air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from homeowners.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships – which will apparently allow Germany to project power overseas – will already be outdated by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate struck last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" will render the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also come to light that the ship is drastically overweight, which reduces work performance and reduces the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also touched on a problem.
It apparently reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems encountered by the new frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that the power of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Fleet's "ships that can be deployed are in the process of becoming operational."
The official said the issue worsened over time, as old ships were put out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Fleet.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Vlermuis
New research is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how butterflies use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano butterfly mice as well as the brown long-tailed and Daubenton butterfly mice at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations on the property to track batting activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile surveys using hand-held indicators.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will check the frequency of the bats and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how to best manage forests for bats and other associated species.
Flemish populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects sleeping place and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flying paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by cats.
Vlermuis is not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting prey.
They use a sophisticated egg-orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do surveys and sleepplace inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated butterfly reserve at Thrave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten butterfly species.
The real estate manager David Thompson said the property is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Thraave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there's so much about bats that's still unknown, that's why the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasized the necessity of seeking for butterflies for maintenance in properties being done because it is possible that the unknowing destruction of a single cradle could result in the death of up to 400 females and small children and could eradicate an entire local population.
Fleas are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations sail."
Ronaldo quits rape allegations as prosecutors prepare to sue German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo ended rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus predictor is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375 000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he spoke to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
"What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
"I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they, according to Reuters, called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy."
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good old man" who was left in the spot by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an arrangement outside the courthouse because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was about to join Manchester United at Real Madrid and this summer, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal, moved to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'forever regret' if their car manufacturers lose
The UK will "remorse it forever" if they lose their status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will have to temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK motor manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that added costs in the long term could reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite's co-founder at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, Withuis said.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed by another week" as the bakery over nominees for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the Withuis said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and possible cross-examination of the law by the president.
Whether or not Trump will resign from the deputy attorney general and threaten Mueller's independence has been firing Washington's hideous stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the Withuis, amid reports that he was on his way to thank him.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump further postponed a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that has not yet been determined, it could be this week, I can see that it is postponed by another week with all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a Withuis press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said the rarity to information sessions is not due to a reluctance for TV journalists who are "effect-beating," although she said: "I won't argue with the fact that they're effect-beating."
She said that there will be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen it do a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the Withuis or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and timely, bizarre appearance for journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to demonstrate the country's gratitude and express the wish that they will remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed themselves to cover costs of negotiated status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter to me. Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat how much I put each staff member's contribution on the prize, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities that serve us.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he sustained a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State Chief Executive Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had taken place shortly before the break.
"He came to the sidelines and sort of stuck in there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before it was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no details yet about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was at Tennessee State in his first season after moving out of Illinois.
He scored five kills on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total standings for the season to 18 kills.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that the government's plans will help to combat homelessness.
The surcharge – which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens that push up prices and make it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spook villages" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by raising land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to refrain from quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "residential disaster."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no-fault dismissals".
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
That's why we want to restore our broken home.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life.
But it can't be right that it's as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK as it is for overseas-based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become a reality too great."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's driver at some point.
The Scott, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East team, which is currently in third place in Liga One, three points below the tops.
He moved to the Stadium of Lights this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child, I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and that's something that drew me back.
I can only do that if I'm successful with the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland driver include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he has no fear of following up on such established names at such a large club, having previously shown off offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself a success if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is only three years away, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the margin of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he says as he recalls how he took over Alloa's silos.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but managing just feels right.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it, it feels the most comfortable I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain's succumbing pubs' income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and pub groups saw sales increase by 2.7% in July – but restaurant revenues were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Predicted sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as last month, June, when drinking was at percent places with 2.8 restaurants.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drink-driven drinking places and pubs fared better and more up than restaurants had gone down.
Food-guided drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not so much as restaurant operators
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
Reguor-managed pubs and drinking places increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food was down by three percent."
Paul Newman, from relaxation and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly difficult above and apart from ongoing uncost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring the necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across pubs and restaurants, including new venues that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand announcements.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey reveals
A survey of 20,000 high school teachers revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of learners say they have a "main account" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of learners said they have a clean "main account" to show for parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who came down to her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who urged others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers come in the temptation to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Championships
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the Board's annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, unable to walk after having a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors have just said the time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it fully recovered, again learned how to walk and do aptitude exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising that compares moms to cows divides opinions online
A breast pump company has shared reviews online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
In celebration of the launch of what is called the "world's first silently portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspired ad to show the freedom that the pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straws and cows to the tune of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a stern" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not onions, it's my breasts."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the ad that was published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from viewers, with many saying it played down the "gruwels" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
After we have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump does not discreetly in a nutrition bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Descriptively traumatic for mom and baby.
But, yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "The ad is so out of emotion."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screamingly" for her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow's milk.
The ad is a bit of a trick, but I've accepted it for what it is.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Someone else remarked: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who are breastfeeding (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like 'cow'.
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead silent, has no wires or tubes and only discreetly in a nutrition bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother remarked: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and compelling introduction.
By drawing a parallel between women who are breastfeeding and dairy cows, we wanted to put the breastfeeding process and all its challenges into the spotlight, while in an entertaining way that people can find connection demonstrates the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time that the Elves have heard the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the treadmill for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border agencies have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the sharp rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that make it harder to put children on bail.
Traditionally, most bailiffs were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by taking steps forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential burglars and other adult members of their households would have to give their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to secure unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either burglars or family members of burglars are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials have put in place new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconferencing call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily overlooked due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "tax authorities" to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "decently handled."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more unrooted, is "almost over."
He said Damascus will continue "to carry out this sacred battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that motivate refugees to stay away."
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these repatriations," he said.
"They're politicizing something that just needs to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no rebuilding aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel settlement created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement repelled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "extinct."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem has prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "negotiating the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberals likely hope, a state of indictment and scandal ends his presidency early.
In what undoubtedly "will be the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
To date, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of cable viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional Building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he lets me laugh,' "he told me. Scovell told me.
There is amusement in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Exiting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's shoes from the full-straight-fly jacket.
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he's feeding you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role-playing and daily kinks in the plot.
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't take him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scale.
"I remember when we were doing all that time programs and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but now it seems they were right."

Out-of-pocket flow after the most exciting mid-term election race in the House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a shift of congressional districts that has now made two officials enter a race around the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district lets Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure powers.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
The maps were revoked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally deposed in Republican favor.
The race in the new 17th ended with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail-scratch win in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. has considered penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but has since returned.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners postponed the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, earlier this month.
But fines have only been considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials deferred a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was deemed a step forward by the United States in an attempt to immigrate.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American singers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new bad messages or straws from Washington.
A Withuis spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen could be the special discussion about Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible cross-examination of the court, of which there is now a lot of significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus on his investigation of whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia cooperated in the country's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, only when he is preparing to go back to the electorate, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
This is a bunch of aces, and with that, I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – and neither is that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, when the West only resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the merciless course of democracy is hampered or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points in the face.
What will we do if Mr. Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, thanks you?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to covertly record the president and speculated about whether he was competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we keep track of those tests, there's a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government who lived in my embassy at one time.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

The Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimism for Rapid Vienna match
Rangers will play host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equaliser result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 equaliser result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and got away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a tiebreaker is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another great European day.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowds on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there is a well-being factor in place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully we will be able to get through the past season and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Retirement Savings Fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't pronounce your wishes long in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor in: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your financing decisions for long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own resources – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut right-handed at the fit.
Get a health care attorney in place so that you appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
You also need to consider your finances.
You have to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so that you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues we're talking about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with wind pants
A man was shot several times with a windbreaker when he walked into the house after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, emergency officials were unable to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-size shooting.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was busy celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck them.
Donggala is a rainforest that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A Tsoenami also struck West Donggala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake along the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shellings struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-environment struck the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, leading to a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A level shooting struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, leading to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shooting and tsunami in 2004.
This time it didn't lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major shocks hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he picked up a female acquaintance's phone at her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-Trial facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured security deposit, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certainly" when asked what he was advocating, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and be fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time there have been criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
This is the case for Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed to have stabbed him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his duty in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Suenami: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused the deaths of eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to cut off pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the announcement of intent to ask for the death penalty, filed in the New South District.
Both of these charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in favor of blackmail, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "deep planning and precaution," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as "disgusting, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after they were convicted of a conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were corrected with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after he watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept a shoulder sentence to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked persecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says Nigel Farage should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage took an oath today to mobilize "the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the heat” from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own LPs suggested he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Ms May faces to unite her deeply divided officers has been challenged by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would push through in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of the deadlock - and Eurosceptics and Labour forced to choose between her package and "chaos."
Mr Bone told the Loop Meaning Loop meeting in Solihull that he "wanted to throw out checkers".
He proposed that Mr Farage be made a nobleman and be given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in control, we would have been out by then," he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers."
He expressed his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be subject.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone showed suggestions of the hand that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure we are elected in the first place.
"Please let the checkers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Ms May, she added: "Prime Ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farge said the congressional politicians had to feel the "hot" if they were on the threshold to want to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let you get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to feel the heat of our political class, who is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in the downtown area.
Some activists have waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour politician Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application like the conference opened.
"It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a smart overall.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘look hard’ to stand for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "hardly look to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's already in the middle of speculation that she may be challenging Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump's rule.
A resident asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman very high."
Arrested in shooting murder of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, on Saturday announced that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was finally killed as a result," Murphy J. Paul, the chief of police, told the media on 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, was in possession of a weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 forwards last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team recommends him win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team recommendations would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first got into the pits and let Hamilton ride very far back into the traffic convoy, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes pushed a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-on-wheel action which left the Ferrari driver resentful risk-free seeing the inside at risk of endurance after a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the road jumping grid and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held on to his tyres to quickly get ready and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually got into the 44th round at the pits, but could not accelerate her just in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having a one-two," Hamilton said.
It's been a very bad language
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not address directly the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and unobsessed" and lied.
"The one thing that can happen and the cute thing that's happened over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get it?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a little bit.
We leaked it...No, we didn't leak it," he added, in a presentation by the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that explained the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not like her denial and commented during Saturday night's convention: "I'm telling you what. It was very bad language.
She may not have, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominees accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to withdraw with any necessary means.
"You see the community, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to outrun to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars conceded for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee to a close before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied for victory.
This was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost games and when Friday Dundee won 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth rally of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford scoring the assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening season, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the keeper for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break in when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again got their equaliser with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of people on planes can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people was safely boarded.
More than 800 people have died and more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many have been caught in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that severely swung at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immobile to ensure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to safely board.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he daydreamed in it.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster warning agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still rising as many bodies are still under the boulevards while many cannot yet be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters, Palu roared that will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-market is being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I always ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after beach sea plane crash
The airline, which handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia, said one man was missing after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed near the runway in the coastal sea.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had skipped the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had entered very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendant was panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said ships that worked close to improving a cage also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to get people back and forth before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts set a timeline apart from the night a woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which was inconsistent with her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's lockdown that night, Sanford said he was "joking because my lockdown was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Self-records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said a moment after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He saved her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its lockdown on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the hearing to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
It's a black person?!
New York City's children's daycare couple for missing out on "racist" text
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrongly addressed message from the mother who complained that she was "an overnight black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the case to "persecution."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was upset when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEE NOG A SWART PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to me twice.
After she found out about her mistake, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice and said that they were outgoing child-girls who were African-Americans, did bad work and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work one day and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple for damages over the compensation and seeks his compensation up to $350 per day for the six months, residential works for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing that well," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple retaliated on claims that they were racist and said it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it had been out of abuse?
"Your newborn baby?"
Come on, now."
Plasco compared the case to "persecution" and said his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're just going to put a person behind you?"
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit was still going on, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple to social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very exciting that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "bittersoet" last year.
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-gay man," she said.
"But because Paddington was eg for him, it was almost as if one had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
"Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was terribly bad, that they didn't expect her to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I get the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say hello to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before she died and the body was about to close.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was like unfolding.
I couldn't remember or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to do it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was injured at the time for the loss of her daughter, went on the plane along with the other passengers on board - unaware of the trial, appreciated she went.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had my head shaved and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's Post Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Wallis bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want a parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
"They always said that her smile had made a difference."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Mr. Davis designed the maps, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said her death had been very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It's tearing a hole through the family.
This breaks us apart.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that didn't have any cuts - we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under party suspension.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to set up an FBI investigation?
It's all because of their time constraints.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans sail badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the House of Commons and who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the report?
There will be a ballot in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a match and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea Warrior Counts 'Down' Under Kim
The number of North Korean fighters to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South's unification cabinet, saying there were 1,127 overruns last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of warriors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fly via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the High Protection Demilitarized Zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China considers the warriors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have dramatically improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the strike negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they broadly agreed to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday slapped U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histories", says he is incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh "histories" and said he was temperamentally incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say 'hysteries'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at the time he almost screamed and sneezed as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him "a ridiculous and coordinated character homicide," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I will say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not competent to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the court he's currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Ommegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act of Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger boiling over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying because I was going to tell the person I was talking to," she said.
I'm angry."
And then she just walked in.
"I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial output for thumb because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and grabbed at my neck by an older woman - a cold driver for whom I was a little scared - who shoved me in a staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they've had an impact on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the reins, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think very well about the decision," she told me lying 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
It's called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with fundraisers and so she made a vow that she would not enter the recess unless she raised $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she would only give $250.
"Do you think I'm going to get it?" she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates - for sexism.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate borg.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening avenue of the trade war between the US and China had been overwhelming and, while the fight is nearing its end, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by charging major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week ensued with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) of items and effectively charging half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has taken back goods each time and has recently hit tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 trillion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equalize the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move anytime soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means handing over requests, but to meet U.S. requests in public would be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on U.S. trade war over the long term can positively support China by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could start an economic tow flight in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than spectators have ever confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the coastal country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA won with a final point of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, shot his T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole and awarded his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari blinked in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest ranking, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's all-time European winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so thankful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I was able to help," an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The unbelievable pride I feel, to win Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at it that way," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has already lost four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 great titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we set a little heat on Europe.
We've screwed up.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat dirty.
We're overreacting."
