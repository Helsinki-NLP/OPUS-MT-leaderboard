Who told you I did this?
It's never too late.

Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I didn’t get an answer, I wrote to her again.
What would you like to say about this?
You think it's a trap?
Guys, stop killing each other.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do that.
I borrowed a car from Tom.

Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of commission.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I was trying to fall asleep.
Tom is always on the net.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
Somewhere in this building.
We are open tomorrow.
I did not expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a beer bottle.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There must be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the blankets?
Have you been to Washington, D.C.?

What was not enough!
Tom said that Mary was probably still doing the same thing.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss told me to leave earlier today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
How cute!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's going to be pretty cold tonight.
I'm not asking Tom for help.
How much you paid to do it.

I know you're here.
Now half to the third.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no great hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost all of us.
You need to be at home until 2:30.
Are you going to school on foot?
Is that Tom's girl?
Tom is wasting his time.
The molecule is made up of atoms.
We are aware of this.

I have a headache.
Please repeat it again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.

Nice weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.

Where's Dad?
Who else helped you?
I would be happy to help you.
Are you over 18?
The dog is trying to escape.
Tom can't read.

Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucy called yet?
Looks like Tom.
You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.

I'm waiting for your help.
Don't touch this blue button.
Did Tom get in touch with you?
"This guy, he's such a catcher," Mary said.
He once loved her.
He likes football.
Birthdays are important.
Here's your key.
You don't like swimming?
What time can you come?
Tom says he expects Mary to do it.
Throw Tom the ball.
Tom is trying to figure out what to do with him.
Is that positive news?
We're not very hungry yet.
You see the boat, Tom?
Tom doesn’t do everything in his power.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're skinny.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Maybe this world is another planet’s hell.
He grabbed the butterfly, squeezing it between his big and pointed fingers.
This cookie is delicious.
Women are so strange!
I have already considered this idea.
Tom hit me on the head.
Am I bothering you?
I know how to ski.
Do what they tell you.
I'm looking for you.
Some didn’t want to fight.
You know why Tom doesn't drink?
His book inspired me.
I don't think Tom will come back.
I measured the hat.
Tom is getting old fast.
Tom said I had a terrible look.
I had a bit of a fight with Tom.
"When will you come back?" "It all depends on the weather"
Am I a holomosa?
It's a Scottish name.
Is there a hot dog sandwich?
Thank you for yesterday.
Can’t you see that Tom needs your help?
I'm not a soldier.
Tom's wife told me he wasn't home.
I bought Tom a watch.
I didn't say anything.
Don't beat me.
Tom usually wears a tie to work.
The person who helped me was Tom.
I'm going outside.
The dog's name is Ken.
I was fair.
When did I say the wrong thing?
I think Tom is a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I love to draw maps.
He's shulga.
What is a computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing yourself?
What are you doing?
Tom decided to do it.
Your medications are ready.
I thought you were interested.
Everyone has their own, right?
I was so excited that I couldn’t sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
I recently changed my job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was saddened.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Do I seem to be nervous?
The girl we saw when she was waiting for someone near Tom’s house was Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I put too much sugar in it.
Do you know how to skate?
I know how to do it.
Is Tom still alive?
I don’t have to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
I baked Tom's cake.
She can ask questions and answer them.
He said he had an alibi.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What is Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn’t think Mary would want to do that.

I have a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a team member.
I had a stroke last year.
My mom is busy preparing dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Come back sooner.
He's incompetent.
Thomas was training.
He is unbearable.
I am sure he will take the exam.
Tom voted in favour of the proposal.
Did Tom tell you how long it took him to do this?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm totally exhausted.
The prospects are not very bright.
I don’t believe in anything supernatural, but I am fascinated by the literary character of the devil.
The trouble is that she doesn’t have enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom will actually go to Mary's concert.
Did Tom say he spent last weekend with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught me how to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father to be buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn’t cry.
I'm DJ.
I HATE Christmas.
Was the money enough?
I found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
The child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You have to learn to be restrained.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true for Japan.
We will lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
He's talking.
The surface of the balloon is non-euclideal space, so it does not follow the rules of Euclidean geometry.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to go with us?
I was trying to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and straight-forward.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You are twice as old as me.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I missed the ball.
I hate this city.
He now lives in Tokyo.
Programming is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many clocks do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
I don’t like to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us. Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you will be fine.
You panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
Oh, my orange tie.
Is Tom going to cry?
It would have been better to be higher.
I have to help my mom.
His book has inspired me.
Your brothers?
It's not my idea.
You have a plan, right?
He walks.
Tom's not in town.
I had my shoes off.
The next year will be worse.
Mary in a yellow dress.
Love has a bitter taste.
The meeting is over.
You should have done it last year.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I have an old car.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
We went on the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went into the woods in search of insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee is worth two euros.
Motherly love is greater than anything.
He was chasing a thief.
I worked in a restaurant.
I'm not determined enough.
It won’t be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I am interested in music.
I really don’t want to eat now.
The pieces of the mirror were scattered on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She went to school.
Tom sat at the window.
Tom is just like the rest of them.
Tom doesn’t think I should do that.
The government debt is growing.
Why am I me and not you?
Tom probably won’t ever do that.
It's a doll.
Save yourself!
She doesn’t know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bike?
Talk a little.
Tom is smarter.
It was a difficult night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It is important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands that.
She spends too much time on the internet.
You're charming.
Tom said he was going to complain.
Let's get to know him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest it.
Tom is hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We know how to talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You don't need it.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather like?
I'm 30 years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change the diapers.
Do people still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she had dropped out of school.
This word is borrowed from the Greek.
I'm gonna die?
I'm dying, that's how I want to see them.
My brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please, make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There are no rules.
Layla got pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad from raw fish?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom is making breakfast.
There is no doubt that it will rain.
He didn’t mention Australia.
Clearly, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We were actually going to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than me.
For better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He answered my question very easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom is looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love the kids.
Who's missing?
When is she coming?
It's not my style.
Try to stay focused.
I’m so glad I did it yesterday.
Will Tom still live next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Do not throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I say it.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They've made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
This is a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the 2000s.
Tom's probably gonna do this.
It has to be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mother.
After a short peace, the war broke out again.
It's better not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What is the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you give me the sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his house?
“Where’s my laptop?” – “In the chair.”
I don’t think there will be any problems.
Did Tom break up?
You need to cut.
Green is good for you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does it all work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, guys.
I'm fixing the shirt.
When is it expected to return?
I got a good rest.
He is no better than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It would be nice if there were 28 hours in the day, right?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We do not expect to win.
I don't have the money.
I'm not teaching here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Go on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's DJ.
Soon Tom will learn how to swim.
What’s wrong with how I did it?
They know how to catch fish.
Tom came out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom is teaching french.
I tried to get in touch with her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She looked at him as he was swimming.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember the first time we met?
My job is very boring.
He is, so to speak, a robot.
Give us an answer to the question!
You need to be in the hospital.
I can't find the slingshots.
It's a forgery.
It was not Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
That's what I'm hoping for.
Sadly, but it is true.
Is it true that Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, there was a Grand Prix broadcast.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not a native language to me.
I didn’t have any friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So you shouldn’t do it again.
They live there for ten years.
Tom stared at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she is away.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He is often late.
Do you remember the summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know this girl’s father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom won't be able to come with us.
I've scored 30 points.
If I don't do it, Tom's gonna be mad.
Are you not a psychologist?
Don't you write it down?
A big tree fell on the road, and when I went, the road was blocked.
I like Tom's company.
It’s not all gold that shines.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
He didn’t answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don’t you start to get bored?
What do you like about men?
Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I am a student and he is not.
That's what I was trying to do.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new pair of shoes.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko. She was born the same year as me, and now she is preparing for exams.
I don't like coffee or tea.
Have you done your homework?
I think Monday will be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
You might want to help Tom paint the fence.
Why do people behave like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Stupid.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I applied for a visa.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.
The mosquito was broken when we went up the mountain.
Tom is driving.
If you ate fewer hamburgers, you’d probably be healthier.
Tom was helping Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice cream?
Mary isn't coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how it's done.
Don't you have a date with anyone?
All the shops are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Close the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom French.
The apple from the apple tree does not fall far.
Be Realistic .
Who were you talking to?
Your uncle is your father’s or mother’s brother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I would like to ask a question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
I joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you in eternity.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are they?
That's what you want to do, right?
You want to kill me.
You see?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book by Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu and Kyushu.
You're probably too busy.
He doesn’t have a lot of money in the bank.
I guess we should go now.
We didn't do it.
Do you think Tom is crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
You're weak.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare to him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you realize that?
She committed suicide.
We've equipped our office with computers.
You have to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Don’t you plan to stay?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Do you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let’s sing the song together.
He has three times more books than me.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book has become a subject of criticism.
It will be genius.
I'm so scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's a lot worse.
I'm under a fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified in the case of Mary.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You have to quit smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play the violin?
Will you give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom's good at speaking French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
Sami was popular with both students and teachers.
Tears won't help you.
Tom plays football and is a runner-up.
You can go wherever you want.
I’ll see you later with Tom.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know that Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the headphones.
I'll be back soon.
The church is located at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Tom tries to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell Tom to do it.
He speaks Esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn’t do that.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady-in-waiting.
I'll deal with this.
Did you find any errors?
I'd like to see your mother.
You're a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Go away.
You're gonna let Tom fuck you?
You are a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Tom gave Mary a beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
The kids grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He returned to the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
Language carriers subconsciously follow the rules of their language, without even being aware of them.
Tom is on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The thinkers pointed their guns at the elephant.
No one cares.
They were trying.
Is Tom and Mary still here?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
Do you have allergies to something?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn’t help me do that.
I would like to withdraw money.
I squeezed Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
He is no longer a member of this club.
You don’t have to worry about tomorrow’s exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won’t force Mary to do that.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom has lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You didn't run away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend the holidays?
Did you get a Christmas present from Tom this year?
I’m still a little bored at home and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have a problem with remembering.
Where's Mom?
He was awakened three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
There's no need to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom is with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom is a little behind the scenes.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi?
Hurry up, you're late.
It will be difficult.
Is Tom always behaving like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and brother.
Tom didn’t want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You'll never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It all works, you’ll see.
She left him.
Tom is safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
It was a pity to Mary.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom is constantly checking his phone.
How's your wife?
You're quite right.
Tom is not rich, Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I've lost my favorite pen.
Everyone was late, except for me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I'm not going to blow up the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of strange ideas.
- Eat something. - Yeah.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Have you ever had a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going for a walk tonight.
I did.
She was headed to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brasilia.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's that?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, then esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn’t know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you just did your job.
We're going on foot.
Did Tom tell you what exactly happened?
I finally realized that I'm not in love with you.
Did you tell Tom I was joking?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was good.
I'll be in the lab.
Please, just wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the rubbish.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister's always great.
It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him to work, you should take into account his youth.
We're sure it wasn't a coincidence.
It's his intrusive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly walked out of the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check it again.
Tom has a son-doctor.
I know it will be impossible.
Do you have any headaches?
Children imitate their friends, not their parents.
Tom is falling.
Tom wants to play outside with his friends.
No matter what happens, stay calm.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus had already left.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak french.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're pointless.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was a lot harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends were smiling at her.
Let me talk to you, Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt that Tom will be able to win.
Aliens are coming and taking our work from us. Earth for the Earthlings! Let's deport the Marsians!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
You're taking the train?
Tom said that Mary was beautiful.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, right?
Do you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Bring your toys together.
It was a lot harder to do than it seemed.
I think I've done pretty well.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you.
I got better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your work yet?
Three years ago I was very rich.
It's easy to do.
Tom's dead.
I like to be alone.
We were both drunken.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said that, in his opinion, Mary would not.
You missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You seemed to be interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her so much.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked very hard to achieve his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I understand what my mistake is.
I love to travel.
The phone is not working.
That's what we want.
Tom in the sunglasses.
Tom paints well.
All you have to do is to press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I rent a Halloween costume? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Tom's busy and can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried it.
I think I'm getting a fever.
Why don't you sleep?
Do you really think someone is listening to you?
There is no need for surrender!
Tom, you can say it's good.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should have gone earlier.

What's wrong with her?
Are you drinking?

Whatever you want.
I could have changed.

How is your name pronounced?
She keeps the flowers in her hand.
Have you spoken to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man's in his 90s.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where'd you get that?
We're done?
Are you from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You do well to do that, don’t you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I get your coat, please?
I don't share your optimism.

She's got red blood.
What's the matter?
I owe you ten bucks.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.

I’m glad they’re both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see you again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her out on a date.
You're Japanese?
Tom looks scared, though.
When did you come to China?
Do you agree with what Tom is doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
It's nice to meet you, Tom.
This is the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don’t expect them to win.
I fell asleep.
In what way is it my fault?
When it comes to Switzerland, have you been there in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm studying the Vietnamese language.
I'll meet with Tom.

Help me out.

You will be happy.
Tom looked pretty painful when I saw him the last time I saw him.

I have three questions for you.
I’ve met Tom a few times.
Do you use a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot of things together.
Please, move on.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the shop in red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I said hello to Tom.
Tom took the ring off.
I'll arrange your breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke that window?
Your ideas are a little outdated.
