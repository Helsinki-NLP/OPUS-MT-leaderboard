Parliament did not support an amendment to liberate Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an unfavorable deal with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet firm, the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for its approval.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It remains to be determined who the winner is.
As is already customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a matter of clarifying whether they are moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator’s person, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Qur’an.
In Libya an order will be established which we cannot even imagine and which we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans mentioned.
The truth is that it does not come as a surprise that Islamic fighters would be grateful for the help of infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When you look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for locals to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to make themselves with Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it is possible that the West may finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as Sharia followers don't cross us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go on the hunt for investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% forecast, France's 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (0.3% growth instead of 0.1%), although in France there was a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarter period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> the trend towards a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development is shaped.
The results are even worse than analysts' predictions.
Main events:
Annually, the Czech economy grew 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problem situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on ten-year Czech bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is deteriorating.
In Germany, there are voices that say that the ECB should grant loans at the end of the day.
The Czechs qualify for the European Cup.
They won 1-0 and celebrated the qualifying with a bonus of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was 1-0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so the European Championship appointment will not be missed.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates their pass to the European Championship.
Due to the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who let two great occasions pass.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup appointment, so the national football arches will receive an approximate reward of 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes, a good offensive game was played.
Both teams worked hard just to keep the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students set out to pray Tuesday afternoon in front of the facilities and then choreographed death slogans to the US and Israel.
Hundreds of university students trained human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in which uranium is being worked.
They want to prove that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is seeking nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students started praying at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, which would be aimed at paralyzing the Iranian nuclear program, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched, would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no built-in breakfast and dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity affecting 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is again shown the importance of the environment where you grow for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessive children feed, for example, on nests at least twice as often as children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program “Obesity is not a coincidence.”
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and almost 900 children from all over the Czech Republic participated in the same.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determinants, which significantly decrease the number of overweight and even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed have answered that they have five daily meals according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, meal, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” one of the survey’s results found.
No breakfast but with built-in for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, such as having a set time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each has its own breakfast.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of the households nothing is breakfasted.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, crazy chips are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet refreshments daily (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make Your Diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offerings according to their tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years from the point of view of a healthy diet are far from ideal."
His favorite foods include pasta, meat and sweets.
"It's especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments," the study's final report warns.
As the main food, the palm is taken from the pasta and the poultry meat is closely followed.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after completing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a significant change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet," the study results point out.
Attention is drawn, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal, running water.
Children would also more often choose poultry meat and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and a seminar on how it works in the world of show.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin fit.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there are no men) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften a wide shoulder, extend a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given some tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress it too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one extra piece of tailored fabric.
You will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that doesn’t stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many kinds of various and also body information, so I am happy that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous, to whom he will have to design two wardrobes: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
It's time for me to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Scream from the inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who will have recently weighed about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena G<0xC3><0xB3>mez.
We have to cut the dresses from the magazines or search them on the internet and print them out, then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of the styling.
The designer, therefore, not only physically dressed, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All this was told by designer and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But all of this is for Sunday.
The designer has to have a global vision.
The three invited specialists encouraged Saturday’s conference with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed as classic with jeans and a t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it was actually a dress.
Or just take it off and raise your neck to get a completely different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To get to work, you first need to know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
I finally understand why we memorize all those formulas, what it combines with why, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing on the reservation than he intends to photograph.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus, ten outfits), you need to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes works in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this needs to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that the image and style themselves, in many cases, constitute half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance doesn’t matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, you have to keep in mind that they are very likely to indicate us a size very different from your real (minor) size.
Then you just have to google and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the topic, if a certain celebrity has thickened/fat, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion, but he has to understand about outfit.
During your work, you should primarily communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss them, he defends his opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify her outfit and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can’t pick up and throw away everything there was and say, ‘Oh, what a horror.’”
“Find at least a couple of things that you can weigh and recommend so someone can put them on,” Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
It is fixed around the waist and has all the necessary tools there.
There are also nylon yarn (serving the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or caps), special clamps for hanging clothes on the front, if this is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed), because they could give you a set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole and much more the exterior could be damaged.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So I had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don't get very well with those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a rose road, but I don’t care what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you will be competing all over America.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Review
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated due to a series of improper carelessness from a routine trip during the morning shift.
To a certain extent it was able to meet expectations, but that is of no use if, in reality, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new release, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused high expectations even before its release.
It promised to give new air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as shown, appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre again.
We also felt curious to know what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is usually the case in the NFS series, the results did not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that may seem acceptable, but in the total computation you lose points due to absurd failures, which have already been appearing in the series for years.
In fact, they can’t even call mistakes, but rather it’s the incomprehensible misunderstanding of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
He introduces you to a story whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to take part in an illegal race across America.
You're sitting at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it follows that each race takes place along a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphics is equivalent to previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the snow-capped high mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that diminishes visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a few models, but that is enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to save time (timed classic duel) and then you get a duel against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this sometimes comes the police, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite a few landscapes in the game than you would expect (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with enough action fits this driving style quite well, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything is fine.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
Games of this type can not be expected to recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that, by making a very tight advance or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume all of them, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it’s nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it’s not very reliable.
Sometimes, even the reset doesn’t help, it just helps you learn the given memory step.
A big drawback of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent goes ahead without problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or brake.
It doesn’t matter when you arrive, because it’s programmed that the “surprise” will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at sites where, regardless of the time, you will always be ahead of the same opponent on the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it comes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front, so at first you can pop the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it is a pity, because even if the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action, so it is often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit gets the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the qualifying in the race so it doesn’t get bored, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas stations next to the road, because that’s where you have to change your car, although in the vast majority of cases you’ll have enough of what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition to main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will get to know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community features available.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
By car you get to the metro tunnel (pass), where you get to run in the dark through the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the convoy of the metro and takes you ahead without further ado.
In the drafting we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one even thought a little or if the real authors take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
It is a pity that in the most tense moments the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This particularly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the "each of his father and mother" category, but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoids absolutely stupid mistakes, we’d have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but get ready because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.

EU Ambassador Vice-President Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and eurosceptic.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without a quarter.”
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
How not to take his motto "clear and openly about Europe" seriously, which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, for it would be the envy of many lecturers at the U. Carolina Faculty of Law.
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also considered the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“The first thing that comes up is criticism, that if he is insult, a gray official, able to take on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he takes on his roles perfectly.”
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative for Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?", which is an important step towards unification and clarification of political union in the face of states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> has also dealt with the agenda that the European Council will continue, continue and will continue in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good riot", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, needs to be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support, and which countries will receive the least?
The ambassador also recalled her main motto, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
“The truth is I don’t like ugly abbreviations, alienisms, or jergas that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for eurosceptics and people perceive the negatives rather than the positives.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is of a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says to me, 'What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?', and you see that it doesn't make any sense to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, expects very tough new rules of fiscal policy for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.”
“It was said for the first time that only countries who want to cooperate and those who don’t, should stay out.”
“These procedures will be more and more and will reinforce Europe at both speeds,” Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be debated among member states, not just among members of the eurozone.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the most approximate would be “long term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has already been a hundred years since its founding.
The basis of this platonic character was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
“For us, IBM involves long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, current director of the company.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, took care of his employees as the Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a businessman in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were the first U.S. operators to enjoy paid vacations, safe, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan to replace Palmisano next year with a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for 30 years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, from which emerge an innumerable number of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that they overlap with ideas, as almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology enterprise,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that is trying to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between getting into the business and creating a business directly.
IBM – or the “green green” – as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the world’s largest companies.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial exchanges, barcodes and floppy disks.
This year, IBM has become the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on progress, you can’t emotionally anchor in the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don’t work, abandons them).
And that’s the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which is basically maintained and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is primarily dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and another-fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the share of suppliers.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM is acting on the assumptions of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Economic Crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased stratosphericly to 120%, the company’s net profit has continued to increase.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
You can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The foundation that led to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "Fixer Clock", which allows you to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson led the company, revenue doubled by $9 million and the company began large expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years occupying the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peces", which established the computer standard of that time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, i.e., “a smarter planet.”
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances have improved, for example, in terms of transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia then, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Also here there is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said <0xC2><0xA1>It's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Josef would awaken from his pink dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> into her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
And the Knight doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If one day Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, his wife would not expect him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old man who was wrong, but as a man to whom I am bound by certain ties," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that he had already disbanded her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph doesn’t care that a woman has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and no change is possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
“The company is still in place, I do the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping.”
"Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> found a new love, he would not object.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility,” concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize you in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of men?
Go to shopping
Do you blame your orange half for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one bag a week?
Do you like to shop often at discounts?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should calm their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to stroll through the clothing stores, look for well-fitted clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner that you better wait for her at the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
“I’d need to lose at least five pounds – should I start exercising?”
"Do you really like it?"
Doesn't that sound like you?
What do you mean?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her look.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about your physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more frequent complaints are, the more annoying women become.
Cleanliness and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite thiovivo.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove the dust, rub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a freshly clean washbasin and a glass door shelf that cost so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness certainly should not occupy be primordial in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make Unpleasant Comments
"Used socks are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too."
"The wet cloth is not left on the ground!"
If you do these cometaries to your partner more than once a day, know that you will be able to get them out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Bullying and gossip
Some women also suffer from slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about things like who, where, with whom, how and why together.
Perhaps each one of us sometimes misses a small and harmless joke.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who are uncontrolled, who love to gossip and often do, who despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female workforce.
Jagr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in the NHL match on Monday with two assists that brought the 5:3 victory over Philadelphia on the Carolina field and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old's move, took another step and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also Jagr's partner, Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, Jagr told reporters overseas that Giroux had predicted a great night.
“Before the game, I told him I was going to triple.”
“I presented him.”
"Sometimes they look ambushed," Jagr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first trap.
A while later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trail.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek made the record behind the Hurricanes and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second half the Flyers already dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr he scored the third goal, after his shot collided by Wayne Simmonds' fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the pitch, but he's definitely among the top three," Jagr said.
“I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with an athlete like him.
"I'm very pleased with that."
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my team-mates played for me, and that now produces results.”
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, from penalty, until they got a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, although they ended up outnumbered two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"It mirrored the disc, I took the speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the final goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has placed itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury to the upper body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with one veteran player, the rest were novels.
“Finally, but it is that nothing can be done about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much to rotate the players turned against us, we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
“And so we left gaps,” one of the defenders, P. K. Subban, explained.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in a 5–2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who ended a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 in Czechoslovakia there were only five authorized state travel agencies: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, as trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists were therefore on holiday to the beaches of the DDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned west and Czech tourists' travel was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise, individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but one had to put on a queue with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "well-known" in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way the Czechs travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the DRC or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that the current favourite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not get tired of excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to bring with them food (preserves, pastries, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in the demand for travel agencies began, starting in 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare travel using charter flights, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, and went to Thailand.
From that year onwards, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart to far and hot countries every year. This winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in their history, Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head on trips abroad, including on-site expenses.
The Ordinary General Assembly was convened to elect the president, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convocation of the next Extraordinary General Assembly to take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote for one of the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not without convening his colleagues in order to find a strong person who could handle football in the future.
However, after the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era ended, a controversy broke out between the two association federations unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (N<0xC3><0xA1>rodn<0xC3><0xAD> d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague district of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, because the talks had been blocked and not just about the method of election.
No consensus was reached either as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment onwards, and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code are still open.
Nor could the Executive Committee shed any more light on the situation, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is this: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead end?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy.
The Region of Moravia is willing to make a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," that is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more suited to Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted to the maximum in accordance with the statutes."
“So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who first runs as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All the passions will be appeased with today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
“Football will once again be the protagonist, and so will cooperate more gladly,” says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement is reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
“This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
"However, I hope common sense will be enforced," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the start of the game if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties to the most powerful sports organization in the country in order to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sports (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) that will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k will fight for the presidency, because he cannot find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen footballers, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not be nominated as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a right person, I would be fighting for her and not running for the election."
"But to this day no such person has been found," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the election, who opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also points out that, if he wins, he will remain in the position of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly will come.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I could take into account.”
“It was crazy for me to hear some say that at this point they don’t even want to identify with Czech football.”
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What is supposedly most bothering Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k at the moment is Pelta’s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known off-world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, the status will remain and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring to Pelta's victory."
“And with what eyes the UEFA and FIFA will look at us,” said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who also takes some caution in his previous statement that “I would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta became president.”
In case of winning Thursday’s elections, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
“He [Pelta] would be the first to follow.”
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine it, for example, as head of the show.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
"I also don't put my nose where I don't feel capable," added Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September attracted much attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He draws on his management skills from private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which pressure was exerted on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be dedicated to.”
“If they raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop,” he said.
In addition, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k now does not even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R President should be "not a supporter".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But I don’t see any sense in the fact that I hypocritically cede my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then return there after a year and a half,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the election deadlock.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, it would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral rules.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well for him to defend and present, in a wider context, his ideas on the management of football.
“People at all levels have been engaged in football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president this Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who mainly associates with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in Sparta and the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, in the June General Assembly the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta said.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a veil to win delegates.
"If they elect me president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in case this fails."
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist,” says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, he tries not to interfere with his opponents.
In the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with his head.
"It's been more than a year in the world of football, and it's already achieved some successes."
"His attacks but they were shameful and a lot of people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," Pelta told his opponent, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
“I would also try to resolve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Immediately afterwards I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure there is enough money for the whole of football,” the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not result in any personal changes to the squad.
“I would have to know the tasks of each employee first,” he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios facing the upcoming General Assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would begin to work eagerly.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to solving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by the previous president Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, through professional football or the training of high-performance young players."
“With this I don’t want to say that I would do it all alone,” Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the competencies of the executive committee so that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area.”
"And I will allocate difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
“A lot of people probably won’t like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everybody knows I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent and hinder me at every step," he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith not to leave like that, no more,” he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work he already started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work that I don’t want to lose is over.”
"There are processes that have started and will have their effect in a couple of years and I don't want anyone to stop them," he announced concerned that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before Hasek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so it would be just a privilege for a few chosen.”
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I'm trying to be objective."
“I want to make football for everyone, because that’s the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
“Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division.”
"There would be no current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes,” Rajchl said, whose successes include the saving of tens of millions of crowns from disadvantaged contracts, the law-making of television contracts and the law negotiations.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the blame that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year.”
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek already started and would not significantly change the staffing on the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible point of view, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missed in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Laying her back on the water, she looked up at the artistic dome, swam towards the marble angels, waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and was astonished at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, he took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and one city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathing fans have to conform to blue tiles and chlorine scent, while running fans can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the joyful squirrels of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why pools always have to be so ugly,” says this resident of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The bathing in the pool and the essential oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes an effort, the indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of flooring, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
“On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building.”
Everything is optically folded: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical wellness oasis, but mainly gives the desire to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, you will find the nitrate water in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a terremo-shaped building.
Many outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts your eyes on the Zurich roofed pool, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the skis in the practice.
The most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: <0xC3><0x96>tztal’s water cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources steam rises in winter, while in the background the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the odor of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulfur, in the baths of Arp<0xC3><0xA1>d in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe it has reached a sanitary bath.
The scent comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose leggings stick to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for nice places to bathe, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, she found herself with a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the collapsed windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds growing between the tiles.
The decline was countered by a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the times of its construction in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of pool collector Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace, the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw materials business
by Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges cause prices to rise, and banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank, although major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, bets on commodities were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business “deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank’s directive, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
By the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, hailed the news, but reaffirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "Bets on rising food prices show particularly drastic how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest banker, especially in debt.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at stake for food price bets,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann addresses the issue of people going hungry or the fame of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the consortium chief wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was unplanned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation you can perfect your image.
And you need to barely care about possible losses, your successor will take care of that.
Two-Thirds Annul Investment in Raw Materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices would be wagered.
Many of the bank’s customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agrarian speculation.
43 percent would not recommend such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflecting, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, left empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
The modern post-war architecture is passionate, the clear shapes, the glass halls, the bold curves and the new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels 1958 is a suitable example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the flattened adjacent building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten near the southern station of Vienna, was renovated in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated, it was called the "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the space and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, or a good atmosphere.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now called "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, has made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skating in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the museum of modern art in Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and patrons of the monuments.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation of the same name are on display, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore, and an office building should also be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his move to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In today’s reforms there are big problems, the building was “an energy eater,” Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a light panel lowered between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old mahogany shades and protected against oxidation.
And the cinema room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap, and also liked the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, said Krischanitz recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why I wanted to “awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been an urban success. The completely new and planned "town of the central station", with housing and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another blow of luck happens: House 21 could receive reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as it is heard, negotiates with the city on a nearby site in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multi-million-dollar winter crisis package
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train failures and delays caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the planned investments up to 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
In order to achieve better availability of vehicles and the rail network even with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to bend internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from tracks and lanes.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice avenues for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays also this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a shaft break at Cologne’s central station.
Deutsche Bank pays fines in the U.S.
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem emerges, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses many large banks of inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks to the depths.
“We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides support in the event of bankruptcy to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is trying to reintegrate the millions of losses incurred.
The agreements currently concluded are their first type.
The regulator had also ordered accounts from other major banks and filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, there is currently a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have set in motion countless processes for receiving compensation or penalizing faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
It accuses the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, it deals worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to “substantial losses,” without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debt as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The guru of finance, Buffett, invests heavily in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies since the long-term development forecasts of the companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s commercial report and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before IBM primarily offered services and sought out computer systems for other companies’ information technology departments.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed on economy broadcaster CNBC that he has acquired shares in IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has soared to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM did not know anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of computing centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a number of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM stocks on the stock market rose one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The Threat Is Concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper talks about a “bloody ideology” that rekindles itself.
The murders of eight small-business tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin comes back a ghost that was thought dead long ago, since the fire-like attacks on Mölln in November 1992 and on Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of violence against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The uncovered ultra-right grid reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived again?", headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a whistle: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He points out that the murderers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the police's behaviour and subsequent success in the searches are very critically discussed.
The authors are shocked that the German authorities have not long sought suspects in the ultra-right circle.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on, the immigrants are lost, they have only self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," Selen writes.
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen will be cleared in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other incident has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group sentiment of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was then criticized mainly for the deficiency of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel replaced him at the funeral in Cologne, and Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contribute to the taxes.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated according to the amount of their taxes.
The current information in the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has been since.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The Bank of the Zurich Lake Scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices in public, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops friendly remarks about his future colleagues.
"USB has achieved a revitalization".
"Me leega collaborar con Kaspar Villiger y Oswald Grübel".
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the bank and failed 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the board of directors of the USB was considered equally touched since then, and everyone asked: When will Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been expected to advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of certainly necessary adaptation.
He takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just re-proved that it deserves the title “Europe’s biggest bank scandal” for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has been slipping from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the former so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis has begun.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also handsome, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s big banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: “In front of my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank.”
“From the current point of view, one wonders: how could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very smart banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses in high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some looked with contempt until recently: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 at the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, the UBS was in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to hand over data from wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
In doing so, UBS admitted to having more or less helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for rich clients: the discretionary aureola.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of clients' funds.
In this way, within a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in asset management through aid to tax fraud.
And just when something calmer came back, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator cheated 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
“With the Adoboli case, it turns out that the risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls.”
Thus arose the idea of precaution, with which the Swiss bankers had been present for a long time, to be the guardians of the world’s largest assets: no too great risk, instead, the security of money wants to break the other side of the Alpine republic.
Swiss bank security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t match the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered in Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry such as Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have lived here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate the "safety".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, according to the president of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both major banks.
The UBS has become too big, he thinks, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was evident.
“That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,” author Lukas Hässig writes in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they feel?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, that’s how you see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank arises that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served for the two different precursor banks of UBS to complement each other: a rich but dormant bank with the center of wealth management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to get a step from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel rejoined Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: the dissatisfaction came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, where Wuffli, the consortium head, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange trades and in stock trading it was at its highest.
However, the consultants in charge of companies highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the “fixed income” banking language, there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Growing avid, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American mortgages and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, sought the downturn for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, an expert in banking.
So great is the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
Posts at the UBS became projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, whoever runs a large bank, has a job that is almost impossible.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banking, has an idea, ending investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to get that far (yet).
But investment banking has to go down a lot, it’s clear right now.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss as a transitional solution, since the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he insisted: He must permanently run the business of UBS, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Removing 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking right now.
So far, he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market

Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.

Instead, throw a decade of old principles overboard and enter the U.S. tech sector.

Smart grids are spreading in cities
In many places grains are considered “problematic birds”: these very intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the grease belongs to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the dirt and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no means have appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
The grains are no longer leaving the cities, say experts at the first grain symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected fats; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
Hunting, the growing building and the falling of trees that house them make life difficult for birds.
The grains are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, the negative headlines of the press jumped a controversial project to mass-kill the district's grains.
Critics have rated animal hunting by traps for birds and killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"By kicking them out and driving them out in a normal way, nothing can be achieved," said Werner Klöver, an urbanist and landscaper from Leer.
Shooting with water at the nests or pulling trees are often undesirable consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are diverted, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere.”
Hiding them is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem in cities cannot be solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of evacuating animals from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle them elsewhere.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a spike in the face with applause."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on Asheberger grains, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of bird noise: "Everything is forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, grains not only take advantage of the resources to access bits of squirrels, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four grades how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the clever fats had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the spike.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the puller of the tube.
Three of the four grates got it in the first attempt.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for the 2012 European Cup in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the one-way match, made all five European Cup appearances in a row.
The Czechs scored 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs home game with the outsider Montenegro, after in the one-way game (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia did not let him be scored in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a 1-1 (1-0) loose against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice to Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African World Cup play-offs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a straight freestyle from more than 30 meters to get to the top in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from afar and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who didn’t look good in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of the English Manchester City, sent a header to the pole, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scored for Czech Republic
Then, Ergolding’s college student Wolfgang Stark was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of penati Bosnia, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself on the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark posed a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion cleared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth time in a row for the European Cup.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own goal (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the turn of the front, very right at the goal of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper from the world-famous goalkeeper, the forward of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end ended the game.
In the meantime, Turkey took advantage of the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his seat at the 2002 World Cup third-place bench, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the European Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the 7th minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goals be scored.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute took place Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatton goes to the European Cup
In Dublin, the Irish are celebrating their first European participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed 4-0 in the one-way game prepared for a previous decision, set himself to head in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the temporary defense avoided possible lead goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he was ahead of him.
After a defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball through the line, scoring 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software maker, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double its workforce in the country.
Until 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will circulate, the dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
“We will get more facilities for research and development and hire workers,” Bill McDermott, co-chair, said at a conference in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 workers currently to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are headquartered in the boom country.
The growth plans in China are also an important element of the dax consortium’s 2012 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales volume by 2015 to 20 billion euros.
Last year, it came in about 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider that employs 50,000 workers worldwide, is doing as well as few times in the past.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“We currently want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to activate sustainable growth in China through broad instruction.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one fall to the ground.
Here are some action tips: Smoothly start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr Englund’s novelist narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unconventional book, which rightly describes it as “an anti-history work.”
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists, or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle "combines the experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from college and botanicals to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrations.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr Englund’s book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was only the disastrous trench war on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" is expertly moved through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the bees; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an unbearable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that ravages Cordita.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what’s going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
"A lack of facts," Mr Englund notes, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and the Pain of Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be terrifying or moving, but they are more life-filled in Mr Englund’s accumulation of small moments, lost details.
Many of these are about deprivations and dealing with what is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Successors, everywhere successors."
"Coffee successor, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the succession of food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into lamb fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and dried potato pellets; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, notes, "837 meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive towards savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barba."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will find out or care.
“Once you give up the thought of sacrificing yourself, you’d like to think it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it horribly resembles “a convicted man being strangulated in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” Mr Englund writes, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the young century’s bestiary: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-dressed clothes who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both noble and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund talks about soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embroidery with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often leads to a lifetime blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is agile but not extravagant and perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way the war unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell’s modern memory, or novels like Novelty in front of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, torn from your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a cherry.
After a false precedent step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen from Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more vacant.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was plagued by challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the spraying of pepper spray on the protesters, violating the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "occupiers."
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared to see how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The agents increased so-called riot training — counterterrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
“The few cops I know who were called for this, they weren’t told it was to enter Zuccotti Park,” the person, who spoke anonymously, said.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said many people, such as those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do so when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Service Unit trucks with focal points and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue winds, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No tents were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent police from entering the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr Browne said the mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the dense swamp of demonstrators’ personal belongings, including luggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic stuffed with clothes, Cleaning Department equipment followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were hanging between their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The eviction operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “alteration of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives of the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out flying from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, alleging that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents’ coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring’s presuppositional work, Brego’s access to a health care fund by the city.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied the charge.
At a hearing in the City Hall last month, education adviser Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the school's support staff would be fired.
District 37 officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been insufficiently subsidized by form.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.D. District 36’s budget fell 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been misled by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more often describes the act of moving a teacher from the payroll of a school to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parents coordinators were fired,” says the draft complaint, “and not just in excess.”
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the Libyan uprising.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and the U.S. involvement came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut-independent), applauding the U.S. for its "successful and successful U.S.
“This resolution is to honor the brave Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It’s a bipartisan affirmation of support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties fought with each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory – with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually trim the grass under his feet.
Subsequently, Congress’s indecision was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves” and “honours the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary professionalism.”
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's chief Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia Republican), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have so far been unsuccessful in bringing their amendments to the Assembly, but not because of a lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated – the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate – and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment alone in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors — especially novice Republicans looking to refine their resumes — the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of the amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfill, while Representative José E. Serrano (New York Democrat) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
One amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that the members have been when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Gopped but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman fired on his clothes at a constituent event in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democrat) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with Broadway’s melody “Congres will come back tomorrow” and said he wanted more.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he unexpectedly returned to the House to issue his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang – and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special "20/20" that aired on the eve of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up, while her husband animates her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frown of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toasted," a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Falling."
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn’t remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she arrested him for the first time to ask about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspected gunman Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point of his wife's recovery, she said: "I have been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
“You’ve just been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make them feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and naval infantry broke into their posts around him.
The label crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as then Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were shown as a kind of orphaned child,” the official wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
Significantly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adored, American public.
He prodigies the troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, say service members.
The public is increasingly acting as if those uniforms were bothering them.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about grief are conducted silently and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Navy, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran below the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with the negative impressions,” Cancian reminded his children.
Military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The Army Faces Increasing Pressure to End Rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to the rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-time soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a 12-can package of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded like an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the native of Texas put aside her concern.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
A few minutes after entering Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military staff members are eagerly awaiting a court decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to Reuters.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were sexually raped or assaulted by their peers, and that the army subsequently failed to properly investigate, prosecute or prosecute them.
Burke says he's going over the army's top floor, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted with her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy—in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
For a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active-duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: Between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other lawsuits are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is compiling a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to give them a discontinuation of service - a common human event, according to activists.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are remarkably under-reported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which amounts to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army went to trial – half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe his attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In the Lyman case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor—a cut in her arm—was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked if he had had sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commanding officer, ""That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unsuitable for service.
In January 2010 she was dispensed from service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow lawsuits continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that it raises responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go your way, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until the reform takes place,” he says.
"Or until we die, whichever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another type that aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to reach them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published on European digital populism by the UK’s DEMOS Study Center.
Facebook’s personal information alignment is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy — the way sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans from right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
On arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s an entirely new way of doing research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a sort of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen.”
DEMOS’ work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in "Likes," messages on the walls, and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a spike in research, boosting the number of academic papers with the site name in the title to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t get close to with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to go through the game, and they’d never let you in,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook eliminates all that – you go to them directly.”
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social-health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that college students who spoke about their drinking habits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their intoxicants.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Institute for Child Research, the Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “pinking” its own population to get data.
The site Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed information - data should be accessed by other digital freedom advocates for a long time to support the site).
However, Facebook users know that the site is monitoring them, like it or not – the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that carried out with students’ public Facebook walls.
“As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a subject of research is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know what part of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper holder and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social is still happening offline.”
Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brains of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it has been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I admit the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he was locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge determined he was not a mentally ill person, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically alleviate the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," a relative of a victim said.
"It would be much easier if it seemed."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Missed Interview Showed at a Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford—distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been debunked as an advance to a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flow charts – a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringley was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At the time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new computer company NeXT, awaiting the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely’s interview was used on Nerds, he said the interview’s originals disappeared during their transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy on VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited archive material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost 68-Minute Interview, which arrives at Landmark Cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringley’s questions, prompting him to move faster toward topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod, or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the dreamer looking forward to the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
“Over the years in business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers that invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs brings to the detail his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Disconcerted by the way costs were recorded—often starting with a "standard cost" that was made to the eye of a good cover, and then adjusted with a "variable"—he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine commercial costs in detail.
The Pope's Joke:
Jobs recounts the “Blue Box” he built himself with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and yelling through the public phone and a minute later I came back to the public phone from the door next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us, we didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two exploded in rushes just before the Pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and phone sales with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, in search of spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone guide and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated its employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste my time with that machine and write programs for it.
About improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Early in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of baseplates, a customer asked him if he could assemble the whole team.
Working with only 30 credit days, he had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On the big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s revival, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of his market share.
“He says you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, so what?”
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it’s these kinds of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that position of monopoly is tainted by people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the victory's defeat.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make electrons do, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, it all comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What in part made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were accidentally the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, I might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Health Care Law Rivals While Court Accepts Case
The day the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were entertained at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to file the lawsuit and, in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour historic claim is expected by March, and the result is likely to further turmoil the 2012 presidential race, which will be at its peak by the time the court’s decision becomes known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and claim that the law should be discarded will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests for dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia’s absolute closeness to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges that the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were entertained in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases in court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say they too easily mix court activity with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that it is Justice Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as attorney general of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law as it is now being impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he will.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
Rarely is news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 planes is a record $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial jets for its value in dollars - 50 double-passer Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from the airline Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which presupposes fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is over $1 billion.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices – usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs – is not so harmful, because the country is making money with rising oil prices.
That’s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps to keep at bay its Airbus SAS competitor’s attempt to invade their domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing’s win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co’s shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's sister, apparently defeated in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n's vote
Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the dispute for governor.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole country," Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they seized the ballot boxes, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the setting of a comeback, and the victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have outperformed Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who had led the polls before the election.
Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, a candidate of his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the position of governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidatures out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing Europe’s difficulties in an “unbiased” way and said Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can’t be immune.”
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s debt costs have skyrocketed dangerously and Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to join forces to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance — such as the purchase of bonds from the EU's bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund — offered greater bargaining power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the drop in exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to India’s billion-two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that’s not going to go well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs from poorly managed companies, and loss-making companies such as railroads.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens with “significant chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing “risks downwards” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the impending automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digging $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress's failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "abduction," would result in 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
“We would also be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to lay off civilians in order to meet the goal.”
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the goodwill.”
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While funding for wartime contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions to basic budgets,” Panetta warned.
"The hiring of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and oversight of the war-supporting contract."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping at the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s main military power.”
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result you can live with, and it is certainly not one we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senatorial warnings will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts is yet to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, even though she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting in Congress and the White House and knowing she was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a shadowy panorama of what might be ahead — an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential opponents.”
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how the reductions "generate significant operational risks: delays in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and committed worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk of combat in future operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal battleship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and further testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines shows us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually abetting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “picked” with an open microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made the ridicule with his denials quickly repelled by the irrefutable test.
Former Presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infractions in campaign funding related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one living it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton in lying during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating in school and university exams are very widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have given test responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That’s for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: “I have you,” detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars do look in the eyes.
They don’t always sneeze, sneeze, rub or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, the microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and the times.
I spent several years surveying scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if its professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more lies "oriented towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often than married people to their spouses.
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline".
It helps to provide benchmarks to measure changes afterwards.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally hits your foot all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when they see your feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for deceptive, verbal and non-verbal groups of behavior.
Consider these groups of behavior as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the top of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview unhook” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and posture change once all the difficult questions are over.
Questionnaires often falsely show that the interview has ended just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his leg to the bottom and used the past time as he claimed his murdered wife was alive, launching a national search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... to what I know... to my understanding."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Deflected After U.S. Threat of Delay in Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering trade unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and hopes the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay the decision on a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are studied.
“This is a true path to progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to separate any decision by 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed their full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have wagered on an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only raised limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if TransCanada’s hired lobbyist Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her little daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
"Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribe scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Someone came up from behind and said to me, ‘You know what your daughter is doing?’ I said, ‘Yes, and I went to pick her up,’” he said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman in anger.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left her daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He got angry and started using bad words - the C word and the J word out loud...
He had a bottle of water and he started to throw the water out of the bottle over me.”
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’” said the girl’s mother.
LaBelle shrugged at her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled back to a car waiting for her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a cancer support association.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his behavior,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when you address a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, decreased foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-denominated of the change, which generated great expectations about the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, economic development is not observed growth, instead there is a main deterioration in the indicators.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing billionaire losses for the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical economic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture.
According to the report of impacts by the frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages in 582,000 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent was partially damaged, the main corn crops were sinister.
The decline in economic activity has generated a steady increase in unemployment in the state until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. In the first three quarters of the year, the rate of state unemployment was increased by a steady increase in the number of people, while in January to March, there was an increase in the number of people, while in January to March, there was an increase in the number of people, with a steady increase in unemployment, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a resource restriction by the legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest them.”
Immigration Detained
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and secondly because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Informal
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the occupied population in the state works without being quoting as a worker before any social security institution.
Along with unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor lags are the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloese workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
IED contraction
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the State Department of Economics from January to June of the IED itself amounted to $630,000,697 million during the previous year, which represents a decrease of $14,697 million year-on-year, from $87.374 per cent.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the face of the economic contraction scenario, the state government asked the state congress in July for approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, the same would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, not to revitalize the economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of wills of different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the efforts of all and above all the good already synchronized progress of this new team of Government.
Economic slowdown
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we were closing well below expectations.”
Re-define vocation
To Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana in Sinaloa, he said that the state is required to engage in productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource Sinaloa has to unleash,” he said.
I work to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better fits the government’s efforts.
"Generally speaking, I would say that the Government has been striving to deliver good results in different areas, there is some progress in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He was sentenced to eight pounds of marijuana.
A neighbour of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug addict is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez street, in front of post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug addict was driving in a pick-up truck, white, where he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle box and in the co-pilot seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentence continues internally at the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
He owes contributions to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk of failing to comply with the State Government ' s corresponding contributions, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these becomes effective.
“Almost 12 million are what they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end we have not given a fifth, when since July they had to give us a share,” he said, “we have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute at that time.
“It already happened to us in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left outstanding,” he said.
Although there is a commitment by the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the actions so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They’re almost 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Cut validates "analog slurry" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversies that put the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree ahead of the so-called "analogous slump" from 2021 to 2015, by failing to gather the eight votes needed to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was rejected for not reaching a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to reject the request made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the draft, also by Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general rules measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the state rectory.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalisation, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, “require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectification of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, that somehow invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, since in the administrative sphere is provided compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
Analyze the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,744 total records.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, yet the total number of votes corresponds to 8.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not homologate his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel argued that he had made Odico Odico in his publication.
On November 9, the nation’s Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the state’s vote on constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal,” since it has no right to “sanction or veto them.”
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counting of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and calculation in the file of the box or does not open under the power of the president thereof; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations of acts.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than a percentage point; provided that the candidate represents the post-election of the party at the beginning of the session.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the ordinary calculation it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second-placed.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
Their ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday were held reconnaissance and a requiem mass.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel's last will was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute from the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the most attached people attended the ceremony at Camp Marte.
At 12 noon, the Colonel’s ashes reached the guard chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he was even dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "I was almost in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for his family’s graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: flying an airplane.
Give him the last goodbye.

Three bodies found in Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the finding, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with grace shot, on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery occurred on the 1.5-kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the quinta, whose barda is beige with coffee, there was the open door from pair to pair.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow beach with dark mesh pants, without shoes; next to him was a white beach with straps.
A few feet away was the body of another individual with a red flag and blue mesh pants.
All three were face down.
According to data obtained at the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no caps were found on the site.
In the barda of the fifth are seen legends that go from one organized crime group to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretariat presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "halcone" and clandestine burials.
According to information released, in a first fact on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony eight people were arrested and one who remained deprived of their freedom was rescued.
They were secured three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "The Zetas".
In another incident on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in the village of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plaques and with two subjects on board.
As they scored high and carried out the inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, one of his accomplices in the ejido La Frauda was stopped on November 13 at 14:00, who, upon seeing the military, tried to escape.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he would present to the president the result of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “frame is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough package of austerity demanded by European leaders to regain the beaten trust in Italy.
Emphasizing pressure on Monti to rush, market instability put the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government a lot.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, the centre-right party's secretary, told the press.
The support of PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italy’s debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections go ahead.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish's roce is superior to the Tico's
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten outperform the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 summoned reached the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for the friendly today, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, account for an extensive record of Class A intersection games, Tricolor only owns defender Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
That figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful Premier League clubs in England, maintain yearly intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as the Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with Furia Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ola in complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Ticco footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international standing in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish national team is the archer <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, cerebral steering wheel of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized by UEFA the previous week along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of the Schalke, Raul Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Near the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Tico side, and near Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a, are the left side Junior Diaz, with 48 attendances and the artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five beat the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 attendances, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson still not debut.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country on its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to deliver one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was assured by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the band Angelina The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is on The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have only been in Costa Rica once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay there for a few days.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I wonder because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live with intensity the days before.
What do you tell your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have happened over the past couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Upon seeing the tour, they have come to deliver huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we’ve never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it makes it more interesting for people as well.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us would imagine we’d be in a big rock band and having done it for more than 20 years ago would sound like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are so excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something unusual.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it’s much more strange when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with them all yet and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do they find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don’t be too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of great crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without capturing yourself for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and we never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work and have music, to laugh, to do music.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite not being a fashionista anymore?
I think we all always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer of the tongue he has been operated on four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, said he did not want it because he is known innocent.
He was operated on four times from cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms to which have been joined other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been incarcerated since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be “proper for the exchange of information on all political issues between the two nations,” the South American presidency said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s "grey list", made up of countries that did not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoted plumber passes all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had he done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without wearing glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo's head of specialized press in Spain, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez pointed out that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", as so far hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "easy" to engage less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to give a "second round" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "Aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also implies the character's return to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo turns fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting in that the plumber of the mustache will have to travel mined platforms of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom supports Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had given way to the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that requested Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of law had already ordered extradition.
He asserted that during his term of office he "did not put his hands" on court decisions and gave way to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
Colom’s act is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional instances to prosecute the former candidate between 2000 and 2004 were exhausted.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process before the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of untrained boys
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over the course of this quarter century.
This adds to the 100 long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served to balance yesterday in an event held at the former factory complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dog tradition or in a situation of falling into the margins.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of responsible entities and institutions that over the past 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full-time elections, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former councillor of socialist education, Ernest Maragall, and the extenent mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gom<0xC3><0xA0>.
They also visited the large room of the Fabra i Coats the current councillor of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president set Trinijov as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Displaced a occupied farm where macrofiestas were held
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street lived has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the illegally occupied property, and where they organized macrofiestas desperate for the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From now on there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The occupants, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building – the rest are inhabited – took away the entire electrical installation and part of that of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted for up to two days and were desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate were making him unfair competition, as they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the amusement park had to respond to neighbouring noise complaints, while, according to her, the inconveniences are not caused by the guests of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity according to the zones in recent weeks.
The head of the discotheque explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that she "forgives" the rent.
The City Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had last week demanded "immediately remove the property to end the problems of coexistence and civilisation that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one occupied floor of the building, but over the past few months the occupiers had been entering all floors of the building and almost all floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be strong against the incivism that has been generated on the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police headed to 35 Mont-ral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
The park or the mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some Pasquins of Collserola promotion.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper boundary of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few who are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -below (sea).
The rating of Collserola as a natural park redundant in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the pigs in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the town hall convened a mega competition consisting of 16 competitions for so many other gates to access Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both in its purely organisational aspect and in its reflection on the city, is the subject of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to hand when two members of this former caste of elected officials are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, have said.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB2>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after approaching the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerd<0xC3><0xA0>, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It can be based on the fact that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect said, for whom the title of "Portas de Collserola" encloses a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action must be taken".
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an “intellectual challenge” with “some dangers”.
Dangers deriving from the "uncertainty that it is today to project public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of some borders on where it can be built.
“Limiting something is fixing the next step,” that is, its overstep.
“We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters.”
More focused on the question, M<0xC3><0xB2>dol thinks that, simplifying, the valley slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a merely topographic issue.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he thanks the city council for the opportunity to intervene in this project "from the very beginning".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the salvo conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this technical profile should be led by the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should only be a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because at the base of the contest a global view of Collserola is missing: "16 cross-sectional contests have been convened - says- in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may collide in program and definition with that of the next door architect.
In his view, yes, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, to its full extent, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and will be released
After 72 days of rooting, Casino Red’s legal clerk granted forgiveness to Monterrey’s mayor’s brother for the trial that was followed for alleged blackmail.
After remaining 72 days in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after Casino Red’s legal accomplice granted him pardon before the District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail lawsuit against Monterrey’s brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a released a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the regional council to allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
Following the public denunciation, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the mayor’s brother and on September 2 he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours in the presence of the Public Prosecutor's Office Agent 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
There, he remained for 49 days after a second order of entrenchment was issued after the Public Prosecutor ' s agent discarded the crimes of cohabitation and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penalty purportedly for blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he only stayed a few hours in the median security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internment trial in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, enough evidence was found to determine Jonas’s guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to allow my representatives to operate from the gambling house.
On Monday, Casino Red’s legal master, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, approached Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the mayor’s brother; so he could regain his freedom in the next few hours.
During the legal due diligence, the prosecutor’s agent assigned to the court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the betting house’s partners granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011 the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and thereafter no claim can be filed about the process that was followed him; besides that he will not be required to repair damages or punishment.
After the hearing to the legal possession of the betting house, at about 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
He will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the thrown results on the accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to land.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations done in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The helicopter's design was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to carry passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30-degree inclination.
For the time being, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the research can take several months, it could even reach a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that this happened on an upward soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical norms the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions: <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
Reports in the AICM located suitable conditions for take-off, as the aircraft progressed towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico were presenting low-altitude clouds.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew has sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sided trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of aircraft debris makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the disaster there is still no evidence revealed on the remains of the ship of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disarticulated along said path.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the co-ordinated site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Leads Social Security Research to Discover the Gene of Obesity in Children and Young People; Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the protocol ‘Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity’, which will allow you to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research it is invited to participate to the population, whether or not they have rights, to go to the participating sports units of IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests to the minors are carried out, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He noted that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Penn State of Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (Eastern State of Mexico).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
At World Diabetes Day on 14 November, she said the goal was to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (it seeks to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys noted that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed," the IMSS specialist noted.
He pointed out that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which allows them to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) on the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of having metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors hand it over in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is a lack of daily physical activity, staying in front of the TV for most of the day and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (sizes, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would avoid basins
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 baht each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM.
In his lecture A technological view of the baches, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in his charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve their performance and therefore the formation of basins.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, one of high molecular weight, called asphalts, and the other of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By passing the vehicles and generating effort, this allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, abundant, is placed a last layer called rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the rims of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction along the way.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the effort, the rolling folder also requires to have the right thickness and the material from which it is made must be cared for.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is moistened, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all layers of the pavement and thus the formation of clogs.
In the process of forming a bache, he said, the first to wear is the bearing film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The National System of Investigators also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, in order to prevent the formation of bumps frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair the basins easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did Valle’s candidate lack to be the new Colombian lady?
Analysis of the factors that impacted for Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to reach the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Again the Cauca Valley remains with the wishes of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to agree to be on the podium of winners, to look like the silver crown and the band that credited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1999), Is (1989), Isabella (1989), Is), Is, and Is), Isabella (1999)
Today, the big question that many people ask themselves is What was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that got queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Literary Career Leamos.
When asked, the caucasian replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way to culture, I definitely think that the book that marked me from childhood is “The Prince”, it’s a pretty deep book.
I currently read “Crime and Punishment” is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called “The Burning of Blood”.”
A response that he disliked firstly for the term “cultured” and secondly for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited has marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little bit, "The Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched it is said that Valle was burned by favouritism.
A Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovarian and the candidate who carried all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best craftsman costume, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on it."
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both looked safe, it was noted that he lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN Channel's "Como En Casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was named a princess "verifies that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not stay as queen."
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For something, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to her father’s social needs.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because it was the jury who chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens trainer Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noteworthy, dropped her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the Vallecaucacana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her stronghold and here she was charged.”
For this prize, which for the first time gave the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in bathing suit came a cruel Vatican that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the dispute that Raymundo granted to Melina in order not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that from today Melina begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international events by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her winding passage through Cartagena, was eluded by the crown.
This was the work of the calene who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali lophoscopist passed on history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a CTI lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top head of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", through the scanning of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the ICC section, that week was the turn of “availability” to Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in Choc<0xC3><0xB3> municipalities, where he often had to intern for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano a Eliasar was warned to wear a minimum of three days of clothing.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Caucasus in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man leading the world’s oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to carry Guillermo Leon S<0xC3><0xA1>enz’s decadactile card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it for its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Elijah compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not fail: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was indeed the highest head of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali fingerprinter, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Aside from identifying bodies, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals either present fake bills or have no papers.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The investigator said that in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of a wall from a house, for there the thief had supported his hand to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the whole handprint and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,” he recalled.
Footprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man with liquor bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in the objects "the fingerprints are taken out with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registrar.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” said the CTI expert.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown on the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quotation is made.
The "indignants" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters marched in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part responded to the eviction order and moved to a nearby parish.
The Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by attempting to re-enter, under the auspices of a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and by attempting to occupy another Greater Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the "angry" to camp again on the spot, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where new arrests have been made.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations,” said one of the spokespersons of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the "angry" response to the eviction of his camp dictated personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the "indignants" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
They managed to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while reassuring Efe that he saw several journalists who were also bullied.
The organization said several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already moved in support of the movement’s members and had sought to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square – which is a private property site – is still closed pending the holding of a court order scheduled for the same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation this morning should be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators moved there were carrying and handing out at this time copies of that court order and even handing them over to the agents guarding the square, sparking “small clashes,” Bray said, who denounced that some officers gave blows to the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entrying the park with shops or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the early-morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which around 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
“This morning’s eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of U.S. workers than those of U.S. workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “lacking respect for freedom of expression.”
The Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two-month protests that began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special TV Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", niece of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
CTV's private television channel announced today that Anderson, along with "crown" (baller) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 giving birth to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread internet distribution of a homemade pornographic video in which he appears along with his then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a grove a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV’s Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and that is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "darkhead" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster Japan has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Tokyo Government amounted to $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have attenuated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the GDP data between July and September served to turn a page, definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also implies the highest growth rate from the period January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the upsurge in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas affected by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the true revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian drive that invites us to take advantage of the crises to strengthen – or rebuild – infrastructure, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable scaled by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and the turbulent U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slate on exporting companies' accounts.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, pinned their weak results between July and September to the yen quotation.
As markets continue their siege to the EU’s peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not take the stand.
“We need to be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s flooding and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy has highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
As it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, when it fell eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is re-fueling the doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums fired and uncertainty reinstalled in parks, Greece continues to entangle in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Hellenic transitional government is being imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed on in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that new feignment will not support new measures of austerity, and in no case his austerity.
“The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit,” Papadimos said in opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear any doubts about his stance: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 billion Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not give his sights to any letter of commitment to complying with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still alarmed by the impact of Papandreou’s referendum order, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign “a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible.”
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what it takes to pay the sixth installment" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date either.
Greek maize still has thread for mouse.
Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a predominant place globally in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" noted that it lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by the 2015 horizon, and, "very especially, with people who are in a lower volume, in the one who has the goal of the reduction of the mita."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", noted Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the most important ones."
There are “many achievements” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is presented not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of those households will come out of the poverty line they are under.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path pioneered years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighting Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in all I have been able to observe the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in the "pobbre de Valladolid parte".
Finally, Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez said that microcredits are “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradication of poverty,” and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom all close the doors"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its gates of contagion."
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without much difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the government’s policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that was won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, “the time has come to pave the way in Europe.”
This could be manifested in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly agree on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank’s directive based on the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany’s weight.
Looking forward to calming the mood inside her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Recalling that two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The Incidence of Fraud in Disease Benefits
Following the subsidy, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the issue, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminiscent of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sickness casualties.
Firstly, to apply budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of deprivation on private sector workers before they can take the plunge.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
It is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of unpaid deprivation in the event of a low workload (so far, they are not deficient, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority also re-emphasizes the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuses of low-income jobs.
“Controls are going to be significantly increased and, moreover, if someone is found to be committing a fraud, they will have to refund the amounts,” Bertrand said in a speech on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of jobless fraud.
In fact, this issue has been constantly being monitored since 2002, and a number of policy offensives have been launched which have normally resulted.
The French are sicker than in the rest of Europe.
Let us look closely, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million was paid in 2006 for underemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for lows accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this, 46% corresponds to maternity and work accident losses, while 54% is related to sickness losses, a figure of 6.2 billion euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off for illness.
Another study, in this case of Assurance disease, indicates that in 2010, 37% of the disease cases lasted less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% were longer.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to get sick.
A long 2010 study by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall unemployment rate (both for health and other reasons) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The low-income fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term losses were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of losses of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "appropriately adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total departure of 1.2 million, amounted to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a fall due to illness.
Undoubtedly a negligible figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, that is, more than the total cost of low subsidies and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in this latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared on Monday, November 14, before Parliament; he also added that the hundred days granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"In order to make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," the head of government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday, said.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on October 27 will be the “main task” of the new government, as the country’s stay in the eurozone is “at stake,” he added.
Consequently, Papademos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 percent in 2010 and 15.7 percent in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
He noted that he agreed with the deficit and debt reduction targets, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of the preamble.
Experts say euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live by denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by denial of death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an imposing Royal Society of Canada report, which included the participation of six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed, when the patient is considering such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is recorded in Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e., the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide have not consented to them with non-competent persons.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.”
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is about to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that no trial should be initiated against them.
Regarding the maintenance or interruption of a patient’s health care, the situation is not as clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, his recommendations suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect the fact that a patient refuses attendance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts have expressed reservations.
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of experts signing the report as “extreme” because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted yesterday with a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also pointed out that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
Now, he adds, “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she called a "manifest in favor of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, is suing especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President Assad to abandon power
Damascus denounces “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Foreign Ministry building yesterday.
Yesterday intensified the diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, have voiced support for President Assad’s abandonment of power.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
“If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime.”
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" regarding repression in Syria, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already lost their lives in southern Syria’s Deraa region, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died “during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was “advancing towards the end of the crisis.”
In addition, it has reacted firmly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damasco from its functions, which in its opinion constitutes a “dangerous step”.
Syria “will not flare up,” he added, guaranteeing that “the plots against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also voiced his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression that he believes is enclosed in “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary League meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to prepare for the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detainees.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League’s decision was “incorrect” yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked some time for the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include “victims” aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today met with the unions and the employer.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti has spoken of a broad program with numerous sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the designated Council President.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation, by Mr. Monti, of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are certain deadlines” to form a government and prepare its program, he said, adding that he is “certain that markets will have patience and understand it.”
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then there was concern, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should operate until 2013, the date of the next legislatures, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the goal of Italy "recovering its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for the adoption of new rigor measures.
The Italian "head of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him as the mate, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can not meet the requirements in terms of deficit."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) draws on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The IAEA expressed its “serious concern” last week over a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
His company’s economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to a Member State reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in the military nuclear program of his country."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to those figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14% overall increase in the number of anti-Semitic people.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these kinds of crimes and crimes have increased again,” Human Rights First said, “the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, head of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “crime of hate” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter modified its platform presentation on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, causing its service to look a bit more like Facebook.
A new “activity” tab and another so-called “name” allow us to more legibly and lively track the activity of other “Twitters”, i.e. those Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) remain on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they qualify as favorites any messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested “with a small percentage of users in August” before it was released to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its poco instinctivo functionimento, con terminmens ligemente esotericos (RT to resend a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) doing the happiness of initiates, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the large public networks Facebook and Google<0x2B>.
On the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation with different opinions at the stroke of "tweets".
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” he wrote.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream,” writes <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a Budgetary "Golden Rule" in the Constitution
The government of Austria’s ruling Social Democratic/Democratic coalition has decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary “golden rule” to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria’s sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure far above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by one level, from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democratic Vice Chancellor for Foreign Affairs.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal state’s structural government deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historic highs that produced the Japanese authorities’ intervention on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yens for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider it a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was quoted again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic 105 yen bar, reaching levels close to those triggered by the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago, as it increases Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when converting them into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda noted, who fears that the intensification of the yen cuts off the weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan’s “economic bases.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no greater monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion), bringing to 55 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the threshold of funds dedicated to the acquisition of various liquid financial securities to flood the market.
Euro area:
The rates are growing, the bags are weakening.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stock exchanges are sinking a little further in the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions in relation to the yields of the most affected eurozone countries, the stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing concerns from market players about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look at Europe and the exchanges will continue to take place at a reduced margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The re-emergence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that foresees, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates exceeded by 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds on the same period offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the southern countries, but also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Expecting growth figures for the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a figure more favourable than expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts are worth more than dogmas.
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it looks at the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a need to alleviate the growing shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case either of Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or of Switzerland, which is solely aiming to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependency due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal power plants.
Within a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
We need to think about the case of Denmark.
Europe’s champion in the wind sector, of which it obtains 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not in principle object to such energy, polls show.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets that can create non-local jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of much of those SMEs and the loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is scheduled to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and cooperation between the security authorities, and French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all the electric players who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them the free way to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the partisan emotions, dogmas and maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Interior Minister (see the May 23, Libération newspaper) declaring in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters."
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone set Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limited himself to including banalities, indicating that the co-development will allow to solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the experts on immigration.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for domestic workers and mainly work in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
In light of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows means a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity provided by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the International Labour Organization estimates that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income less expenses) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little, that it was something thought.
Although universal suffrage is a necessary condition for democracy, it is not enough on its own and can even become an “instrument of oppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inconsistency.
We need to think about this ambivalence in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take blows, but a common exercise, of full law, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that folds to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, and the one that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regains the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal of the Socialists and of Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
May it be so.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would take us to a new dead end.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
An interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European people's sovereignty, can this be achieved.
To build Europe, let's make Europe.
Cards with "contactless" chips become generalized
The world chip card show starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for shared transportation or purchases by simply approaching the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is projected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and account for about 10% of the global market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To put the upper gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminate contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Mobile Phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for carrying out transactions.
“They are lagging behind.”
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect 80 to 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
Banks are taking the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
“The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show they are cooperating,” he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially caught the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we should definitely wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys foreign financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and styled Kamikazes or explosive devices used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pushing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, been considering the group as a community of illumined people of little interest for some time.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, "Western education is a sin"), instigates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people died.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, is sentenced to death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern feuds.
The past Christmas, claims one attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram re-attacked Abuya, particularly the police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is alarming to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Shebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, with Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A America weakened by the crisis, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think that it is.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making increasingly strident foreign policy statements and shortcuts, traditionally a Republican stronghold.
There are slogans, often unfounded, about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the “Grand Old Party,” has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them “for manipulation of their currency,” a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “applauds” emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter China’s military threat because Beijing is “attempting to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of Iraq’s “boys” and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy.
The people judge in a rather positive way Obama’s national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to revive his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestral music and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the Russian gas entry into Western Europe’s network.
With this new gas pipeline, every year 27.5 million cubic meters of additional Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe through a first 1,224-kilometer tunnel that connects the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012, which will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be supplied, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, we are already talking about the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic States had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the land flow by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
At one point, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of energy Europe, given that the project has generated a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to bring its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves, to success.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically,” Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom’s executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to end measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as much as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was envisaged in Swedish waters, but the project leaders resigned when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company to permanently settle at sea off its coast.
“In case of failure, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have predicted joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without the need for any kind of repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is especially favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, the full gas transport capacity.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline has been completed in 30% with the contribution of shareholders and in 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the construction is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the exit gate of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
The total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aging by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch to the market a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, at the time the company’s consultant, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the soft skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed, has remained far from it.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its inception, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom in emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of Disabled Persons begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among people with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Desensitizer?
“No,” says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
“The progress made over the last 15 years is considerable.
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It should be noted that disabled people continue to face numerous barriers to accessing employment.
They usually have an older age: 37% are over 50 years old (on average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed their bachelor’s degree and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the working world and that “constitute the quid of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people’s mindset advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprenre association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed have “a low level of knowledge about disabilities,” with “excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities.”
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set out in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“We now reach around 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59.000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
Coming up against the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly game gives them.
We will not dare to say that there was consistency between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the staircase of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his frontman’s resentment against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's frontman replies.
As for the contrast between your presentations on your team and in the selection, "it's a set," it has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
“I have to sit down.”
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brilliant".
Not to mention the “pleasure.”
He has been animating the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan of him,” he said.
This will certainly reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face “the Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has for his part referred to "pride".
"Pride" for competing "a gala match".
"Proud" also to check, as "neighbor", that France "returns to a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a great job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the upcoming European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You can see him in the upcoming matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal has a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal is facing great optimism at the return game against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-way game, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and in Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Cup.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is one game to play and one rival, Bosnia, to beat.
Taking into account the one-on-one (0-0) game on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house."
But at home, in the luminous Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it turns out that the party "is very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect the match to be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the 2012 European Cup," Carlos Queiroz's successor, Carlos Queiroz, said in a statement.
Friday’s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a tie, but they also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored out of the house,” Bento laments.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "leave them no time to think".
It’s a good idea, as long as it’s realistic this time.
