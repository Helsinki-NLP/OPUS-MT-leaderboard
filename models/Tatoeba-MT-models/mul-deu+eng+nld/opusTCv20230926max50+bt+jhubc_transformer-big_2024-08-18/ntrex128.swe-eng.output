AM in Wales is worried about "coming out as puppet"
Some members of the Welsh Parliament are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
The entire political spectrum is concerned about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can’t speak Welsh: Twp means dumb in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative Welshman said his group was "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh as the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation for the name change, said: "The final decision on what to call members of the assembly is so clear up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
The current title for AM was proposed by the Commission by Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM obviously proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus could cause problems for Presidential Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
They are allowed to vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonia holds a referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said he will ignore the result.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's silent when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
“Older people I’m talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before,” Adams said.
"Now there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are interacting in different ways these days,” he said.
"Bars are no longer like the area's living room, where people go on a regular basis."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders expect and that "they will sooner or later end up on route one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner-occupied apartments filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to all churches being closed, as those who move into the apartments will probably not be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or transport black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the bell game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the clock game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first clock game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of recent months at St. Martin’s are a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs – some hired by the church’s laymen, others by the Episcopal Foundation.
The church council — the governing body of the church consisting of laymen — wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark Hurts 13-Year-Old Who Dives for Hummers in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who died after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that the entire keybone had been worn up.
“I called everyone to get out of the water. ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” said Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is said to be critical.
It is not clear what kind of shark it was.
Swim guard Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with store-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fashion and household market falling, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s attempt to fill the shelves that were previously taken up by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s said they plan to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with marked areas, such as in stores such as Boots.
The chain is also relaunching its boutique makeup brand so that most of the products are vegan – which more and more young customers demand.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test the condition in two Sainsbury’s stores – the first one opened in Croydon, South London last week and the second one opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like department stores in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has Argos status in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat statuses since they bought both chains two years ago, which they say has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute over how the revenues from Boot's grocery sales would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care products, including brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial manager, said: “We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an appealing environment in convenient locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'short' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is “serious” about TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulling out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not match their brand Truly, with leisure clothing and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative last-minute lifestyle brand – to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “rassing” at an exciting meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand, Truey, and casual wear.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her vacation homes.
A source said: “Truthy was clearly Holly’s top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave shocked everyone who was involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe the decision by the This Morning presenter to withdraw could cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and lights to clothing, as well as the risk of further delays of launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business.”
Tough snack "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for being so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a "news anchor voice":
"I haven't given up on anything."
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear armament have been stalled.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” from the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament step.
He noted that instead the United States continues sanctions intended to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results – an end to rocket tests, liberated hostages and returned remains of U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had lost their homes, it was not declared a state of emergency, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates the whole thing," Ms Sumbung said.
Rescue the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the Office for Natural Disasters, said Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning being issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and railroads.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr Joko is also being pushed by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge cleared last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the far pole.
The attempt flew high above the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hopes and ended up in the net.
“I just tried to get in a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think so much about it but just kicked."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker hauled a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinning off the close midfield and sprinting to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a superb kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far post with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are playing against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the rubble of buildings that rushed into the 7.5 earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of rushes from buildings that rushed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything to show up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in an early stage of the investigation, but I am asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera, to contact us because they may have information crucial to our investigation.”
A spokesperson for the police has confirmed that the woman who was found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police inform the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but police said no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was disillusioned when he found out what had happened.
Residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours for them to enter again.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says, "It's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are asked to send a DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 as of September 30.
Parliament statue of Cromwell latest victim of controversy over rewrite of history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "dumbness" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be dragged into the ongoing debate about removing statues.”
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell's mistake might have been sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th-century view of and is part of the historiography of a man whom many believe should still be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from the outside, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is a correct representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly influenced the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and celebrated.
Killer Pigs Kill Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a bruised artery and covered in blood in a trail on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccine into pigs in a swine fever on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby piggy bank was open.
He said there was a big pig in the piggy bank with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and twisted,” the cousin, identified with the surname Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in order to avoid further attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig stuck a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They are just playful.
They're naive, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rainfall in southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels across cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five o’clock EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trench begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and travels east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Pink will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture interacting with the impending trough will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mudslides and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5–10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread tropical rainfall.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out in the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around the sand.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and halo roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some shiny tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics stay warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost a ten-degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm start in October with around 30 degrees from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interview
More than 20 million watched Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday’s last minute twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flakes’ deal with the FBI where they had a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh tapped her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said that he is absolutely sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from the office.
In comparison, there are as many spectators as for a football match in the final game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second highest number of viewers with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was in the spotlight during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes as the protesters shouted at him, which was shown live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The television networks broadcast live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether they would pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he only intended to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political play' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely unreasonable.”
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost their glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interviewing Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish court released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police's evacuation force, the state law enforcement lab, the Southern University police and residents of the area for assisting with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flight and pursuit of justice".
The Sims were 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “shocked” and “shocked” by Wayne’s death.
“You’re worried about this all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mules and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which stands 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police unite with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with law enforcement while thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by demand police threw eggs and powdered paint on them, resulting in dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles broke out later in the day, and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local media.
The mood is still tense in the region that yearns for independence a year after the referendum on October 1, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low as the majority who opposed the secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at state stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcis Termes, took part in the separatist protests with his wife and said he no longer believes Catalonia will become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy over being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are for independence have had a hard time keeping the momentum up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in prison awaiting trial for their self-declaration of their role in the organization of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his mobile phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more exciting,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned since the end of last year, announced that he intends to run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the undermining we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car drives into house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was repeatedly driven into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Superintendent Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armrest may have also been fired at the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s side has still not won a away win in the Premiership this season and will face Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning streak to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross-beamers
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they made goals; their fairness gave the Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nicking across the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that was how the decisive goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the center of the goal area.
At that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impermeable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left alone.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two penalties – after Halket’s challenge by interchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honor of galvanizing the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilfully organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on full swing straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn’t hold the measure – they only opened the homepage once – and it’s something of a wake-up call for the Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) the leaders of Turkey and Germany had their breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become unfamiliar with human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police said they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duelling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and condemned as a unilateral ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-traffic road in Deptford in south-east London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurse was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a contagion accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they are trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been rerouted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in riots
Six prison guards have been injured in riots at a men’s high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated in place for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those behind this will be brought to the police and may face extended prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the law enforcement was called to prison to deal with serious unrest where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas of drought may benefit)
Tropical low pressures are rare to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s residual energy pulls out over the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5–10 cm of rainfall, with insulated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very severe, but some of the rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, calming it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can receive heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The biggest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in southwestern United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening floods and mudflows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the cell phone to show up.
Trump Says Kavanaugh “Lead, Evil, Anger” from Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s recklessness and outrageous tactics,” Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the malice, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his indictment.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal senses of our time, a lawyer with a prime history of serving the public,” he told his supporters in the audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I am not running, but I am running,” he said.
“That’s why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were trying to “resist and stop.”
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six-metre-high waves crashed against the beach in the twilight, sweeping many to a safe death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away from it, and they fell victim to the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency BNPB, told a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone but towed cars, stockpiles and houses. It hit everything in its way," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had traveled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluation and application of technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in Friday’s huge earthquake was 200 times as large as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "comprehensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the sudden collapse of buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is heard screaming frenzied warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes to the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive power outage that disrupted all communications around Palu, making rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for auxiliary work and will remain closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have gone to Palu, where they seek shelter during shelters on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have started the urgent aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if a state of emergency is declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been announced.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would turn out to be the miracles that lit up dark natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who was stranded for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national screen flight team coach, had trained two of the missing screen planes for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a screen-flying veteran, I have my own sensitive burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon said hours after the screen planes heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent desperately WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages received only one grey buck, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink’s co-worker who was filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, criminal Dennis McCarthy said in the message.
While he was busy, "another man jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the perpetrator's identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, saying: "The brand that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change of name comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set for "emotional reasons" according to the creators of the program.
Ye is an abbreviation of West’s current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the word used most in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who has changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without strings and verses.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians now as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired weapons at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, even though the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double-budget could double the chance of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies – Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked U.S. Othello player, and later served as CEO of Google's China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to be able to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading university personalities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies can also help the United States with AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants people at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donate money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has made no progress in months.
Macedonian referendum on renaming
Macedonia's people voted Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has hampered the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50 percent required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is as follows: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth renaming if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, able to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority of parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary election when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko vote in the Macedonian referendum on the country’s name change, which would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and set up chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with the head in the air, not sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a NATO membership would lead to much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80 percent of our residents are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Survey, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought to vote in the referendum, which falls below the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of participants thought to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them voted yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50 percent of registered voters plus one vote must be counted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-oriented government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton's defenses to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and set out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He turned around one defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the goal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We were talking about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made goals at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's reins on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it came out of reach.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competitive Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who are a match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance for the final.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
“We’re playing for nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I’d meet this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
The Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports they are reluctant to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-hand thrower is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I don’t run, but I run. That’s why I go around and fight for the sovereign candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see a terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever is needed, you see their wickedness, their horror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to “resist and prevent.”
“You’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and ugly and terrible and false.”
He mentioned the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was voiced by high-ranking viewers.
"Don't you remember what she said?
“Did you leave the document?”
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who will hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar topics Jeremy criticized previous leaders for.
The announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of “more friendly, more careful” policy has been forgotten long ago, if it ever even began.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated within the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party’s leaders accept it.
This started right after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, as I previously thought, had a similar political view that I expected me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – a tirade of ignorance on social media follows that demands that I be deposed, criticizes my politics and says that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day, but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this era of politics is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church and with every distrust and change in the rules of selection, the party is getting tighter.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too far ahead, so “it’s okay.”
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher’s government’s neglect that literally made my elementary school classroom collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, and that includes the recent election.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted Friday’s appeal, I just want to say that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat to depose me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unattached Ayr on top
Two last-minute attempts may have distorted the result a bit, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this delightfully entertaining Tennet’s Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested during our matches so far and are still undefeated, so we’re so obviously happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Air deserve it, they took better chances than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, let Melrose speak the numbers and Jason Baggot made an inverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the plan, and after the restart Ayr again increased the management with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line out behind Ayr's mull.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still, Game star Ford Kiernan appears ready to enter the restaurant industry after it is discovered that he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol a rigged headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have an ocean blue flag.
The fleet’s bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still strong – and it is also the longing to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than in several decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the drive, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and so clearly expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decisions of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court in The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court is adjudicating in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change much even if it did.
The Court of Justice of the United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to allocate Chilean territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments suggest that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have harmed rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She argues that Morales' aggressive rhetoric has solidified Chile's remaining well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the court’s decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of divergences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the question of the sea as a political crusade.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move forward from the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Requires Trust in U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resolving the death of the nuclear weapons diplomat more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “wishful dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. protests against a statement to end the Korean War will ever tame North Korea.
Washington is hesitant to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to get rid of an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal Latest Line Huge Headwear on the Road to Shops Near You
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of crispy, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the style icons of Paris fashion week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat tray that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat and even a pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored worms had skin-stained lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet suit with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass straw.
And if you continue that enormous courage, you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come just after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm velvet that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another big creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held in it.
The terracotta raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Determining Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic performance and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, which are only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sports, art, music and other community engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement customized curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final exam Higher Grade.
Data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject choice are now considered as important as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics at curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17% attributable to a lack of language skills.
With that said, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent responded that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
This is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland, each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered to be most important for the UK before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly languages that continue to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as "international communication ability".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s first game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The number of minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Laker's official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five planned appearances over the next week, including events at venues he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a confirmation vote of his candidate for the vacant post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress ahead of the upcoming November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00 tonight on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week’s interrogation by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained by accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation into the case is underway.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November election.
President Trump said these five meetings next week are aimed at “engaging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesperson who did not want to be named told Reuters.
The night’s events, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw in fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has slipped behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to get there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a statesman at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hope alive for Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s pairings could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a fully invented sports concept, but something players really believe in, and more than ever before, in competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum I guess," Jordan Spieth said when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the sail, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been vass from tee to green and precedes with a good example.
The win streak went even higher as his round continued and he lowered a crucial putt to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had lagged behind with two after two games.
His putt that won them the match at 15 met with a similar foul, with the conviction that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's undeniable story.
Europe’s odd but adorable couples are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not doing a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and audience reactions state that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home to a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victories.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole that they never even came close to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely due to the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a significant lead before the last day, but this four-season also showed that Team USA has a battlefield that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe take the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage at the Ryder Cup on the last day after coming out of Saturday's foursomes match with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a defeated Tiger Woods and came home four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, which fought to keep the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really started during the morning four-ball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but that was not enough for victory.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed evidence of occasional moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning four-ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked 1st and 3rd in the world.
Europe did not have wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American benchmark with two points on Saturday.
They came home with 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has come back from a four-point understatement in the singles, however, Furyk's side only needs an undefeated result to keep the cup.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack can be hard to get through.
North Korea Says They Will “Never” Disarm Unilaterally Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant steps in the past year to show its goodwill,” for example by stopping nuclear weapons and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
“We don’t see any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a nuclear approach divided into stages that would lead to North Korea’s reward when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a one-sided nuclear-weapon solution as such.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards "development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused negotiations to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on “decommissioning first” and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even opposes the “declaration of ending the war,” Ri says.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream for those people who lack knowledge about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a dead end."
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s future ability to reach the US mainland with missiles was inevitable after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, gave praise to Kim for his courage to take action on disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying that "whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the maintenance of the Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made; however, North Korea accused him of making “procedural demands” a few hours later.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and even a nuclear power plant if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and are moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Rarity students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has got all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled “highs.”
One academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often careless when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why can’t I know this until now, during my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course covers a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to find out about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture in that "dignity" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all PhD students to complete a similar study programme before they begin their studies at the high-performing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the clock, leading to problems with the lighting.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal lowers Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home their first win on the road since February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a manager to leave his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga beat to seven minutes before half time and the Rangers never managed to equalize the result.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more trouble for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-killed game surpassed opponents each time.
The Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the match when Menga's first pass passed through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A free kick in the depths from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear post.
The Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their game during the final third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a home kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livi's opening shot in the 34th minute may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their knight deserved it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's fixed situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outsider hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett waving up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed well to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nicked outside around the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was tapped with the Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the mannequin called Geiger Meters.
Geiger meters have become a cornerstone of science ever since, and also feature prominently in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Meter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to "See" Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-inject
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a staggering performance in which he lauded U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he ran against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the play was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to run West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headband.
“They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I dropped low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to sink low too?" and said that he would "put my supermanscape on, because that means you can't say what I'm allowed to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Test it with love.”
His comments attracted more booze at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said: "There was death row in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his appearance of the song I Love It, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STUDYING YOU WITH THE MOBB."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) that I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are with them, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's colleague, Snoop Dogg, has called himself the Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after knife-cutting at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendants are expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-turning role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "very strong" to deal with the problem.
“I personally feel pretty strong right now – where have we gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He continued, “What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife thanks to the series, so that’s how it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in whom Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an acute issue in China’s HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many cases of infection are due to insufficient protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking GOP senator's duties, citing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies, and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released contained home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released information about a member of Water's staff, Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Water’s statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is outrageous,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They shall not question the motives of the respondent.
They have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to depose Waters in the middle of the term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Stort to true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned “appropriate authorities and the essence of the crime-fighting for these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with British inclination, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy – a series of spy parodies that were kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will there be satire about how obviously bad we are to become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been granted his license to renew Klanta for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for the bio audience even in non-English speaking countries.
He is of course the tight-knit secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a snail Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly struck his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy appears, but the humor feels rather low-key and strangely superfluous, especially since the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it’s adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is weird, not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film brothers in the role of Bean.
The constant topic is now that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all of Britain’s agents out in the field, to the agent in the great discontent of service – an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the ancestral Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any well-off institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine creator, a jolly hockey sticks role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and bump into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister will fall for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problem: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farsighted moves: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle aboard Volta’s luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta’s hus.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Quite moderately everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for Brits to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a radical plan that involves the British working a four-day week - but getting paid for five.
The party wants corporate leaders to hand over the savings made by the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but retaining the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda in favor of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits into the party’s stance to balance the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Greens party that promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not the party’s policy and it’s not something the party agrees on.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless leaders” and “smugglers” of state-owned companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get their full stake back, as a Labour government can make “deductions” because of what they perceive to have been incorrect acts.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 percent of the private company’s own capital is transferred to its employees, who then claim annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I entered the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seems bleak.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and that would take a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a hugely impressive array of performing stars and an equally impressive mission; fighting world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to be able to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or otherwise meaningfully contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clickivism” – people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from its supporters who fought for a variety of goals.
It says these measures have helped motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the accumulated assets so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and stakeholders committed to “helping children develop to their full potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the area.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history," partnership ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken that require the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website: “What makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty?”
Responding to the Global Citizen: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use its fleet in a “blocked” to block Russian energy exports
The government can "if necessary" use its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – particularly where it appears to be at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to utilise and replace the fuel,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “day country” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements will come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s resistance to the project is driven only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly dislike that a third party interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a “ordinary thinker” if she is to stand up in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take an "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the U.S. presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will take a real thinker to run for president.”
Warren weighs in on President Donald Trump during the city hall meeting and said he "takes this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been fluent in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not think she would run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through now that he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they will come back like other people, they will come back hardened, they will come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempts to prevent a report on domestic violence and intoxicated gun possession, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the lover in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
States lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems of gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by immigration authorities that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances that the claim applies, and such a provision contravenes that principle,” according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “delivery the necessary labor.”
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered asylum-seekers to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation seemed increasingly grim.
"It feels very exciting," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who consoled her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a waste.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooting through water-damaged properties and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were injured in the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continued severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We don't run away.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Mobbing’ with ‘Propaganda’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily paying a surcharge in the Des Moines Register — the state of Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S. 6th congressional election, something China denies.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with elevated tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government is using America’s beloved tradition of free speech and a free press to spread the propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economy, because the media is controlled by iron hands by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers denied the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters in mid-term elections through Kavanaugh fiasco, analyst warns
As many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh facing multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned there will be a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming election.
The sentiments around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
You can’t turn back the clock,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s final attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, DC newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, they chanted demonstrative “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building when Republicans who control the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the ceiling,” Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undetermined female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony of allegations of sexual assault against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
“This has become a confusing mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh comes through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, told the news channel.
But Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they most believe in.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations Ford has made, as well as those from at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed her genitals while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “world dominance.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring in the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of software developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on top over the course of one night.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has in recent months been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this new era on the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a bullet four days later and was never told that he had been awarded the most prestigious award of the British military.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the award.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led the line forward with "great courage" before deciding the battle alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble about."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feeled very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got to see Greta Gris instead
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night to see the Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet, the British viewers were surprised when the show suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were few impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke."
“It was the government’s decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their scheduling to better include British viewers in the future.
“I think we’ll be able to find a solution to the rebate,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, the program change upset many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “underhanded” due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his peers during his upbringing because of his sexuality – but that also spurred him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he went to high school.”
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show’s regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley tells how he felt "less valued" than others during his upbringing, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, “This feeling of feeling less valued and feeling different has been a real source of the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so that he did not betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for HBT rights and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt he had the luck to be able to live openly without limitations and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said his love of a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” — he participated in his first OS at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole life perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold,” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - where he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him: you won’t be able to sit on the front row daddy,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life – diving in front of a home audience at an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and that still gave him shakes.
Desert Island Discs will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he must fix his shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was beaten by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between acting hip hop and training at his game in the hopes of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long ruffle often misses hard.
It’s not just the course that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who together with novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the front of the 12 singles games have won in the start, Mickelson’s match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has contributed so much to these teams in previous seasons and over the past week.
I didn’t think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he was going to do more, but now it's what it is and we're going to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon be just a memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day’s singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but ultimately won with the lowest possible margin with the result 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds you that we led big at Valderrama, we led big at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with urgency and barely," Bjorn said after seeing 2018's class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we will give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the points on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this cup and that’s where our focus lies.
I’ve said it all the time, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players’ performances on a tough golf course and added: “I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow there will be new challenges.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply and it is a completely different thing.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when you’re doing well, but when you’re out there on your own, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to go and get the best of himself.”
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he quit as a loser when Europe ran "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we would like to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace starts on one side, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We did our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this arrangement because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said of his singles.
Germany's new warships delayed again
The German Navy’s newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, local media reported.
The deployment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the launch ship for the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were devastated for the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air defense and naval missiles, as well as some lubrication techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships – which allow Germany to project power abroad – are already outdated when they are put into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It also emerged that the ship has a significant overweight, leading to deterioration in performance and limiting the Navy’s ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project price tag - including training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet is actually "starting to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said that this was a growing problem, as old ships were being dismantled but no replacement ships were being provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flesh Mouse
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow southern and dwarf pistols as well as brown long-tailed and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat noise and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of environmental management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain forested areas for bats and other related species.
Fledermaus populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the well-being and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from household cats.
Fleas aren’t blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to find insects and obstacles in their airway.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, review bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Thraave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
“Here at Thraave we have a good area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a host of favorable living environments.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before carrying out maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single home could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly annihilate an entire population.
Flatter mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or destroy their bone.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations feel.”
Ronaldo rejects rape conviction while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "fake news" and says people "want to market themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No, not the most.
What they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is good,” said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount equal to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayal of the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she was "afraid of retribution" and was worried about "being humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the conciliation as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' to lose car makers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "unfortunate" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily cease production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no contract termination could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is powered on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, it could lead to border disruptions that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s consumption in stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and as a result, production would be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's program Today.
“The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed in another week” as the fight against Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia, and the president’s potential impediment to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s crackdown for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying interception equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at UN Headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee hearings where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been fixed, it could happen this week, or a one-week delay in view of all the other things happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to any objection to TV reporters who "play for the gallery," although she said: "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more question sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing evidence, “We’ve looked at these figures.”
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president perhaps showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland in view of Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of decommissioned status applications for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, ahead of decisions expected to come in the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves healthcare work and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half an hour ago.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a litter was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no data on the type/size of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the match, giving him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help the homeless, according to the Tory party’s new plans
The measure aims to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Ministry of Finance expects to earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is added in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and homes purchased for rent, which can be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will attract up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK, which drives prices up and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many well-off areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new release comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on affordable housing to resolve Britain's "needy housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an eye-catching enough proposal for housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to bills without the tenant’s warning.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunities to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream that life will be better for every new generation.
This means resolving the problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and even for companies based abroad, to buy homes that are too hard-working residents of our country.
The dream of owning your home has become just a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scot looks forward to the challenge of bringing life to the club from north-east England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B national team and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club.”
Ross's representatives as coaches for Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a large club. He has previously thanked for offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, I’m assessing success based on the question ‘can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
“This club is absolutely the home of the Premier League, given its structure and talent,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stay as a member of the Hearts training team.
Then he helped Alloa return from relegation to the third division, lifting St Mirren from being close to relegation to becoming a champion the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a road reason," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and could live on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There is a lot to be done every week.
It’s still stress and pressure at work for me, but exercising feels right.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it. I feel better than I’ve ever done in my adult life.”

A survey shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
This summer’s heat wave has meant increased revenues for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from CGA, which has compiled the figures, said: “Continueing beautiful weather and the fact that England stayed in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when pubs grew by 2.8%.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to want to go out and have a drink.
The output of managed pubs and bars increased beverage sales by 6.6% that month, and food sales fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, RSM’s food and entertainment industry analyst, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the big kitchen market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a 4.8% reduction in sales each year is particularly difficult to manage beyond the current cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come any more inappropriate for companies that are run by food sales. Time will tell if the more moderate temperatures that we have had in August give some much-needed respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub and restaurant industry collects and analyzes data on 47 active groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in Five Children Have Secret Social Media Accounts They Hide From Their Parents
One in five children, sometimes as young as 11, have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that there is sexual content posted there
20% of students said they had a “main account” that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Instacons", a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The result has delayed the concern that there is sexual content posted there.
20% of pupils said they have a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
According to the study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted they had private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the board’s annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her broad experience at the international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic golds and is now an expert commentator on the BBC.
He tweeted: “Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!”
Advertisement for breast pumps that compare moms with cows sharing the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused divergences on the internet with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To pay attention to the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with humorous hints to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a head-filled barn with cows to a song with lines like, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and, "If you didn't know that, this is not a Jew, but a bitch."
"Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has faced mixed reactions from viewers, many say it sheds light on the "fashion" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them just a few days after birth,” one person writes.

Another commented: “You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But certainly, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one adds: "What a reality-driven advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
“I think this is ingenious.
I would have gotten one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial that turns to moms who pump (often at the workplace or on the toilet) and feel like 'bags'."
This is not a film that pays tribute to or denounces the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discrete pump clogged in their arms.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or tubes and can be carried discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a co-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and cows, we wanted to shine a light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the hasty rhetoric and harsh policies put in place by the Trump administration, which have made it more difficult to place the children with reference figures.
Previously, most referees themselves have been paperless immigrants, and afraid to put their own opportunities to stay at stake in the country by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Administration, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons for single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known to the law enforcement authorities in the past.
“Nearly 80% of the people who are themselves reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to pursue these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to deal with children’s cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be brought to court within one month of their release, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to the staff at the facilities.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their lawsuit for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to have the right to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are released, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to staff at the facilities and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Advocates say anxiety is rising at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of having a child are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without having enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends, it can aggravate the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally located on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be managed accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said the government in Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the circumstances are good for them to return home, and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that are causing refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They’re politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move on with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement deflected a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and members of the opposition, to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump Will Win a Re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency is terminated prematurely by federal law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely hoping for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there is no sign that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the best broadcasting time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during big news nights.
“This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor,” which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a longtime comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Nell Scovell told me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, Washington’s reporting can determine the future of abortion justice, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen Trump when he suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of strawberry leather for 15,000 dollars.
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he comes with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s rotating cast and daily intrigues.
If you miss a single episode, you end up in the aftermath.
When I spoke to TV producer Mr Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he was sitting and disgusting inside and watching MSNBC while he was recording a broadcast from CNN.
He couldn’t stand it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court’s future lay in the balance.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning to the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever before the midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district receives a lot of money, thanks to a restructuring of a congressional district that has now led two members to compete for the same seat.
This newly encircled suburban district in Pittsburgh is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were constitutionally altered in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding dispute between the major political parties’ economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a broadly guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain advantage.
U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador for China Support but Backed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the shareholders turned the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to call home the heads of the U.S. consignments in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, which would go to drug control and development and provide financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which effectively put a stop to considerations on sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October, which is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three US officials, two of whom were diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next inevitable step may be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged misconduct in court, which there is now tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to stand up in the election again, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to claim that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We must all face different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how far the fight can go.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the unstoppable progress of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he was supposed to have proposed secretly recording the president, and speculated that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
“How will we respond if the FBI investigation requested by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to enter the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections on a congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don’t think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to the U.S., and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the crochet cross.
With that as a legacy, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal, which ended in a draw earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard against greater successes.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
We might have gotten it in the end, but on the whole, it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is going to be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result in their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can definitely move forward and get a good result.
“Last year was very tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well.”
Women sleep poorly because of fear of retirement savings.
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the step and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse/mate and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choices of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a life-insurance hybrid solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with own funds, if you can afford it.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the start.
Establish a health care authority, so that you can appoint a trusted person who oversees your medical care and ensures that the health care staff follows your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are these?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready.”
Several shots fired in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun as he walked home from an evening out.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place at approximately 2:30 a.m., as a "recorded incident".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police urge the witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said. The death toll is expected to rise.
Communications are off, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administrative area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area that stretches over 300 km of the northwestern Sulawesi coast.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy are fisheries and agriculture, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated to Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996, western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the circumpacific seismic fire, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province on northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the nearby city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten metres was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A major earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya administrative area of Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of abuse.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for engaging in a domestic violence report and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su detention and is being held against a $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the KTUU television channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed innocent" when he was asked to give up his stance, according to the television channel.
Palin is suspected of three minor Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a less serious class B crime case, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and death tolls are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Movies showing when it hit is now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors sue for rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are suing the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot building and interiors chain to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He stabbed pedestrians and cyclists in his way in the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both indictments can entail a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was indicted by a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "widespread planning and intent," the prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov carried out it as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnacco damage and loss."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York’s southern district has not been charged in a case demanding the death penalty for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal lawsuit in New York was in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts in the indictment.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "of course disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We consider that the decision to appeal for the death penalty instead of serving life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the defendant finds himself guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s team of defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tories MEP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must “know the heat” of EU skeptics, when one of Theresa May’s own MEPs suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that Britain would have "should have gone out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Theresa May faces when it comes to getting the deeply divided supporters to reconcile has been exacerbated by EU-positive mayors, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under attacks from Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash, forcing EU skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spoil the Chequers deal".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the wheel, we would have been out at this team," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to flush the Chequers deal."
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought a world war to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party also attended the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with the party and with our constituents who are on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Drop the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must be “feel the heat” if they are to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about the trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’”
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Commons mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"It's these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning a “ordinary thinker” to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is going to take a "normal thinker to run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the deputy chairman of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the subject of speculation that she may be taking on Donald Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electorate since Donald Trump's accession.
Someone asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it's time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means a woman at the top."
A person arrested for the shooting of the basketball player Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who was seen in the photos.
The 20-year-old Sims were shot to death near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media on Saturday via the 247 sports news site.
Wayde went in between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to East Baton Rouge police custody.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, playing in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship title after team order gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ team order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung out Hamilton on the dry when he defended his position during the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel took the lead and let Hamilton drive in the back of the clutch, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went on a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free of the risk of bidding on the spot after a double stroke to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the tyres to reach a fast finish and run around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he came in the depot on the 44th lap but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight lap when Raikkonen went up to fourth place.
It’s a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and a second,” Hamilton said.
Very poor body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated as a judge in the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "evil, untrue and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, ugly, ugly and lying," he said.
“You see press releases and leaks and they say, ‘No, I haven’t done it.
I haven't done it.'
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven’t leaked it.”
Wait a minute.
"We've leaked... No, we haven't leaked anything," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't blacked out Ford's allegations, I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted.”
But her dementia doesn't seem to fit the president, who at Saturday night's meeting commented this way: "I'm going to tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continues to support the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by all necessary means.
They don’t care who they are hurting, who they have to run over to gain power and control,” the president told the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars slammed Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants received an early two-goal lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie paid for the home team before Dwyer re-established the management of the Belfast Giants.
Francois Bouchard cleared for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefes, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assists from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford assisted when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who got the receipt at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard scored once again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Flying pilots die because hundreds of people on one plane could escape earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after his death as he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the abruptness of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would suffocate.
He later died in a hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved the lives of hundreds of people, according to Australian television channel ABC News.
“We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are saddened to hear this,” he added.
At the same time, authorities are concerned that the death toll could rise to over a thousand people, with the country’s disaster relief agency saying that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-metre-high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in aid and supplies.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad about clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports missing man after plane crashes in a lagoon in Micronesia
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now reports that one man is missing, and it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuko Islands airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the incident looked like.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane was gliding past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through mid-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the 30-metre deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analyst draws up a timeline for the night when a woman is burned alive
The prosecution concluded its plea on Saturday in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to put together 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims, the Clarion Ledger newspaper reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He sucked her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final launch on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hip hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?
A New York baby girl sues a couple for resignation after a “racist” text message
A child girl in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a text message from her mother, who complained that she was “a black again.”
The couple denies that they would be racist and compares the mood to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her fears when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A BLACK Again," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "relaxed to the mods", and fired Maurice, claiming that their former baby girl, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home by taxi.
Now she is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal. She asks for compensation in the order of $350 per day for the job she was initially employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denies the accusations that they would be racist and say the only thing was to terminate Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they could not trust her when they had insulted her.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to "extortion" and said his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Should you give up on such a person?
This is not very nicely done,” added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn’t think readers could relate to a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like for a person to read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny, given what we know now about Paddington’s great success.”
She told that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly stolen" after his death.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was proud of his final success.
“He was pretty quiet of himself, and not a proud person,” she said.
“But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something. You get proud of the child even if you’re not the one who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the honor."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transported by rail to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that she wasn’t expected to be able to do it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll be back to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was erased.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t bark or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to bring myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane along with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
“Nobody knew about it,” she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Crying women put up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost relatives due to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells that her son was a promising chef who had an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile brightened the room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, then 11, was the one who found his brother after he killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, “I’m always worried about consequences.”
Sharon Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit down and talk about it.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner for 15 years, Mark, sometime after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt humiliated or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was acting differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It's tearing up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we could accomplish something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - then maybe we could get some agreement," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "split" because of deeply rooted party divisions.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resilience depends entirely on the timing.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if the Republicans make a bad election, as is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to get the one they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean snipers "sinks" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s reunification ministry, says 1,127 people jumped from last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher fees for human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the fugitives as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work to ensure the Korean peninsula is free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused U.S. sanctions of failing to succeed since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances we absolutely cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied accusations of sexually sacrificing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally touched, and from time to time he almost screamed and his voice suffocated as he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were a “great and coordinated murder” organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed he is biased to the disadvantage of the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court if he was elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he’s on right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether to amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not a time for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud,” Pelosi said.
Women have to stand up.
It’s a just criticism, months and years of anger boiling over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
And she continued, “I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she was also crying when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed to get out of the way of anger partly because they are often misunderstood in principle.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried with indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sorry and they’ll be glad they managed to push you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she was late out, she was behind with the fundraising, and made a promise not to enter as a candidate if she didn’t get $2 million.
It was a project that was doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, to stock up.
“You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalls about the press reactions.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘What are they going to write on my gravestone?’
"She's crying?"
Why the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening tides of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening. The war is far from over, but the gap between the countries could benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by coating key Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminum with tariffs.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the United States from China are subject to customs duties.
Beijing has always responded with the same coin; recently, tariffs of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods for $60 billion were dropped.
China has promised to match US action, the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to slow down in the foreseeable future.
Getting Washington to back up means bending for demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be too genteel for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the U.S. trade war press can provide positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the two economies’ mutual dependence on each other.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it’s actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to admit,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused research assistant at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for returnees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary returnees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, which lies in ruins after more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our successes in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rns team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the knockout of the 16th hole pair 3 track, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the tournament’s most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said after the European team's victory.
He handed over the relay stick to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, to get to beat Tiger Woods. I've grown up looking at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has the result of 13-21-3 for his career in the Ryder Cup.
A curious statistic for one of the world’s best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find a fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys they’ve fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the blame.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work on the PGA tour of the United States and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us.”
Algae flowering: stops decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algae bloom concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven flowers are reported in the areas surrounding the municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate a decrease in levels.
The algae bloom stretches over 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles out into the sea outside the large municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algae blooming has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Mean concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Off the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations in skeletons, and concentrations in skeletons to medium.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida last week.
