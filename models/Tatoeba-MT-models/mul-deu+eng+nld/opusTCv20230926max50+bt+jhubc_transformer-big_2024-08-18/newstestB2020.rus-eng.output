China strongly opposes U.S. adoption of “Taiwan Bill”
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called “Taiwan Bill,” which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval by the U.S. Senate Committee on International Relations of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguan said.

China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and by any force, Ma Xiaoguan stressed.
TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
In the documents found in the publication, it is said that the owner of TikTok (company ByteDance) using the app promotes the goals of China’s foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations related to China’s policy fall under the “burning of hatred.”
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general ban of “criticism or attack on the politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tianjinmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under “the story of China or other countries.”
The document also lists the President of the President of the Republic of Korea, Azoy Nayyi, and the President of the Republic of Korea, Nayyi Nayi, and the President of the Republic of Korea, Nayi Nayi, and the President of the Republic of Korea, Nayyi Nayi, and the Presidents of India, Mahatma Gandhi, Presidents of the United States, Donald Trump, and Baron.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, said in the document.
Posts from the first category are removed by the administrators of the social network and may result in the blocking of the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach to moderation, as well as attracting independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says co-founder of the “Producer Center” Rustem Bogdanov.
“Producer Center” is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" agrees with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
Asked whether TikTok can say anything about politics or Putin, Bogdanov said yes and said he had seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the agency Our Didgital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: it is not possible to express shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on."
But under these rules you can put any content that does not like moderators, notes Zaripov.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
By user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neuronet decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of coworking WeWork.

Russians warned of fake calls from banks <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In Russia, the number of calls from scammers who replace the phone number of the bank has increased.
This is reported by Kommersant with reference to Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator gave communications operators information about more than 2,500 numbers from which customers of various financial institutions were called.
In 189 cases, operators found a number change.
A further 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases imposed restrictions on the use of financial services.
Deputy head of the information security department of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that the number was replaced by a wide range of Russian banks.
He explained that operators do not always respond to Central Bank warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the “On Communications” law.
In the bank "Open", Rosbank and Alpha-bank confirmed information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the replacement of the number.
As reported in the press service "Bilan", part of the information on fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would lead to disruptions in the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudulent numbers, to which the telecom operator will contact each call to verify the number.
He explained that the creation of such a base would require amendments to the legislation.

Barcelona blackmails Neymar
The Spanish "Barcelona" and her former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the attacker moved to the French "Paris Saint Germain".
The case came almost before the court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themid.
Otherwise, they will refuse to return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting focus: under the agreement with Barza, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in the "PSG" for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In addition, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him even interest on the late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar’s claims, Barcelona filed a lawsuit against him.
The Blue grenades insist that the bonus was awarded for the fulfillment of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was credited only a quarter of 40 million euros and require the return of a proportionate part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and "Bars" almost agreed on the return of the "wrong" player to the back of Catalonia.
True, the deal collapsed, but the hope for the forward's return remains.
And this, according to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the lawyers of the club told the representatives of the player that if the question of financial claims is not settled in pre-trial order, it will exclude the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wanted to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
One of the most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular, some types of cancer, among them).
Known sources of phytoestrogens - all beans (the most popular - soybeans), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs can not act as a full replacement for natural hormones.

Hydrometer Center Named True People's Notes
There are a lot of people in Russia who are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometer Center, we checked all the signs that were supposed to work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, though, in a short-term period of time.
According to Roman Wilfand, the head of Russia’s Hydrometeorological Center, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will be really cool, as our ancestors noted.
If the sky is white, it will rain the next day.

The rays of pollution were scattered over two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil spots discovered began to come in on the second of September.

The state-owned Petrobras oil company, which has been handed over to the analysis of the samples, said that in their composition they do not correspond to the oil extracted from mines in the territory of Brazil.
“It’s heavy oil.
It can be discarded from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean current," said the coordinator of the trade union of workers of the oil industry of the states of Pernambuco and Paraiba, Roger Almeida, to the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dispose of waste in the open sea.

Only two of them were rescued.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with the company Petrobras, will begin cleaning the contaminated beaches.
Meanwhile, the Institute’s specialists recommend tourists and locals to bypass the oil spills and warn about all the spots of pollution.

Russians have no reason to defer to retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Federation Council Valentin Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough accumulations in order to fully earn in the country the bill on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions due to personal accumulations in the world is quite common.
It is another matter of how timely it is for us to introduce it.
“In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension insurance in the future,” Matvienko said.
Russians, in the opinion of the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of formation and calculation of pensions, because "permanent changes in this area have finally confused them".
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system that governs its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we have to do everything we can to improve the size of pensions and social protection of citizens.
But the steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the SF emphasized that if this initiative (the draft law on a guaranteed pension product) will be developed, then several basic principles must necessarily be provided, including voluntary, the provision of tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and responsibility for the state.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the submission of a bill on the guaranteed pension product (GPP) for harmonization.
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure of joining citizens to the system of accumulations, guaranteeing the preservation of long-term pension accumulations of citizens by the state, registration of accumulation accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for citizens for business and taxes.

At the same time, Fiji reminded that Sony is also creating its own movie theater, built just around Spider-Man.
“So it happened that he is the only superpowered hero to be found in different cinemas.
So as long as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Man, the future can bring unexpected surprises,” he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an excerpt from the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street", in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I'm not a fan!"
Information about the conflicts between the companies came out in August.

We are happy that we can move forward together.”

Expert Tells Why You Should Give Up Tea in Bags
A group of scientists from Canada representing McGill University found that when a tea bag is brewed in a cup in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles are caught.
Particles of sawdust may also be added to the packaged drink, said Nation News food safety expert Elizabeth Tichonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add to it ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
Drinks at the end of the season are not thrown away, so they may be in tea.
"Moreover, the bags do not always include exactly tea plants," Tichonova said.
According to her, it is better to give up the consumption of such a drink in favor of a tea on a scale, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she emphasized that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles heat up to high temperatures, which can cause them to start secreting harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - such a drink will have the least additives," said the expert.

Useful Experiences
Today, in many regions of the country, support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises are adopted and successfully implemented.

And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the directions of support for social entrepreneurship are being advocated for consolidation in the normative and legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will receive development in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state support programs for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will receive development in the form of specific bills," - assured Andrey Kutepov.
Airline Helped Passengers Avoid Neighborhoods With Crying Children
The airline Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when you book a seat on the plane, you can now find out where the young children will be seated.
Now, if you want to stay with them, you can avoid them.
Passengers of the Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) have been given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with young children.
The airline has launched a function that allows you to track which seats the children will be sitting in.
When selecting seats in the lounge during the ticket booking, passengers will be able to see the image of the child’s head in places that are occupied by children from eight days to two years old.
Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the babies due to the possible inconvenience associated with their crying may be as far away from them as possible.
Internet users, who use the airline’s services, have been fascinated by the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that the same should be done by other airlines as well.
One of the jusers complained that a few weeks ago he flew from New York to Doha, and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested introducing "flights only for adults", expressing his willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they will now try to always opt for their Japan Airlines moves as they do not see anything pleasant in flying next to a crying child in an enclosed space.
Previously, a woman traveling with a breastfed child tried to breastfeed passengers during a flight from Seoul to San Francisco.
She prepared for each of the 200 passengers bags of sweets, each with a note of apologies.

“Sanctions” Deliveries to Russia fell 100 times
The Russian government estimated that supplies of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that have fallen under the Russian food embargo have decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from sanctions countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period of 2013, reports Interfax.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4.975.5 million, respectively.
We are talking about deliveries of goods that have not fallen under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volumes of the prohibited imports were compensated by the increase in imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, and Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from importing into Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the validity of the rules was extended by one more year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decision to destroy the sanction applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, since August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein have "joined" this list, since January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
Putin’s decree on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products that came under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has allowed the destruction of “sanctioned” food in any legitimate way.
As the West maintains its sanctions, Russia has also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, to products that citizens import for personal use, this measure does not apply.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation on the development of civil society and human rights Mikhail Fedotov previously called "just immoral" destruction of food, and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, with the initiative to ban the destruction of food that is suitable for consumption, in early June, Rospotrebnadzor spoke.
A similar recommendation was then made to the Government by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Alexey Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and it is necessary to think about how to use them on purpose, assessing the quality.

In Chile, they began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
The European Extremely Large Telescope (EELT) is the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project, the European Extremely Large Telescope (EELT) said.
Its total cost, according to ESO, will exceed one billion euros.
Much of this money will be spent on the construction of the observatory’s building and equipment.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as looking for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has only just begun, the mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developing for three years – since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, which totalled about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
