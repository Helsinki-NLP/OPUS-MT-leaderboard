Food is to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, inflation was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leitzsins; at its discretion, the lowering of interest rates would favour rising commodity prices and a slight drop in unemployment the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is aiming to keep the inflation rate below 2%, or at least barely at the 2% mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the middle ground: you have to "agree" inflation to rule out the need for action later.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Increased food and energy prices are responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans has also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup is facing a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly until the beginning of December, the first time since 2002 the party has had the largest base camp, while the approval for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
With the party-faith voters, the difference is evident thanks to the high resolve of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one-fifth (20 percent) of the vote for the MSZP.
According to the poll, the MDF and the SZDSZ are among the parliamentary entrants: they come to two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has increased by one percent.
Compared to the last low, the overall economic mood has further deteriorated – never before has the proportion of those who rated the country’s economic situation as “extremely bad” been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be “very bad.”
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the prime minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be managed even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, there was still 35% in favour of the remaining government and the head of government, this percentage is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they would participate "certainly" and another 20 percent would vote "probably".
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "certainly" and another 15 percent would consider their participation "probable". Given these trends, the result of the referendum would be predictable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the internship fees, and 84% against the hospital allowance.
Compared to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the proportion of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Even the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaör commercial area also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Articles from the Daily Economy
In the Budaörser Handelsdreieck, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, however, price increases of over 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have been “gallopted” last December, the percentage has not fallen drastically, compared to the still high, previous baseline level.
However, it is certainly disheartening for consumers that what they had paid for far less than HUF 9,000 last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeds the magic limit of 10,000 HUF by at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was at 6800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, walnuts and mohn have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but in Auchan there were 1kg of breadcrumbs for 139 Forints.
There was no competitive price drop on the product to below 200 Forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink incl. bottle cost only 257 HUF.
Still, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Auchan cuts the most expensive, and Cora cuts the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping basket compared to last year's Christmas prices by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent respectively.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive one of the current year was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and the most expensive one of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still at 1,206.00 forints, but the increase in value added tax was noticeable at the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has affected trade: it appears that the department stores were not able to decide what price range they should apply to the individual items, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the trader does not plan the speed of circulation of a product, he may fall by significant profits in the price range, which is based on the traffic intensity.)
Value added tax-related, the price of the "Napi" basket last year fell so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 Forint more than the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was shown, the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office recorded a more than 30 percent increase over the 12-month period.
In addition to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the already expensive product in the previous year even in the worst case has increased by barely more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll the drastic price increase down to the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores are no longer looking at prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the shopping tables.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless snakes at the checkout in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are spared on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overloading of staff - all factors that are not particularly conducive to the containment of infections, according to the lead physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but shortly thereafter the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be carried out since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1094 infections triggered by multi-resistent pathogens were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, the lead physician at the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections, triggered by multi-resistance pathogens, have been safely recorded in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their noses without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the means are too high dosed or improperly applied, the well-responsive bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the everyday life of the hospital.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi said - MRSA simply does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, caregivers wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Although patients are examined for MRSA when they are delivered to the hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is too rare
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be preventable, but the currently prevailing conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for inhibiting the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is predominantly present in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients delivered and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not practiced as often.
Last but not least, because there are no grants from the state health insurance for this investigation.
Most cases therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from outside the European Union for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can be formed, but hospitals do not always comply with this directive.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatients, or patients in primary care, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Saves on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to another by caregivers.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds are barely in a row, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the financially less well-placed hospitals it even happens that when disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that almost favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be much less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government Programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes the health insurance companies enormous costs, which is why they are being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment has been recorded in the government programme.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made the prevention of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death Penalty Police Chief Was Not Drunk
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXIIth district, the official opinion is now available.
The now-retired police chief of the XXIIth district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest Attorney General's Office on Friday after the official report on the case was read out.
The review confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed any alcohol before he took charge.
The former police chief entered Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXIIth district with his own car and drove over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road in an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the steering wheel has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, rearrangement .)
The pedestrian is injured after he has been taken to the hospital.
According to police reports, the manager suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements totaling EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday, with the money to flow into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement concerns the use of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 granted.
The amount agreed in the loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also intended to be used for budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose to Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 also came to the fore.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original treaty and any modifications will be re-discussed.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loans are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferment of 8 years, free of charge.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe pays attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the most sought after tile for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historical towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however, properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also in increasing demand.
According to the estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country’s domestic investors sooner or later, for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russian recorded more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, and therefore, in addition to the summer and winter seasons, also attract tourists in the other two seasons.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving for a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down, buy either revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or downed houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication options are written extensively, but also the proximity to a metropolis, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming more and more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there was a price increase of 21 per cent per annum.
The increase in property prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percent
As Minister of the Environment G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are advising on Bali’s roadmap, which sets the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate going on between industrialized and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are ready to support developing countries financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The adaptation fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member council, expected to be read in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured at the 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" will be successfully achieved or not. The Union would even be ready to respond to a 30 percent reduction in the event of a global reduction.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that had acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a minus 8% with its then 15 Member States.
The requirement for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully meet, as read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high in Bali – after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012.In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not have a new, international way of achieving its goal of achieving the international emission reduction system.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and an increase in the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2<0xC2><0xB0>C would be inevitable, leading to extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army Advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos about operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The footage, filmed with miniature cameras attached to helmets, is checked at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are posted on the Internet.
Inevitably a political message
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such shots, their "channel" was viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channel.
Uses in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Department of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign deployments.
Such published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television commercials, defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in themselves, as they entitle the existence of the military measures that have been decided by the government.
American Advertising with Game
But the army must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage, also creates it on the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, however, this is not at all said about the losses.
By the way, numerous videos of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but this “gatting” has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise in the somewhat different way, namely with the free downloadable shooter "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-threatening simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is by no means sluggish: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a working conference where her employees can make the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant Christmas mood with tombola or incitement to officials’ hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already caught up with the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is now held in the defense district, however, the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are made by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport cross the lines.
The 4.32 million Forints expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola lotion.
The National Agency for Development (NFU) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festive dinner.
The room rent was 1 million Forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information since we have not reached the competent authorities.
Why the suit?
The ILO building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities were opened with an address by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] one was told: There was no ball dress or dress obligation on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are each preparing for Puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 Forints.
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the annual sound conference.
It is estimated that around 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are served only with coffee and pogatsche, the celebration is going to be 350,000 forints.
Self-Administrative Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply run into the Ministry’s hall.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas celebration in its own party hall, at which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent start.
Since the beginning of the term of office of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, the PM’s employees have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will be no proper party mood – not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year’s reception on January 20th, this time the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is celebrated.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured at 1,000 Forints per guest.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple stand-up reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a brief address by the minister and sound with restraint.
As the relevant press outlets report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at either the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which will be held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation form their coordinating committee on Friday for the indefinite strike that begins on Monday.
On Saturday, a large assembly of protesters will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the layoff of work begins.
It is expected that there will be significant traffic impediments due to strikes, as railway traffic is almost completely stopped, and Budapest’s public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the trade union federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A major protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all the organizations that joined the strike will put down work indefinitely, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not pass the health insurance law, the unions withdraw the call to strike immediately.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to advise on the further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that there will be a vote on the health insurance law only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes, which will start on Monday, will have to face significant traffic jams: railway workers put down their work indefinitely, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies remain silent.
At the same time, there will be highway locks in a direction in many places.
The call for strikes has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations – the list of participants is being updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, while others plan a temporary layoff.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ about adequate services, although more and more people are travelling by train just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, at the BKV from start of operation until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA labor unions for electricity and thermal energy put down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union bwz. have the Democratic teachers' union on 8 p.m.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes at different times across the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Trade Unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will expire from next year.
Claim number three is that the eligible professional groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system already before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, which was submitted by the Ministry of Transport, has not accepted the offer concerning the by-lines and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard raises state's risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded in August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary" have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "Risk Alert Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Zigeuners".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition".
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so that since the summer of 2007 several organisations called "national self-defense association" have been established.
"These groups are common in defining themselves as a civilian organization, while openly boasting about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrophe protection, national defense, self-defense), citing the inadequacy of the police, the police.
And all this is done in accordance with that method, which attempts to disguise various political aspirations based on the political and party-drivenness of the population as a civic initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association thus serve not only to circumvent legal barriers that could arise in the course of registration with the court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, so many ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the formation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region," it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risk has grown for the whole region.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the founding of which was announced in August 2007 by the right-wing Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass protests that took place in a neighborhood of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU immediately took the incidents as the basis for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization was "national protection".
In her opinion, for the past 17 years, a regular “gypsy terror” was felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained indefensible and indifferent – according to Political Capital.
And furthermore: the initiative would have started a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As stated, the increased risk of ethnic strife is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to the threats by organising their own protection, it says in the Risk Alert Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, director of research at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and if risk-changing trends should be recognizable, the public will be informed, as in the case of issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so the practice of rearranging the working days around the holidays has now established itself, however, the coming year provides us with fewer such days.
Even in the EU and in the Americas, something else is understood by "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and days without work.
Unemployment days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we are also celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are days without work - the latter is the only way for the New Year celebrations to rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th of March, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August, the foundation of the state will be celebrated, on the 1st of May, and on the 1st and 2nd of November, we will commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each on Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “workday shift” has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
If this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised, the Minister of Labour has been set by his own regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employers, to public servants and to public service officials.
Excluded are only companies and establishments in which the operation is carried on without interruption, i.e. even on public holidays.
Heuer’s agenda is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country will remain formal, as most take the time off for the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, or the holiday cancelled specifically for this purpose.
Next year, more holidays will fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer re-arrangements on working days than this year.
The calendar will first be "set on the head" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, can be a rest day.
The second reorganization is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October you will have to finish the Friday, 24 October in advance.
However, the end of the year will definitely be in the sign of the holidays, after December 24, everything is lying and standing, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six Scary Little Things to Raise Colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, language messages we never receive – harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring “color” into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether to get used to these small inconveniences, or to better deal with the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
- Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to point you out that someone from the marketing department called,” says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting because of that?
At best, you regret it and try to make it good again by maybe calling the marketing department and confessing remorsefully that you would have forgotten to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the thing is done with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should consider how to prepare your colleagues for really unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn’t belong to yourself?
There’s hardly anything more nerve-wracking than reaching for a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the bookmark was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost trust ballpoint pen discovered, for example, on a colleague’s desk?
Without asking questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find out that something has gone away.
So, don’t put envelopes or post-it out of the office in the bag, because it could meet one yourself: no more there when you need it urgently.
Discussing the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a strike that has already been put into the world.
Who's with whom, what's done?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues to the nose as much as possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals his inner secret to us, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to be silent as a grave, rather than directing the one who is not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague as well.
Reported ill for no reason?
If you are calling in the office to report yourself sick with a painful headache because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, impenetrable accomplishments, projects with fixed appointments must now be led by your colleagues instead of one.
So don’t play with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to get into the office the next day, or that something might happen, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, Gekicher, Telephone
One is deep in his work right now, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gossip of the colleagues?
Wouldn’t you like to hear a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not make your colleagues nervous with sums, singing, loud conversations (which you carry over their heads), tremors, constant shivering or sneezing.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if you are not exactly immersed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the fault of the others?
If a project is not completed on time, if you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others have been affected by them too!
The question of how to make up for the mistake again, or how to cope with the missed one, is just too fitting!
In the office - a feeling of home?
Training pants and sleeping: Convenient for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then you should dress up so empty if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just do not become too slutty - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Wanting to make it right for everyone – or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin coupled with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not pampered us with qualitative electropop for a long time.
But now you can even see the noise differently when you hear Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar quilt is back in, the local Electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger had started in Pécs, playing himself in the band Yonderboi, before - perhaps because a host house does not tolerate two pipes - he began to walk his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he succeeded, but only when he was approached by the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Season" by Ferenc Turk).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider public only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, became the almost only trendsetter, also marketable in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand either.
The band has reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new avenues for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression originates from the time when Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger was still traveling with another band.
The airy, flying tone would be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitars, which correspond to the spirit of the times and the trends, are the influences of rock 'n' roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in the Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio beater - the most recent from early to late pop music broadcaster Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi has recorded the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas"), successively.
All is well (?).
The hvg.hu has requested from Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The term "layer music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two cassettes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be soft and unsatisfactory, but they can also be produced only for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop song can also come from an honest motif.
The willingness of the listener to record also works according to this principle, regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences of your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
HVG.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see that more and more are coming to our concerts.
We have never written for the market.
In us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable in concerts where there is already a mutual interaction, but this in turn exists only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Yet I noticed one thing: if you want to make it right for everyone, you’re no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is traveling as a soloist and has built up his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, apart from trying to interpret this into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves as team players who rely on each other’s musical presence and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which was then to be picked up as a drag horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound and the slightly more difficult issues.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to compose the choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-headed choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls co-create it?
Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came down to practicality and terrifyingly spontaneously.
I can remember I was quite electrified at the time, but it already needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, sing together perfectly and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also in the back of the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we didn’t consciously want to give them solo roles.
The issue is also about forgetting his ego a little bit, forgetting who came from and where he is going, let’s just allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most difficult song?
B. Zs.: In the case of musical creative work, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, on "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or on "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything has come together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: That’s changing with the concerts going on and now that I’ve “released” the album.
It’s called “Prophet Is A Fool,” “Escape From The Earth,” and “Never The Same.”
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless Swindlers
Jerome Kerviel, a former employee of the French banking giant Société Générale, is the owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
It came because of him for almost five billion euros.
But it seems more likely that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues the same way, moreover, he certainly wasn’t incapacitated.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in a timely manner.
"He's mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who showed him to the police.
But according to Kerviel’s statements, which the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, published, he was a man who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros by the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already had the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already first reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had deposit problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and was right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I had earned the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits and goes on to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he has falsified documents so that he is not caught.
He even managed to bring his bosses to light, even though the Eurex stock market was gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought it satisfies the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Even when I first spoke in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by betting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses were supposed to know everything, or guessed it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then, at the beginning of this year, there was a big blow.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come to him?
He made himself suspicious by taking a vacation.
“I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who does not take a vacation is one who does not want to be looked at in the maps," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About CZK 125 billion comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to allocate about 100 billion kroner from the program "Companies and Innovation".
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Business and Innovation" programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative enterprises.
This will raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful of the new acceding countries in the case of the acquisition of money from EU funds so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year sentence for ex-presidents
A Nicaraguan court of appeals on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who had been convicted of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kroner) for financial fraud in 2003.
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is coming back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to Ileana Pérez, the chairman of the appeals court, it will now depend on the detainees whether to allow Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n to serve his sentence at home or if he has to go to jail.
A court found four years ago that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had regularly transferred money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These firms were fictitious and the accounts were in fact owned by his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money eventually landed in a fund Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
The budget is through
Yes, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is so special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was still approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because it had been submitted by Minister Sobotka (by this party), and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD therefore could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the mistrust petition against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-regarded, yet highly significant law in all its tranquillity.
This is, in a way, paradoxical.
Everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than null numbers.
The state budgets suffered in the past social democratic governments under three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditures that are legally binding, not only pensions, but also social expenditures that the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit fiscal policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors gave out, in addition to income from taxes, taxes, and bank loans, other sources of investment, often inconsistently issued debt bonds, through which they over-indebted their council houses.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts through the massive sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received in the course of privatization from the state.
Now this source has already been defeated.
Insofar as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy has been going through a phase of growth for several years, like the rest of the world, which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is proud of without fail.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge embarrassment that is mainly attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which unfortunately have been inflated quite superfluously in recent years on a gigantic scale.
Even if it has managed to erase some of the nonsense populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no sooner or later a shift in the retirement age and a pension reform, then virtually any policy in this country will not end as rei, and whoever is to blame.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then from ruling politicians will become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social expenditures.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only contain the displacement of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner foreseen for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments hadn’t spent the last ten years, which only went away.
If we do not really want it to happen that ruling politicians become pure administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can spend only as much as it is able to afford to take on taxes and fees.
Only these allow for the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided together to fight the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed is sending $40 billion for auction, with another 24 making it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the central banks of individual states have agreed on a coordinated approach to defending or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties in the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report to his clients.
“The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more losses.
"The central banks must have really been afraid of what else can be achieved when they decide to do so," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on global economic growth.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used in lending money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as further lowering interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks contributes to the warming of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Debates by ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue Planet, Not a Green Planet", he argued that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which constitutes a strange mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies them and the reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it’s a word-firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that its subject matter is very important to him, and that he is thus committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book would appear in German translation, because "I often meet cartoons of my views."
Now, therefore, interested parties could read his attitude unaltered.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, able to understand and judge professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, that we are not influencing the developments, and thus pose no threat.
In addition, he considers it as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to impose other unacceptable, unproven views, he regards this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from attendees, he reiterated that he is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 People Failed to Exchange Their Driving Licence
600,000 motorists missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets without a valid driving license.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their driver's license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the driver’s license exchange, the capital’s offices are overrun with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration processes around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The issuance of a new driver’s license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver has to pay 500 kroner.
Drivers who fail to make the required change by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also use it with a warning in the event of the violation.
In the event of a violation, the penalty can increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even the person can get a penalty imposed by the municipality, who does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30,000 kroner.
The ministry has already called on the authorities to let mildes roll and impose a maximum penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one is threatened with a thousand kroner fine.
The driver’s license is a document where everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not a personal identity card that everyone, namely a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should issue their driver's license.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers have to gradually change other types of driving licences as well.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court Sentences Penalties for Detectives Associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of having done something in common with the David Berdych gang, received 13 and 10 years respectively.
This was decided in a legally binding judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for Combating Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
Against today’s judgment, there is no possibility of appeal, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also indicted in this case, but at first he is before the judgment of the Court of First Instance.
In other cases, however, he had already received sentences of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned too much.
In January, a district court found 19 people guilty mainly of involvement in robberies, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants disputed the charge from the outset with the justification that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemia District Court, members of the police, in agreement with, among others, Berdych, handed over information from police sources, covered various robbery and helped gang members escape prosecution.
The gang gave Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k 30 percent of the proceeds.
The charges are criminal offences committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Particularly for robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also for official measures and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel cores, a laser-target tube and a machine gun.
The gang is said to have been enriched by millions of crowns due to their robbery.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts found Berdych and a number of others guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's district must be held accountable in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting a final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far escaped the main proceedings.
Children exchanged - Bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a detachment clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million SEK compensation from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> plus court costs.
For each of the mothers each three million, for the fathers each two million and for the children each one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent couple.
The hospital's legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, therefore, completely disagrees with Velebas' proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's negotiation.
"But in order for us to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that made the opposite side.
We'll see if it's worth it at all.
We insist, however, that this should be for everyone together in the hundred thousand sub-area," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion drawn up for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children suffered, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against themselves that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope worse with the after-effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summarized the content.
On December 9, last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the delivery clinic in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district head of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian-Mährische Höhe) handed over each family 100,000 crowns as a replacement for expenses incurred by them due to the error of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they ask for help with the carrier.
So far, the courts have awarded relatively low sums of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka came for his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian king", but the project had built up a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not take part in the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not over and his client is likely to file a summons.
"The issue is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team want to participate parasitically in the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vkas," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the hearing.
In the words "Walachian Kingdom" everyone introduced himself to this actor and comedian.
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Procurement and concepts of the activities," he said.
According to him, the reason is a dispute over money.
"After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitically in our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the term "Walachian king" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, this did not coincide with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Walachic passports.
From an original fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to its owners when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> used only the mere idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public in the broadcast "Manage" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vkas has certainly helped the Walachian kingdom project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who had dedicated themselves intensively to him.
The cooperation of the parties disputed today lasted until the year 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, the disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to pile up, culminating in the secession "King Boleslav I elected until St. Nimmerlein Day".
Harabish Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> was the queen mother of Harabish.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring about the competition for the throne and a half princess prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
A new king should emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details and a date.
“We don’t want to overhaul anything.
It should be something like the king's move in Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also register calmly," Harabish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: advantages disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the transmission, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather under-average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combi with the designation SW is still a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the van is designed so that not even two-metre men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I only go through the interior for a short while so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a rather successful design, where I only have objections because of the caring middle tunnel.
Then I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may be complaining about too short seats or headrests.
The page content has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
In terms of the space offering, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
The already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated in the van.
Luggage in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the loading area.
I have to describe it (also because of the folding back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with holding belts, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, they can be pulled apart and also hold heavy objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains by significantly noticeable 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller.
But to highlight the positive, I have to mention the very flat loading area after the rear seats are folded or also the very low loading edge.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a capacity of 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kWp.
And frankly, that’s what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has low consumption and moves well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, which sometimes seems to be stuck in his exhaust with a flap, then I can only be excited about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine of 329,900 crowns still goes up.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car is once again added with 80000 crowns.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper trigger, electric window lifts at the rear and...
The total cost of the car is 531,900 kroner.
That’s a lot, but once you calculate the extra equipment of a Fabia and you’ll arrive at a very similar sum.
It remains to be decided which brand to choose.
Integrating Slovak pupils into British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which is causing local fears about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original residents are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is clearly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where disputes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually escalating.
Disputes, schismatics and robbery among students have shifted to the relationships between the parents.
The situation has evolved so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist incitement.
Police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus house and spit at us.
When I told him to stop, he beat us with apples and pears and then unleashed his buttocks," a mother of a Slovak student told The Times newspaper about another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported to have come here looking for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students are expected to attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it will come true if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and annoying cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on an island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana was once a warehouse or passage of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban) was liked and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were amongst others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew, cars drove across the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar of the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And the cult cars of the fifties are driving in Havana to this day because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and humid air have long since fallen apart.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, has come down heavily, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights around as right here.
Other places are just being cleared out, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, not only in Havana new hotels have been created, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauges to the sugar factories.
Its fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is how you can see lush and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have been standing elsewhere in the museum for a long time.
Excursion Destinations
The most important places do not exclude the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don’t have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It remains to be mentioned that in Hemingway’s already mentioned estate there is a museum, the visit of which should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Her fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The richness embodied itself in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifties of the last century that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but for that reason nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the "valley of sugar factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which is revived after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba, some call it the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape hardly affected by human interventions.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its pristine nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, there are several mountain tables, of which the most famous is El Yunque.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pork bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, over the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, over the Santeria, an African religion to which many of the descendants of slaves could confess all this.
But, as they say, it is better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO is expected to come up with a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission to Afghanistan did not go as planned, as the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, calls on NATO units to do more, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, a forward-looking trend is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
“Another part is to enable the residents to start developing the economy and security themselves,” British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, even in the southern province of Helmand by sixty percent.
NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have come to an absolute boundary in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they call for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop said the same today.
“I am not happy with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans are represented in Afghanistan in a relatively large number.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week called the German soldiers "faulpelze".
"Afghan non-deathers unravel: Germans make games while our boys fight," the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German education newspaper went over to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government Debt to Accelerate to 1 Billion in 2009
For each Czech Republic, a state debt of 84,000 kroner is due.
Total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe 159.2 billion wives this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion due to better development of state fiscal policy.
The Czech Republic’s public debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the state debts from the beginning of October.
For each Czech, a debt of 84000 crowns is due.
Over the whole of last year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not cross the limit of one trillion kroner until 2009.
Next year, debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion kroner,” David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Picora, analyst at Next Finance, said: “To exceed one billion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he said.
Growing Debt
The state debt stems from the debts of the state government and mainly comes from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by tax returns, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has soared to SEK 719.4 billion this year.
The state’s foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
“Over the course of the year, total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot in terms of how well the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the growth is especially noticeable in debt securities, where the growth is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debts are going up, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes,” Picora said.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of government debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion kroner for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to better development of state fiscal policy.
This amount stems mainly from the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach SEK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated SEK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, these are the maximum planned funds for the Consolidation Agency in the amount of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion-dollar pension reserve, the financing of government bonds in the amount of 43 billion and the rates for the European Investment Bank’s bonds in the amount of 8 mills.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening and subsequently deported.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be pissed off.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was taken home on Sunday and violated Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this issue begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggested eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, according to school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of the 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Subsequently, the children created a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the picture caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not wear a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simply that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knows her well, and she would never have done anything that she could have come too close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to speak for her name.
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as being very attentive to her students and as a person who never talks in class about religion.
It should be borne in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the United Kingdom, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
At the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final discussion session, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is unfortunate that the parties could not come to an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika had been ordered by the United Nations last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia has been and remains a proponent of a negotiated solution, an agreed solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A one-sided declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the United Nations for eight years, the Western countries hold independence under the supervision of the EU for the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to unilaterally declare these if the Security Council should not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations were held the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise was always to be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly looking for a “domino effect” in a region that has been so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be taken alone and alone in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
Kosovo's parliament will have the final say
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations lasted two years.
You have to end up as you started: in the Security Council.
To reporters, Fatmir Sejdiu replied that Kosovo’s parliament would have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be carried out in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush unleashes agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had convened under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He went on to say that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding both parties of their commitments to the peace agenda they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aim for a peace treaty that will clarify all open issues without exception, including the key issues.
This designation encompasses the three major issues that are the main focus of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were displaced from their homeland in the course of the 1948 conflict.
According to the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, which included refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor for his part, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to ensure that they could be completed before the end of 2008.
Bush has set a deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exist side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led to a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories that had been occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a breakthrough in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strip, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman explains.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without permission, so not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two youngsters without a helmet, approached at very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had misappropriated its passage from the right, a policeman continued.
The alcohol control carried out by the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (split wing, split windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the stiffness of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, announced that she entrusted to the IGPN an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger".
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the responsibility of the police to investigate the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard Sunday night, have confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-power bike arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, some sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had stuck together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical review.
The names of the two victims were confirmed yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and that without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains quite cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors in this regard.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations, for which further investigations are needed, and in which one has to proceed very carefully.
Libération has witnessed these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman lying down.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the incident and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen of colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident were taken in the car.
Still, according to this witness statement, the rescue forces intervened about twenty minutes after the police left.
You have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police had not been able to assist the youth.
First aid was provided to these young people.
The firefighter arrived immediately.
Every effort was made to try to save her, the attorney general said.
Tensions in Pakistan are rising
On Monday, Pakistani police shot down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, about 2,000 lawyers in the eastern city of Lahore, which demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency, were injured by the tear gas grenades deployed there by law enforcement.
They then threw stones with which they wounded the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily arrested.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court’s lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
The advocacy movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president called on the people to turn down the judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday night.
He had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on October 6.
Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, the President of the Court of Justice, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give up the commander-in-chief command of the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the emergency was called, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ended.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denies the ongoing rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy military leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
At least eight out of ten births have been carefully planned these days.
In one out of five couples even calculates exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a faulty solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A bold exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the Space Shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to take on the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton module for generating electricity via solar collectors, which was already on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After she had postponed it, the crew restructured the module’s solar collectors, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which could be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable at a length of about one meter.
The restructuring has been stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a control course and then repaired another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to stroll around at the end of the 30-meter long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that was installed at the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old learned doctor was selected to operate on the injured solar collector.
After carefully scrutinizing the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rails on the damaged site.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey beater, wrapped with insulator, to prevent an electric shock on the solar collectors that generate several hundred volts, had been invented and crafted by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation, before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to begin their expected return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defense Group announced that it will have to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 and 1.4 billion to counteract the A400M's balance, EADS shares are currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007, once again referring to the remnants caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 on Thursday at the presentation of its quarterly results, he added without further details.
The group also states that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month balance.
As a reminder, EADS’s business performance fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large A380 carrier.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very tight-knit election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a message broadcast on public broadcasts to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, when he received foreign ambassadors, the president did not let anything go through, and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of meddling – his favorite theme during the election campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud,” he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have gone there.
It sparks an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such a dirty election, not even in the time of Yeltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, according to his lawyer, continuing to ban visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these uneasy parliamentary elections, two further questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party United Russia, the government and the president will be elected?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power so far will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their destiny, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: in this country, which was christianized five centuries after Europe, civil society has only slowly developed further; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin once again linked to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie-Stiftung.
Today, the Russians freely waived the personal responsibility they placed upon them for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
What do you have to think about?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The generality prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why not think for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they replace them?
A difficult memory
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven states responsible for their administration – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to conduct investigations, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are being raped by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of inmates of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with proof of their arrest, in order to give them the way to their detachment.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are processing tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected in these documents, explained Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTA) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The mutual trade between India and Europe reaches the 60th millennium.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will advance the two economic zones enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is still forming the first or second European market for Manufactures for the ten most frequently exported products from India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros for the Commission and services in the value of 10 billion euros. The European Commission has not exchanged their goods and services in the value of 10 billion euros.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concerns about the loan conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to initiate, during this period, a significant part of their savings.
The bank further declares that this way, at 12.15 GMT on December 6, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be put into circulation at the basic tax rate and only until January 10.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has been circulating liquidity for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is prepared to take further measures in order to obtain the different interest rates of interbank loans at its base rate on a day-to-day basis.
The interbank interest rate varied from day to day at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has climbed to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented the banks from using them.
According to some rumors, intensified by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put in circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text, created in the framework of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which was 50% for the employment subsidy, for the re-introduction of the TIPP floating branch, or for a transport section.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some hefty exchanges of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of their proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 announced on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever been at, says his company and Melvin Benn are working side by side to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago, after it was established in 2002, together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival, in the world of festivals.
The two events in 2007 were able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax days, respectively.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
"The goal is to somehow merge these two concepts together to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban one on the American way."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that they are "interesting enough to invest in such an event and to record a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the recording capacity of the festival is "very large" in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners at C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter Award at the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no one is less than the Terminator.
These lock attempts are part of the delegated tasks.
A political "heavy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, advocates the "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones you think are the best,” he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festivals on the West Coast, though that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing an end-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks until the end of the financial year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands in the face of the upcoming final year rally.
However, experts are unable to make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that in purely statistical terms, the month of December on the stock market usually accompanies a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not welcome such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they still note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant, who are investing in the lack of secure equity funds. They are mainly investing in pension funds, which are mainly used to increase their earnings.
Accordingly, in the opinion of these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. central bank, an uncertainty that is leading to the increase in the rate of oil in particular.
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on November 8 of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully end the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional pension fund allowance made every year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could change a little differently, especially because of the already in the second week of December, and then immediately after the bridge day to the day of the constitution, the final year’s rally.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous market assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US-Hypo crisis.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
When selecting the values that are meant to drive Ibex to new heights, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney argues that this year the big values are in line.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two big banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sector.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on track in recent months and we hope other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during the Christmas day, periodic consumption will determine what happens on the market in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive revenue results, even if they are represented only in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only seen two declines in price trends.
When the technology bubble broke at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year-end rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (Ibex has been up 8.36% since January) and can also show an end-years-on-year, will be revealed.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically prosperous regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches are a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 8:30 p.m. and to set up on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeatedly trusted the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim for an agreement, at which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturday and open for this on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for the clientele.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that’s exactly the intention that Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the cheap customer base of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time matching them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is combined with a new room design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, color-friendly design.
Responsible bank representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but was accompanied by an increased staffing since a branch now needed no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience values were positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit, are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and outperforms its rival Antena 3.
We made it.
With this set, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at closing the stock market. The transmitter he managed had increased its value by twice as much as his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not gone too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the value of the company now reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a loss of a total of 40.5% since January, so its market value is halved with 2,193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other publicly traded communications companies rises; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as magazine) to 2,518.53 million and in Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that they are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Uncertainty still raises the question of the extent to which we can actually act stock exchange technically, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
Telecinco announced its intention to be the first TV channel this year with more than 1,000 million gross revenues from advertising revenues, according to Guiseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the previous year’s 965.4 million.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
Analysts see the main factor for Telecinco’s better stock market performance at the high payout ratio the company has been able to have so far: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a generated a 100 percent dividend payout.
Vasile, however, assures that the ratio after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far indicated significantly more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has certain trends in loss.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is due to the reduction in the projected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This has also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
One.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
Two.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buying) measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (holding) as a result of the multiple incentives and the thriving market.
Three.
JPMorgan: recommends to reset expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel to the parliamentary elaboration, which today concluded its session with the Congressional decision in the Senate on the project-related supplementary/amendment proposals, the government published the provisions arising from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressional and Senate deputies, who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation, which ensures the safety of investors and guarantees the individual entrepreneurs' activities, so regulates all.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which re-establishes the Securities and Exchange Services Regulations, aims to improve investor protection, increase the control requirement of the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive will provide financial advice to both specialised firms and to natural or legal persons, and will also contribute to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), consultancy firms that merge with investment firms and investment firms.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions so that the regulated circular markets are added to the multilateral systems of the securities trade and the systems for the internationalisation of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to announce the priorities of their company profile, the confrontation and forms of dealing with risks in the market, and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate CNMV’s control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission foresees further changes in the future, with the decision that the bonded debt must now be considered to be a complex financial asset to the investor due to its high risk level, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the Legal Restriction of the Working Areas of Graduate Economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation on the Restriction of the Working Areas reserved for Economists was adopted.
The Senate, in turn, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic intermediary, which works on behalf of strangers, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (VPI) rose by five-tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price development that took place in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek a comparison of location and quality with US products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by using the same procedure as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) pointed out that the pre-assessed indicator only serves as a guideline and therefore does not have to match the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes noted in the halls of the congressional building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain’s inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion in revenue over the next three years
Northern Rock’s stocks have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the UK’s central bank for emergency credit in mid-September last year, amounting to just <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets were a record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of trust from customers and even despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money will remain safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to earn about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will accumulate there from the investments of the next three years to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that will be needed to achieve their goal of 30 milliseconds.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to allow <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 (equivalent to about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually to flow into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve his goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of participation in urban corruption
Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), part of the municipality of Murcia, this morning on the grounds of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, in May, and could, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER, be the original goalkeeper of the plot.
Officials will continue to review the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and will not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales’ lawyer was accused of being the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged, member of parliament Juan Morales was arrested upon leaving his client’s residence on the basis of important burdensome documents that are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources report Morales’ alleged commission payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Currently, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE’s candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the Government President and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and accordingly will list the PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, take over the Socialists.
This was announced by José Blanco, PSOE’s organisational secretary, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former ministers is justified because it is important in politics to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha-born politician would apparently run for president of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n as Congress president, who had announced on November 15 that he would no longer run in the next general election, end his career in public policy, and instead engage in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president had been continually pushing for his return to political affairs.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as with the appointment of the Vice President for Economics, does not want to prevent citizens from taking over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, and called this an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or screaming, so as to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time one gains the impression that the only place where one cannot speak calmly and quietly in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n and his good work and indicated that he did not want to raise the impression that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to relentless criticism by climate sceptics as well as those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of this, the movement as a whole must highlight strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of the government president Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him to the point of noticing the action or non-trade of his government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain’s position within the EU at the forefront of the countries that have complied with the Kyoto Protocol least.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the regulations, to which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures it envisages to combat climate change without any inconvenience.
What companies will be affected, what behaviour of citizens is to be changed, what individual and collective savings measures must be carried out, and what economic consequences result from it.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanations in the future.
It’s because it’s about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be used to combat climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gas station proposed by the PSOE seemed strategically so dangerous that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty utterances, without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise suitable for election campaigns must not speak, accuse, or demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of embellishing the meetings and enchanting others with his gentleness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and consequently does not presuppose that the bike will become the only means of movement in the future or we are only allowed to refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana belonging to Murcia, the popular politician José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor’s office and a hotel businessman have been arrested on suspicion of urban construction violations.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and in its premises it is located until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents, who had also met with the city administration and with the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the flagships already held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in which it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of undetermined land for urban construction projects are to be redesigned during the construction phase of the project.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but underwent an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six detainees were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and the current independent MP of the PP, Juan Morales, are also being investigated.
In addition, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the group Nuaria, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as the CEO of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to have acted as a subgroup of Nuaria and received the money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives in addition to the arrests carried out eleven other investigations, most of them in companies that were directly related to the companies in Madrid, Vigo, Pont, Lascia.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding business, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia-owned township, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt, with the aim of realizing a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the car parks of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, whose activity focuses on the direct marketing sector.
Things that can happen
One.
If you agree, we will refrain from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price tag for other names with appropriate competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to submit your suggestions.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which relates to the remark published in the same newspaper on 18 November.
The content of the subject Philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the Jokela school.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a graduate who cited the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, Chairman of the Education Council for the Subject of Philosophy, called on teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching be drawn from the sub-level curriculum for the subject of philosophy at gymnasiums.
Three.
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the penal code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which is subject to six months of imprisonment.
However, if you rob a music store with a value of less than 400 euros, this is considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft will be a criminal offence, but the penalty will be lower than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a beat than in a music data exchange.
Participation in a rebellious conflict entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while data exchange results in a six-month to two-year recession.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Under Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less harmful than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyrighted films whose authorship has not been granted by the authors is subject to a higher penalty than distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, yes, so if my colleague should be right, then someone has screwed up his demands quite nicely.
Four.
My GP presents me with one of his long, bizarre research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings that arise from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his co-worker failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and then received the same level; but when one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I’m not quite sure if it actually takes so much scientific effort to get to such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly following the Balkan war criminals for eight years and is headquartered in the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her term will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and a laughing eye, as the main leaders of the massacre of Srebrenica - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - namely the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Freemen's Serbo-Bosnian An.
Their names are on the list, which director Marcel Schüpbach, who is from Switzerland, as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, in Spain, has not yet started); a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, smashes the Swiss prosecutors to come under the pressure of Belgrade to New York.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
The motor vehicle insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it has to be clear what we have to do with it here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be established in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to present the corresponding sum in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, which consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driver’s license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or use.
The insurance companies set their prices in accordance with the statistics, so that in case of a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions will also be due.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same is true for married persons, since according to the statistical values and consequently also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single ones.
The benefit attached to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, the insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also has to study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point, we now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance in order to be able to make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
When choosing a low-cost insurance policy, those under the age of 25 meet numerous obstacles, such as low driving experience and a young driver’s license.
Even if it is best to complete full-cash insurance for an ideal insurance coverage, there are still cheaper alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full-casco with self-participation, so that the benefits of full-casco insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay a portion of the amount resulting from the damage himself.
The amount is determined prior to the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher and lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damages caused by the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to lower your insurance costs; this will increase your credit score by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate with the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and their income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract, which is due to the fact that with increasing driving practice, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it makes the most sense to opt for full-cash insurance with self-participation.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, the Spanish head of the European company explains, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginning.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who does not have children, it is advisable to take out full cash insurance; of course, only if it also allows the financial situation of the respective person.
For insurers, married couples with children are considered the customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full-cash insurance with self-contribution (at an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a larger purchasing power that allows them to impose a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is offered to complete a full insurance with self-contribution (at an amount of 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which is used only with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they are missing to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League pre-round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while this is their decision to take part in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not get the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished in front of all others and the draw at Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtics Glasgow know that they would lose a position in the event of a group winner.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be enough to qualify for a defeat in a draw of FC Shakhtar, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are allowed to participate, but they had two wins in Glasgow last week (2 wins, 2 wins).
As a result, the Milanese will try to miss the Scots the evening, hoping to reach the eighth-final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the same round by a goal from Kaka in the rematch (1-0).
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth final and his UEFA membership will depend on his victory and a defeat at Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could reach third place by a victory and thus participate in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In Vancouver, Canada, the Spice Girls opened the eyes of 20,000 spectators for their first tour after the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium.
Around 20,000 people were able to watch the concert at the sold-out stadium, where a video of the band’s history, which had caused Furore in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore on stage golden bracelets that had previously been given to them by Posh Spice's husband, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd of fans in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his fiancée Victoria had forbidden it to him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham made it clear that the British star hadn’t seen our wardrobe a single time, so I’m already very excited about what he’s going to think about the show.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements drew the group's dissolution two years later, expressed their nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought, why not, so I'm happy to have made this decision, Chisholm said of the separation of the band that had caused it nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes have been resolved and that they are now all very much in love again.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to a report by CTV, the group arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
Upon her arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of child girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23.
New Concerns About Gas Dispute Between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is raging between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being impaired.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is monitored very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will be charged higher transit fees by Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow is taking place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% more for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
"Changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a drop in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices drastically up.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but many of them remain underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish public health service must improve checks on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also voiced concerns that the Scottish state health service did not have accurate insights into the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were performed correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on the Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a field car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
It is expected that the Public Health Service will carry out pre-employment checks to ensure that foreign employees have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Chief Auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should adopt guidelines from the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we have found in some personnel records evidence of these checks, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their screening guidelines with a high degree of pre-employment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations ahead of hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the NHS Scotland's current pre-requisite tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the executives had trouble identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been largely complied with.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was a concern for me to do this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices would be reflected in the updated guidelines on control investigations in advance of the next public inspection - even if all employees were underestimated.
Joy Division Dominates Film Awards
Control, the film biography about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for best film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench has been nominated for Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world public.
The awards were presented in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film – which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has presented two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known to date for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in the thriller Easter Promises starring David Cronenbergs in London.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my type of person, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 Arrested in Saudi Arabia for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an impending attack on an oil facility as well as on clergy and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles in.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to a television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities following a failed al-Quaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a domestic ministry statement, says 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile expert” who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees reportedly planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join Iraq with al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shia Muslim government, which is seen by hardliners among the Sunni Saudis as heresy.
Al Qaeda militias see many clergy in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family, which the government dominates.
The militias — accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to target the Saudi government in the pro-western region — have turned it aside from foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities in the energy sector.
“This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last ... five months,” a spokesperson for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a 16-member "media cell" from Medina, which aimed to promote the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the detainees were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could reveal an outlook on the future of Earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet is even more like an Earth’s opposite twin than it was previously aware of.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unstoppable carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus embarked on a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been investigating the plant for a year, offer a chilling look at how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It will be clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago, like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson said three people had been arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
However, the Republican presidential nominee ultimately declared himself ready to face a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters record questions on video and submit them to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is breaking up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like CNN’s producers, who supported the debate with who selected the incoming candidates to show YouTube clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The theme is one of the most striking themes for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a polling station when they heard things they liked: The TV station noted peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who has pushed ahead in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of being prone to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two stood out particularly fiercely as a questioner, asking whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to tackle this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of getting nominated, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they’ve stumbled earlier and harder than others on the immigration break.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share broadly the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the respondents asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to believe that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now against all expectations in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see if Jesus would support her, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to run for a political office.
The race remains extremely open to the public.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his storms of applause in Wednesday’s debate.
These two are shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkling to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the outcome is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to enter; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No nobility seems to have been sold, no politician paid Parisian hotel bills, no extramarital toes were leaked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has concealed donations to the British ruling Labour Party over <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have worked well without the contested Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the prime minister had withdrawn from the call for an election, in a foolish way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls would not have affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp-minded leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once-afraid Brown from Stalin has evolved into Mr. Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, a bank hit, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have been made by corporate associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative hurdles.
A trio of retired generals started a revolt in the upper house out of protest against cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former chief executive) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably resigning.
Yet governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
People don’t like or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new troop takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even have to be there for a long time, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to get dirty; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to get it.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he can’t claim to be a new beaver.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-general.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability documents, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury Department.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misconduct – as in the long “Money for Nobles” investigation of political party funding – voters might assume he was.
Still, Brown’s situation isn’t as bad as it looks.
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or been completely seduced.
And the countermeasure, as painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s of course Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new witness for political donations is a good example.
The Garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his well-being.
That may be the case, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he would have known about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s chief financial officer, told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest he knew of these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this resolve by seizing a well-known instrument, an investigative committee on the subject - to make the measure complete, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "learnings to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as find a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour Party to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions – bitter pills for a party partner like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is by undeniable legality and solid competence.
Kartenhaie
Is the American credit card market on the rise?
When blood is in the water, it’s only natural that spinal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is infringing, predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both outflows and outflow rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not receivable or are more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee levy from its U.S. consumer finances, in part due to the weakness of credit cardholders.
It’s too early to panic, though.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to rating agency Moody, the third-quarter foaming rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency law in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy reports, which in turn accounted for a large part of the quedite card losses; the number of applications (and thus severance fees) would rise again whether the general conditions for creditors do not deteriorate.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of its debts consumers pay off each month.
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects spending for 2007 to be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debt now that home loans are drying out.
However, card issuers look at cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be of benefit to card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates decrease when the property is of less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexible than lenders to more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We won’t wake up one day and completely reassess the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit cut push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep an eye out for these sharks.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their claims to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated in January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were announced in the UK in the course of a two-year delivery process.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against her in 2002 brought Fastov to the attention of the public that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with the collapse of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers – called the “NatWest Three” – claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron tricks that helped break the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had valued its shareholding in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew it was actually of considerable value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely argued against Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper, and others declined about $12.3 million, the indictment said.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two counts to conspiracy for his role in Enron's plea.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana’s federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on the loose due to a $1 million bail, which made it necessary for them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up billions of debts or make debilitating ventures seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion in market value, and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were void after he died of heart disease last year.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is little money for some of the rich Russians.
"It accommodates up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you are asking for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire’s Exhibition, a four-day orgy of consumption on display, which was held in a disconnected exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury exhibitors had built booths, hoping to interest newly-funded Russians in everything from mahogany-tabled yachts to diamond-covered car grilles that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest trade fair stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's little money compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second-largest market for private jets.”
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money like Dallas to its glory days.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in flocks to Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi overlords of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians stand out as the most visible money publishers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune.”
As they move through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate designers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, label themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking for the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the dust for several hours to visit a decent warehouse, which tastelessly made Cadillac Escalades, Teedderen, Pocket Knife in Platinum, Eevenpi.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically sat at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climber climbers."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old by Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of nude brands with limited number of pieces that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Yet thousands of people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought it.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with gold threads sewn in.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the sparkling orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars to customer requests, said he would have three car cooling grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are the same chain-arm tyres, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter an automobile tyre designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had coated with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a quarter.
“The Russian millionaire, who wants to have a scooter or a picture of his wife’s face made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels,” Mr. Karapetian said.
“He’ll keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage.”
Although many of his Russian customers are wealthy, Mr Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaires” would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in the prices of local real estate.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least act as if they were rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red cell phones that were full of mountains of false millions of dollars bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire’s fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw money around, mobile phone photos, while leaning back amidst replacement wealth, being hacked by friends, or just to plug in a few million.
“Look, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Deceased operation suspected in death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod stopped two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
“Then I saw the casing trolley of the medical bodyguard arrive,” Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
“That was the point where I knew someone had died.”
Authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Force.
Now, investigators are trying to ascertain whether she died from a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results may not be available for weeks, will help clear up a mysterious death that has sent mourning through the Newark police leadership.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hard-working and hard-working,” McCarthy said of Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She was protecting me.”
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney General Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to ascertain whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgical treatment.
"That's one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a galvanized rose bush stands in the narrow foreground and a Dalmatian bellows behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find himself in the provincial and tough political culture of his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market openings that the central bank will try to soothe credit markets by further interest rate cuts were reinforced by staggering comments by the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, Ben Bernanke’s No. 2 chairman, said the policy had to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm sad markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulences would have “partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late September and October.”
Should the increased turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further exacerbation of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were picked up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize lending conditions with new capital injections into U.S. markets and possible further interest rates.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were highlighted by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of their global workers, in a cost-reducing measure, in order to reduce heavy losses from their lost pots in the US.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 Index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month auction of European Central Bank guarantee funds granted to European commercial banks at a considerable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further capital into the money markets in London increased as the three-month "Libor" interest rates for lending between UK banks rose by 6.59 per cent in November to their highest level since September.
England faces decision on statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas here, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, on call, at least under this special title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide on it, and because the table of High Morries, the part-time national manager, does not fit in with any of them.
Whoever doesn’t get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undeniable.
It is never easy to pinpoint exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck rather than ability.
It’s not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective in the end.
Is the right time to go to Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same might also be asked in another area, for example, if John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or subjugate.
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but chances are.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a batsman must get regular chances on the order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the electorate is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind cones into the nets.
Anderson took 32 top-notch wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their shine points and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or maybe it doesn’t make a difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at the time still struggling to solidify himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer still scores and who, despite being underweight in a double australi in a hundred.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following a further discussion in the course of today’s networking session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is 22 years younger seven years, and an excellent balance against twisted balls speak out.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was healthy, was still able to take his position for the next game.
In contrast, the omniscient from Essex is supposed to enjoy life.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket ground and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently beaten a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was get his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) out and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, “Have you seen that?”
Bopara is a much better field player, he congeals his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah may not be there well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he’s the one who’s going to play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and Fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normalcy.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how safe it would be now.”
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be resettled at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called on him to tell him that a local US-backed militia had helped drive al-Qaeda out of their bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop surge and the growth of local “affected groups of citizens” who are armed and defending their neighborhoods in cooperation with the U.S. military.
But more were said to have been forced home due to visa problems and money laundering in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people back.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country’s sectarian death squadrons.
"We did well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis no longer to give visas to force them back into Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shia residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will again fuel sectarian tensions and conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do Saarland have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I declared to a non-Saarlander that we are not French" - this slogan is self-ironic to his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high with 15.6 percent.
But the country’s children also bring the Saarland in excess of the average number to the universities – many of them without graduating from high school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their eligibility to study at a vocational school, making Saarland more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively widened.
In terms of population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
“At the general education schools, after the first Pisa study, we started several reforms,” says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last year of Kita is free of charge - a model that is now also copied by other federal states.
Whether the performance of the students will improve sustainably will only be shown by future comparative studies.
In Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not rise as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better.
And to the devastation of the Saarland countries, foreign language skills are not measured in Pisa - in this area one could otherwise score.
Because the language of the neighbours is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarland is not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez turns the clock
In Venezuela, the clocks will tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will turn back the timepieces in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez becomes a joke.
According to Venezuela’s official newspaper, according to a new law, the clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S.-enemy Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez justified his decision, among other things, by requiring the United States to divide the world into time zones for full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) the discontinuation of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a plague.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
Uribe’s decision to remove Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages, triggered the dispute.
Uribe had "spuggled Venezuela in the face" with his decision, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez said on Sunday.
Even in Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is everywhere.
A new cell phone ringtone in the country is causing turmoil: "Por qué no te callas" (Why Don't You Keep Your Mouth) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the Internet.
He spoke to Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who had been upset at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant interlocutors of the left populist and had driven him across the mouth.
Germany threatens to reduce wages in 2007
Despite the strong economic downturn, according to a forecast, German workers are facing a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could actually expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
“This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in value added tax and the price hikes in food and energy,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research.
New burdens could also be imposed on workers when it comes to unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the year-on-year change was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Labor Agency should not be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Prices rose by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind gusts at the Poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected it was flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has caused life on Earth: storms are said to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything more vivid on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, it sometimes dominates temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's devil twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has hit such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the early 1990s no probe was on its way to explore this planet.
The latest research findings, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
“They also show that our neighbouring planet’s commonality with the Earth is greater than initially assumed,” Esa said in a statement.
In addition to the already known vortex wind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the Earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Space and Physics Cosmica.
The second-smallest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves much slower around itself: a Venus day takes 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is fixed in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the big coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told the trade paper.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasized, but Merkel took protection from the accusation that she was running a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not given up on traditional one-China politics.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to SPIEGEL.
China’s head of government Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China refuses if European politicians officially accept the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of collars as in France
Street battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of collars as in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not be forcibly discharged on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters shot the police with scraps: After the severe youth clashes in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We need to make sure that social explosives are not built up and discharged into force, too.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" in Hannover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities were already working hard to de-escalate problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference, this is already the first success."
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there are not urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police in recent nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
Greater integration efforts by the federal government, however, demanded the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the turmoil in France, Kolat warned of "neighbourhood effects".
The situation in Germany is not as brisk as it is in France.
There is, however, a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under 25 years of age was "high on average".
In particular, more training places should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France “a social control in the families takes place”.
Many young people with a migration background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people must be given the opportunity to participate in work and training "quickly".
Meanwhile, the night was largely quiet in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were deployed, a helicopter overflying the area with headlights.
Competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the previous day, a command of about 1000 security forces has ensured peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured in a collar in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the aftermath, the riots overtook Toulouse.
The collars were ignited in a car accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor’s office’s initial findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The chancellor’s far-reaching appearance documents that the coalition is at an end of content – and that nothing is to be expected of itself.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live?
After their unfortunate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was rude and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by it.
The accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an arguably exaggerated sentence.
That was provincial, she said, showing that she did not want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for everyone how well their accusations are true.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a high-ranking politician who flees to foreign policy and stays there nearby.
Example of climate protection: Since then, it unbridled praises for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
At all, the self-loathing - so much modesty the CDU boss would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flocculus that the upsurge in humans arrives.
This damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than beautify the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low-earners?
There are a few side posts left for that.
It is important to know how many times she promises herself when it comes to child support.
It takes three rounds for Merkel to come up with a half-way straight sentence.
It crashes like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are having a hard fight – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already depleted on the first topic.
He has made New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney sues his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
This, in turn, counters with heavy accusations: “I would say his own house was a port for illegals,” Giuliani counters and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of employing private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow up the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-drawn 30-second videos that Internet users have uploaded via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power,” McCain accused his counterpart, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Also, Romney gets the Vietnamese veteran to read the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated, as torture.
The fact that the main themes of the campaign are now beyond Iraq war and torture debates shows the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, there is a lot of approval in the auditorium.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney says, grinning and arguing in front of base and television audiences that Abbitte was still one of the pro-abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to terms with his opinion of the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf for the first time in civil war
A day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani leader Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
This led to the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has been sworn in for a further five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had surrendered his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, avoiding international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his unification, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill a further demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with weighted lawyers after the state of emergency in early November, last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krutrock are back
Germany’s supergroup of the Seventies is back in music: the three band members of Harmonia again performed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a clip from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
At the time, they were much more famous abroad.
The sensation then occurs in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a floral white shirt at the age of 63.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrating on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement among herbalists.
What we can reveal here: Targeted queries revealed that the name was difficult due to collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainable as to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially because what is called misleading herbicide was always more valid in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Cologne Group Can Survivors the Echo Award for Life Work in 2003, it was seen in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked themselves in the Laudatio even at the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the wonder knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and clarification in the alien is that one.
The memory is already overburdened with harmony, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a much lower power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the much promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a record label maintained by the Church.
Rother had briefly worked at Kraftwerk and subsequently played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-flying communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to suffer as a child girl.
Rather in a sprawling artist's presence.
It is believed that in the blockage was also found a whistle of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
There were some people who kept harmony from it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following was called "De Luxe".
Because the music also sounded so relaxed and modest, the band suffered material distress.
Traveling is not just for self-discovery.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was cut at a concert in Griessem, in front of an almost 50-headed record set, as one thinks to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral claim.
The band announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric sphere and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than it ever was Harmonia.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of nurturing Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
Harmonia’s physical resurrection takes place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
Thus, the entire range of herbal influences on the subsequent pop music would be outlined.
Harmonia fills the vacancy of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's phrase floats with the most distinctive sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legend formation serves projections of further black and white photographs of wirr wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to unleash unheard-of sounds on the instruments via self-built effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the technical deepened fan.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, it is hushed and whistled under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis on "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krutrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power plants) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "68" is not entirely wrong, and harmony cannot be brought to rest from it even now.
Even the most self-evident thing is thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob one of the nerves or bring him great happiness in fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
"The Hunting Party" and "Murderful Peace" are again two films dealing with the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and ballerinas or they are too touching.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: While the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost the most beautiful man of the 1980s out of sight because too many cute, irrelevant roles in women’s well-being films and too many press conferences on Buddhism had spurred one’s lust for attention.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party - If the Hunter Becomes a Hunted" (Why do movie titles have to be so long today and we'll be like lokführer-tarifverträge?).
He delivers a wonderfully eye-catching portrayal: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has long been behind his best times, but who himself has been a ruinous monument of his demise.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" will continue with the German production of "Murder Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Murder Peace" you can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovo fencers, and one immediately falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that here even the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all evil, the flat-screen movie gets lost too quickly in geballer and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is almost exemplary to explore why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters opening up to track down the Serbian war criminal “the fox” could have become a new “Apocalypse Now” with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something the military can’t and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downtrodden cynic when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, The Hunting Party goes down the brook when the reporters in the last five minutes in the time trial succeed in what NATO, CIA and all the world’s money hunters have not done in five years: catch the war criminals and turn the Muslim Bosnians to the Rakhine.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinematography.
The film has a deep human interest in it.
He wants Karadzic and Mladic to continue to run freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should exceptionally agree) not to pursue the persecution because of secret political agreements.
But the good common sense and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately I see the swollen forehead, hinting: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they do suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all of the Iraq films of Hollywood were big flops.
You can add: there has never been a good South African film.
Almost always true: if a star is driving around the world’s crisis furnaces or minefields, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are likely to mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" that are now considered to be classics have not been celebrated in any way as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe we know today where every mass murder comes home in real time on equal two screens, even just too much about the world’s conflicts.
And that robs screenwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don’t want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcasticly distant artist view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>res Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always be in Yugoslavia."
Beust's criticism of Olympic resignation
The mayor’s rejection of Hamburg’s bid for the Summer Olympics has come under heavy criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
However, von Beust encourages realism in evaluating opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called a waiver "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently unfolded as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sporting political swing could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, “which comes from a changed timeline.”
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic competition, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund’s expected decision to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich at the beginning of December.
“This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period until 2028 that we have so far envisaged.”
Still, the dream is not dreamed for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
This creates the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to build an opportunity by burying the plans at this point,” HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also contrary to the statement of the Senate head on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, Beust described Hamburg’s application for the 2015 Universiade as “not a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had not nominated Hamburg as a candidate city until last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has been put on the map of Olympia and has clamped down on housing,” SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for Little Grasbrook for Olympia and a later housing use, the CDU has unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time had triggered a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, in Sweden, manufactured wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol’s factory directory.
Most of the ninety-four glitter boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxen of 1968, internal investigations at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now come to a satisfying result: the six "Brillo-Boxes" of Kunhla are also on the Ruhl-Maßen, and the "Wow" of the 1995 "Woodle of the Hupiuss" of the Pont.
The prehistory is shattered, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of cardboard Brillo boxes: these did not come (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but models of them, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to have a few shiny wooden crates produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which were then entered right into the art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have made more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has investigated in addition to the six museum-owned Brillo boxes also three from Swedish private property, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their presspan plates were first ground and smeared, after which white oil paint was added with a pin.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press panel with a paint roller without foundation - in addition, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve says: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York doesn't come to a different conclusion than the Sampius's 'Modern' version, that's going to conclude.
Already in July, the Authentication Board has announced to comply with the “severe accusations” raised in the case of the soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have been hiding in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
On the Philippines, rebel soldiers who were hiding in a hotel in Manila had called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Troops loyal to the government had stormed the hotel under tear.
About two dozen soldiers had been stationed in the building for hours.
About half of them stood trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly set off with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to be guarding him had apparently passed over to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces blocked the district around the predominant hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillans said.
“We’re calling on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large-scale demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
Manila’s financial district was already the main venue of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The insurgency failed after almost 24 hours in the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
We now hold 20.05 percent of the basic capital.
There had been speculation about a takeover before.
The option to increase the proportion of versatel remains open.
With the move, we want to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, there had already been speculation about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house holds the shares only for a third party, it said on the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already participated with just under 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United bought Internet for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile radio products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
First, the two companies want to be satisfied with a good ten percent share of freenet and not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
Freenet poker, which has lasted for months and is still difficult to see, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-connect customers.
United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares directly so far.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another 4%.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
