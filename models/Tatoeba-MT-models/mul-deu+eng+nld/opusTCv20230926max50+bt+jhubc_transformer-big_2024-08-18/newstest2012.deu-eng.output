No Liberating Novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the request to abolish, as part of a novelle of the Criminal Code, the paragraph on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the request for mitigation of penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet in force, the appeal of the convicts is due to be heard in court in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial raised the suspicion of bias of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted to be removed from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libya's victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners can be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win the elections, the question is only which - the moderates or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council recognized itself as the customary law of the Shar<0xC4><0xAB><0xCA><0xBF>a, of which there is now a certain conception with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for the theft, you briefly hack your hand.
Women should also forget about emancipation as quickly as possible, any disbelieving ones being executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran in the future from mutually controlling tribes.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that would be hardly imaginable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is now not the only and objectively probably not the best, and variation would hardly suit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is more alienating that the Muslim fighters were helped by the infidel dogs at all.
Their apology may be only the fact that the NATO airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a shootout, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians emptied themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the hives have a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But will the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
The West can hardly, at last, boast of itself with the right to be selfless in the protection of human rights.
Unless they are destroyed by the Shar<0xC4><0xAB><0xCA><0xBF>a representatives.
The Beginning of a New Crisis Era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy has stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market breaks all records.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, compared with France’s by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% than predicted 0.1%), while France conceded a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke only of Stagna).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated, and according to the Czech Statistical Office, the trend of slowing economic performance growth was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally over-calculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent from the previous quarter between July and September, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds reached the value of 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yields on Czech government bonds remain below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes will be heard that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a wonderful goal by Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will not again miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz tracked the climbing game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
Thanks to the home team's final weakness, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro, the Czech team also won a lucky 1-0 win, thus redeeming their ticket for the World Cup.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they put the Montenegrins under more pressure in the second half.
The pech birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will be involved next year at the European Championships, it is also a pleasure that the local football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes onwards, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team was off and the wide shots in front of the penalty area were successfully resisted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students of the university in Iran’s Isfahan formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is being processed, on Tuesday.
With this, they wanted to announce that they were ready to protect their country’s core programme, even with their own lives if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an intentional attack to put Iran’s nuclear program to the fullest extent sluggish, according to the Israeli press from the center in Isfahan, the nuclear enrichment facility would also be Natan’s target.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: It does not breakfast and eats for the evening bread sausage
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys have shown - obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Again, it shows how important the environment in which a person grows up and the examples that surround him is for the healthy development of a person.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half as often on the table as in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had potatoes for dinner on the day before the enlightenment campaign under the motto “Obesity is not a coincidence.”
In families with small children, sport is also not exactly one of the favorite occupations, however, which also affects the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second anniversary of the “Adipositas is not a coincidence” campaign, which is supported by the General Hospital and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the horrific increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
“For example, only half of the children surveyed led, five times a day, to eat breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper dinner — one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” said one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative little things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of students’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
The worst was the finding that in every tenth family is not breakfasted at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy potatoes are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do – only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose their own meal plan from offered options according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming above all is the great popularity of sweet lemonade," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, doughnuts won close to poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
The Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of the respondents, who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the informative lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of a healthy diet," the results of the project stated.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give preference to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed poultry or fish much more often than the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less noodles or sweet foods.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had tasted a bit that this was a little too much fabric for the beginning.
I had no idea at all what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how it runs "on the square".
It's gonna get worse.
The closer we get to the exam, the more information and practical tasks we have before us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (no one man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
After all, these are most of us.
One has a too short neck, the other has a too juvenile figure without proper curves, and again others are mottled.
It is a matter of the stylist to visually cassate wide shoulders, extend the neck or enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with big boobs, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-emphasized, without making her seem too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or trousers really don’t fit, you should be able to tailor at least one piece to fit.
You won’t regret this, because good-sitting clothes are simply inexpensive.
In such a tailored skirt, you feel much better than in one of the rods, which is always too high and sliding, standing in the waist, etc.
Boylike figures, in turn, can afford to wear clothes with folds, bows, applications, embroidery or raffle.
With so much information and figure types, I’m happy to have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do in view of the task carried out.
Each of the class participants was awarded a celebrity for which she should come up with suitable outfits - day clothes and evening robberies.
In this case, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I rejoice, because it is much better for me personally than to dress for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos lately (well, that’s a little overreacting), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the pieces of clothing from magazines or search, print and then edit them graphically on the Internet.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design will then be expressed.
It is also very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told by stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The saturday lecture, filled with information about types of figures, was spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work in a very different way with a single piece of clothing.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, such as a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to crank up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But most of all, the following advice came to me: "First you need to know the rules perfectly."
“It’s only then that you can hurt them,” Jacob said.
Finally, I understand why we have to break all these teachings, what you can combine with what, and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more variants of clothing than he ultimately photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) to styling at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look quite different than in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success was also confirmed by Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look is second-rate).
And if any of us can style, then we should expect that he or she is more likely to force us to a very different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to find out for sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding celebrity has re-entered or declined, etc.
Jan and Mario told us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "build up" the outfit.
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he styles and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Appreciate people without bowing down and standing up to their opinion.
“If some manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add some pretty pieces, then we can’t get the whole wardrobe out of her and say, ‘My God, that’s terrible.’
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear to it,” Mario says.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that is attached to the waist and in which you carry all the necessary items.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair removal scissors or safety needles, it also naturally contains such tools as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist when photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are worn or worn in the back.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We're sticking and sticking...
The scissors should not even touch the shoes so that they do not damage.
So you really have to do it skillfully.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned above is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just a fraction of what we got to hear on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me by now - to devote myself to styling on a professional level is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Rezension
The originally carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant mistakes to the routine ride to the early hours.
While it was possible to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, what good is that if obviously no one was willing to do a little more?
Even before he came to the shop, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the old game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension, and in the playable demonstration examples, he didn't seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious how the matched passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you’re used to at NFS, in the end, it’s much different than you expected.
Sure - it's potentially quite decent arcade racing, but overall, the game is shredded by some superfluous bugs that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So, in fact, it is no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a fundamentally incomprehensible lazyness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, one sits on a steering wheel – with the task of being the first to be in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is run on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You never have the impression that the game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the ride through the desert, through autumnal landscapes or high up through deep snowy landscapes seems visually very pleasant.
Time and again, untypical elements bring a bit of variation to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, you have to be careful not to be flooded by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are built quite well in a row.
There are only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classical race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also interfering, who want to smash the whole thing to one.
One novelty is the passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack escapes from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (probably only three).
Ultimately, this thing is more advantageous, because so at least this element does not have a chance to get bored - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model steps into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you need to look elsewhere.
But an action-laden race will still be a good fit for the local driving model, even though you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in good order.
Real problems only appear after a certain amount of time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
From a game of this kind, it is hard to expect that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you practically have no idea how the car behaves before a collision on any object, then obviously not everything is in order.
Typical example: when you pass or pass by a narrow pass on the opposite cars, you "strip" the other cars in some places only lightly, but in others, almost identical situation, you get into the sledgehammer and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car will go to waste right away.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t matter anymore, from now on it’s always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then one throws the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts from the front.
So the restarts are more like an aid, in case something fails, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart doesn’t even help, because nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don’t fit through.
Elsewhere, you will always encounter "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the counterparty passing in front of two opposing cars playing, but until you arrive there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to cross or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, it’s all designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The contractors have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and again here without regard to the time.
The craziest thing is to finish the game on the long bridge, which happens in the opposite direction.
The contractor has to get one out of here, obviously.
And if he is already in front of one, then he takes the view of one of course, so that at the beginning you drive your own car a few times in a clump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and in a place so action-laden that you hardly know where one of the heads is anymore.
And in principle, it doesn’t matter what the “schuld” is on it – the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can’t get bored, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the changing of the car over the course of the race.
You must not miss the gas stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car that you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode also goes the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher driver level, different items need to be opened: from the car, to the backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, this is associated with the online feature Autolog, which among other things compares the own results achieved with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible snipers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (by way), where you can rest on the rails for a long time in the dark (by way).
On the Tacho there are numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (by way), but there comes a subway from behind and goes uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial board, we will probably be arguing for a long time about whether that was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that at some exciting moments the image repetition frequency slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
This, however, relates to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is useless anyway.
The sound playback is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as wide a scale as possible rather to young audiences, a soundtrack was created a <0xC3><0xA0> <0xC3><0xA0> <0xC3><0xA0> <0xC3><0xA0> la "everything" - but who already buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wasn’t cluttered by the mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have argued with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
This is how the game seems unfinished.
A classy pleasure in itself, but one should be prepared to see one of these errors with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vice-President:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the individual institutions out of the lot."
I would not have expected such a hard war to burn.”
"It will take five, six years for the weighings to smooth out and everyone gets used to their new role," said Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
How seriously she takes the motto "Understandable and open about Europe", she showed already in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that they can describe the professorship of many of the Faculty of Law.
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also praised the new Permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, criticism was loud, he was too inconspicuous — a gray official who had not grown up in such a role, but I have to say it has taken everyone’s breath, how well he took the matter.
"He is a person who is ready to listen patiently to and communicate with twenty-seven Member States and, above all, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then declared her as an answer to the question: Who is it really - the European Union? What number should I call?", so as an important step to agree and better readability of EU policies towards states such as India or China.
No one wants to ban our olmützer quargel
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also devoted herself to the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, lived and remembered to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago was described as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organized the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The government’s case during the presidency was described as a great negativity, which greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently in full swing.
With the words of the ambassador, not only the presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite hectic.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes it much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which will be supported less - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s cruel abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, how do I know if you really want to curl up in Brussels or think of cucumbers and various large bananas, or if someone really wants to ban us from the quarrel?
She would also like to use the EU’s soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics, who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more irritating.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near me, then the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?'
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, above all, tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much more real than a "European federation", she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries who want it should cooperate and those who don’t want it should stand quietly away.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that characterizes IBM’s strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word “longevity”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution, known as a modern company, even though it has been around for a century since its founding.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan “Think!” became the trademark for the future giant’s life (and at the same time for the title of the company’s internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s well-prepared corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for an entire century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technology, business, and society in the course of our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, today’s CEO of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
As early as the 1930s Watson operated social care of his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Bat<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid vacations, an insurance by the employer and a disemployment system for the employer plus for elegant new work uniforms.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
From the outset, the company was brilliant in talent promotion – as one of the first companies in the world to lift any discrimination against IBM – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisan will be replaced by a woman at the head of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for 30 years, so far she has held the position of Sales, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, there are almost half a million people employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of the familiarly called "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across an incredible range of products – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or even the disk.
With approximately $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (just after Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The Preview
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC Jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you can’t be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
IBM’s profits are largely driven by services, software and hardware, which account for one-fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware was still the strongest, with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the current financial crisis swept the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume amid the global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM is coping with today’s crisis intact.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008, and the company’s net earnings continue to grow.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed – but the values don’t.
That is why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also overcome the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to World Wings
Founded a hundred years ago in New York City, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name – Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They possessed technologies such as the famous plug-in card clocks for registering the beginning and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who had also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and selling all sorts of machines for trading – from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash registers.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its revenue to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM engineers and computers helped guide NASA's flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous man's flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard at the time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consulting stake of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off in the last three years is the concept of “Smart Planet”.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and in urban administration.
In the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform, which is designed to help retailers lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia – the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters is based in Prague and is home to a world-class research team that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) had become their lover by the guardian of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
If Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, had offered refuge in her own house, she would not have even fallen into the dream of her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth to <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days on her insistence, Joseph went with her.
He even knew publicly that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, even as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> does not care who his wife sleeps with
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our shared home, then I will not chase him out.
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," said Ms. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>; but she also said that they had already emotionally separated from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina locked the back door to him has so far been borne by Joseph with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I'm having a very normal conversation, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who it is.
I am clear that it is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I accept any responsibility.
The Worst Female Inconveniences: What About You?
If you ask the men to name some typical female inconveniences, then they will certainly shake some prompt out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let pass a few unseen revue again, which let the men bleed the blood in the veins?
Purchasing Addiction
Is her husband pretending to be shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hair per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more at promotions?
In your case, it’s really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite halfway under control.
But hand-in-hand, what woman does it take to look for a well-sitting outfit just so through a clothing store and not try all the same (in all kinds of color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times she told her husband - you'd better stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or do gymnastics?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Does that seem familiar to them somehow?
Yeah? Yeah.
Then you will probably also be among the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go for a long time, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly regrets her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a battle against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust that shaves the tub – and this at least twice a week.
Smoothing with her partner, because he clamps again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, scare the children, because the just rubbed washbasin is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room closet already has fingerprints again, but where does polishing make so much trouble?
If you suffer from this type of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and order and cleanliness in family life do not come first.
This immeasurable purity flaw can ultimately also harm mutual relationships and, above all, peace of mind in the family.
Stitching
"Dirty sneakers come in the laundry basket."
“Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?”
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Clearly, this is not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to sneeze as much.
Clash and Trash
Some women like to clap and crawl, there is sniffing or even insults behind their back or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, which is why they like to focus on such topics as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well every one of us women has a little harmless clap and crawl in stock.
Hand to heart - this is probably all women's.
However, this is not to be confused with those of the greatest calibers, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and who pose a considerable danger to women’s collectives in particular.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek halve Philadelphia with their assistants to victory
Ice hockey champion Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr had a big share of Philadelphia's 5:3 victory on the ice in the NHL Monday game, making him the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assist and was named the best player of the match.
Two assists in the same game also recorded Jagr's co-player Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
Jagr told reporters after the game that he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
“Before the game, I told him that he had a hat trick today.”
I kind of felt that.”
"He always gets over that feeling," explained J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, after which Giroux scored a goal on the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trail".
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the Puck behind the Hurricane Gate and presented him between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the start of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third was then back to the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored his third hit, after which Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
“I wouldn’t have thought in my life that I would play with such an ice hockey player as I would with him at the end of my career.”
"That makes me very happy."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
“All the years in the NHL, my teammates put their game on me and now the pitch is turning,” said J<0xC3><0xA1>gr.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who pushed himself out of a penalty shootout, it came to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was successful in number two against one.
"Excellent acting prongs still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last hit of the match from his point of view.
With this victory, Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek was injured in the game against Buffalo and was eliminated in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also beat their lead with an undefeated 2:3 penalty shootout.
One of the penalty shootouts was not able to turn Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high illness-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defenders to end.
"That's bad."
"We played the match with only one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done about it, we have to finish it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each shift one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to face it."
"We should have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defending players.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec fired thirty shots from Tampa Bay, contributing significantly to a 5–2 victory over Winnipeg.
The Jets' goals, which ended a series of five defeats, had five different shooters.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the Czech Republic: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at the time mainly sold only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West at the time only selected ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia embarked on a prowestern course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter to do so, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or also stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good friends" in the travel agency.
That was not the case for a long time.
The so-called currency statement - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a currency statement it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, the vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in the country, no wonder the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and Datchens - a habit that continues to this day.
The simultaneous revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of then Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted in the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply couldn’t get enough of their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
For example, when travelling to Paris, the Czech holidaymakers slept in a tent in the park, because who had already had the money for accommodation in a hotel or a guesthouse at the time.
A typical feature of Czech travel abroad was a full-packed suitcase with canned beer, permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech krone - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, as a result, average wages increased, which in 1997 marked another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare travel through charter flights after 1997, making flight travel incredibly affordable, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had currency-free payment traffic with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-common" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was made to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to far-off sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations fly directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most highly developed countries in the world.
For the first time in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 per capita on a single holiday stay including the cost at the resort.
The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - again a pat threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there is still no agreement on what kind of electoral system to choose.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his position, having called on his colleagues at the resignation to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels broke out again between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov for no reason, because the negotiation did not lead to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in the plenary assembly - only the constitutional representatives or also the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
In this single point, at least in part, agreement was reached, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which in the opinion of a delegation on the basis of power of attorney was not valid.
Conflicts about the electoral order, however, continue.
Even the Executive Committee did not bring any more clarity into the matter, at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Although the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: what should be done in the third round to avoid a pat situation?
"The point of dispute concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether to find a completely different model," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in management.
According to the constitutional model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the larger percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moors are reportedly willing to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense, this mode would question the whole two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the M<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>h side, who thought it best not to turn to the electoral order, but to vote according to a valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees, even if it is noted that the constitutional electoral order of all candidates most likely meets Pelta.
"My wish is that as far as possible the Constitution be elected."
"So that no senseless alternatives are invented, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his comments delimited himself above all to Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the mood."
“If football rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater,” says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adopters, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moors, but there are certain efforts to "adjust" the regulations for their own purposes."
"That's why a re-blocking at the General Assembly is not ruled out."
"I hope, however, that the common sense ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorica, was unable to start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance and so we were feverishly looking for a replacement, how to still bring some of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage.
After all, the meeting at the ministerial level is likely to be crucial, which is supposed to be on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Schools, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have moved the split parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is much at stake: government spending, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming <0xC4><0x8C>STV General Assembly, which is to point the Czech sport in a new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the Pilsen footballer before the extraordinary general meeting, could have been a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have been at the forefront of this struggle at all.
“If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adoptee," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
The main reason for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too entangled in what happened in football.
"I've talked to some people in question in person."
“I can’t believe some people told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k allegedly disrupts Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsen district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, it is therefore unacceptable for Pelta to hold the position of chairman.
"With his victory, the current state would be preserved and in Czech football it did not progress at all."
"Support by Berbr, a smart businessman, gets twice as bad for football," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also points out that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interrogations for investigation in a corruption case, but from which Pelta emerged unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0xBD>il Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who made his previous statement, "he will sell to the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes chairman", but he already sees something more relaxed.
However, should Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k win the Thursday election, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate – Rajchl, who had supported Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the October General Assembly, also thinks so, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I'd go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could imagine him for example as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
“I don’t put my nose in matters that I don’t understand,” said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who had made it clear in September that he was at the head of the arbitration panel with Lu<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k himself claims that he feels the role of the association chairman has grown.
And based on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of that.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and professional commissions, which can be seen even in adverse situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who did not take a glimpse of his antipathy towards the Spartan chief of staff Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>n.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the top politicians for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to."
“When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties state, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to clip and clearly say where the money is going,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner club also does not see Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "over-party".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsen club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which exclude a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make strong for the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R to get new statutes, which in the future will conclude disputes about the electoral order from the previous ones.
The official from Jablonec is confident ahead of Thursday’s hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely destabilise if the Czech selection succeeds.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the winning of funds in the event of his election.
He decided at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting and wanted to help him with the two-month break to defend his ideas about the direction of football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it's high time that the association is run by someone," said the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonecer club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
That’s why he believes he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that euphoria is responsible for today’s problems with the election, which ruled during the times of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Civil Union that he used as a means of locking the delegates.
“If I become president, I’m going to take it personally and I’m willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work.”
"It's a principled thing without which he can't be," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had already announced earlier that he could imagine a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, which he recognizes for his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Even Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k did not attack for a long time, who again did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He has been in football for over a year and can already point to some achievements.”
"However, his attacks were repressive and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many are now doubting his true character," Pelta said, addressing his opponent, who is likely to remain faithful to his proclamations, which he made as early as September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes of games to the national team.
And this should be the emblem of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all cases - from the Bohemian cause, to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Just after that, I would go down to negotiations with the private and public sector to secure sufficient funds for the entire football," the sixty-four-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personal cleanup.
“I first had to get acquainted with the work content of all the employees,” he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandably nervousness.
Despite the then catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If it really is the only disputed point of how to choose in the third round, then we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and he only wins it back when he finally has a new leader,” Pelta said two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If the former deputy chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic at the general meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly leave a lot of people in the association out of the mood.
Rajchl promises that you will start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football, and otherwise continue the work begun by the previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, to performance football for young people.”
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competencies in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member dedicates himself to a certain area."
And I’m going to distribute tough tasks so that football advances in every segment with milestones.”
Many would not be excited about it because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not to run at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't always throw a lump between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation for why he was delayed.
“But a lot of people told me that I shouldn’t give up because otherwise others would too.”
“That’s trust you can’t play with,” he said.
He also allegedly motivates him to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to throw that away.”
"Proceedings have been started that will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would just not like to see them stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - could be elected, the situation could go back to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“Behind him are mainly people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones.”
You can tell me something, but not that I’m biased.”
“I try to be objective.”
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even though some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Mormons."
"For example, it's time to consider whether to divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then each rise to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moors," says Rajchl.
Now that Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the Pilsner club, has joined the fight for the presidency, Rajchl does not trust to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl, who also led to the saving of tens of millions of crowns for Lohsie for unfavorable contracts, the association, said.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta, "he has previously been disqualified from helping Czech football regain confidence," he thinks the second rival - Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k - is a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated and also the personnel crew in the commissions would obviously not fundamentally change."
He certainly wouldn’t want to turn things in his favor,” Rajchl said of his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planchpools in Ufo optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest the tired legs in splash baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past year and a half, one thing could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Laying back on the water, she looked up in artfully designed domes, she swam in front of marble pits waiting for her at the rim of the basin, and was amazed at the acribly restored youth style swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it up in her notebook - including informative details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored by architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one in Luxembourg, Croatia and Serbia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports, she doesn’t have much on the hat, says Meder - only in the water it’s different.
It’s only annoying that swimmers have to settle down with blue tiles and chlorine tank, while joggers can breathe in the annoying scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful bird’s whistle in the park.
“I asked myself one day why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Plates in the jumping pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is therefore so great, because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have struggled, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-scale picture tape "Badefreuden" offers 190 pages of information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-soluble water in a rustic karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building in Ters<0xC3><0xA1>ny (V<0xC3><0xA1>ro).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three open shells upwards it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine rose in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much like heating oil that it is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose click sticks to the skin as soon as you slip into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
At one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing sites: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech bathing area of Luhatschowitz, she found a closed ground.
The bathroom, designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
In contrast, the decline has been reversed in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has three phases behind it; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements that date back to its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - not only because it originally came from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a performance to merge such different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only a by-product.
Agro-speculation
Deutsche Bank to illuminate raw material business
By Christian Teevs
Is the Deutsche Bank relinquishing its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO will then draw consequences.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions quit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges are driving prices upwards – and therefore banks are co-defending the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is targeted specifically against German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material bets were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But by now, most experts agree that the sugars have been decoupled from supply and demand – and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to review the allegations and said that no business was "worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then announce what consequences it will have.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade, or even the complete reversal.
Farmermann bastelt on his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "The bet on rising food prices shows particularly drastic how reckless banks today are damaging the public good."
Ackermann is now in charge as the top banking lobbyist.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether it's Mr. Ackermann's case of people suffering from hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board differently than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible intrusions, he hardly needs to shave himself - it would have to do with his successor in the end.
One in two would cancel raw materials plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Eleven per cent believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities in which prices for food are being wagered.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would cancel all investments where money flows into the commodity speculation, according to the survey.
43 percent of the people they know from such a bank would decline, 49 percent would say to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and a happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and faded.
It is now reopened as an exhibition hall.
If modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials, typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an example of the world exhibition in Brussels in 1958.
Schwanzer's Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus shell-like by-product in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna’s South Railway Station and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century – the “20th house” was called it.
But the building was not spatial and technical as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art was given a new home in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21st House" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens its first exhibition - a coincidence in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has made a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a graduated art historian with a considerable career in the youth, among others as an ice skating artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, Spo<0xC5><0x88><0xC5><0x88><0xC5><0xBA>ln und Mits<0xC3><0x96>lntütz firmly established the transformation of the modern Salzburg museum.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built for this.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal group for the execution.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s secession in Vienna sensibly and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an “incredibly important place” for him to watch the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and ease when it was moved to Vienna and reused.
During the current renovation, there were far bigger problems: the building was “an energy rush,” says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, fiberglass reinforced insulation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements provided space for new use, a lowered light pit between house and road provides exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust-protection color.
And the cinema is still exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and renovations, the building remained flexible and lightweight.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "raise a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because an urban accident has occurred: around the Swiss garden is just the newly planned "main station quarter", with office and residential houses.
And another lucky event may still occur: the 21st house could receive reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Swiss garden.
Train Plans Winter Crisis Package at Millions Heights
The train has implemented a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" magazine reported in advance, relying on an internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of a total of around 300 million euros would be planned.
This will help to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for the snow removal on railway facilities and ramps to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free railway tracks up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary soft spots within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays even this winter after a summit meeting with the government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railways Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years, the railway has also created the need to have axles of ICE trains checked more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break at Cologne Hauptbahnhof.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in U.S. fines
After the turmoil about boss Josef Ackermann comes new trouble from the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fines there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also catching up with its past in the United States: The Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the plethora of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of big banks of misleading the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have downplayed the risks.
These types of securities have lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and are tearing the banks into the depths.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a German bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank did not admit any debt to the comparison.
The same goes for the Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the reception of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and jumps in at Pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to compensate for the billion-dollar damages.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also joined other major banks and in the summer sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Mortgage-backed securities are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
This is underpinned by home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became the hang of a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers flipped over.
Even though the events have been going on for a few years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits in order to get reimbursement or to deal with faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It alleges 18 major international banks that two U.S. state real estate funders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, overspend on mortgage transactions worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint with the FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurters to stand for “substantial losses” without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had consistently rejected the claims and declared its intention to withstand them.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Finance guru Buffett invests heavily in IT company IBM.
Since March, he has been buying up shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always said not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies can only be poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his view on investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and acquires computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's blow to the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT urgestone can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in the US economy broadcaster CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which, even in the economic crisis, had provided decent profits.
“You’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett was approached, for example, by a freight railway, by a lubricant manufacturer or by machine builders.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns some 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money has earned him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
Following the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM’s stock rose by 1 percent in the first place.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, is worth a total of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it, together with Apple and Microsoft, one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he did not want to enter.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now alive again.
The murders of eight Turkic tribesmen and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is being reacted in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, a long-dead-believed ghost returns: Since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The existence of xenophobia in Germany, however, was never in question.
The uncovered right-wing extremist network, however, reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators must have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing smuggling.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted remarkably: it reminded the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a memorial guard at the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought about the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colors, the co-creation had been staged - as a story of success.
As an earring, the report of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fifties" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also the German edition of the "Hürriyet" can not be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It's starting to stink," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that people have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Extremely critical in German Internet forums the police’s actions and their subsequent success are being discussed.
Why it has not been much more likely for the German authorities to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic measures: “If we continue to be smuggled here, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and armament.”
"That will probably be the best self-defense."
"The quality of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very heavily on the inner peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, explain the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the Solingen fire ruins is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks intensified the sense of security on the Turkish side.
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was especially flawed: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a letter of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented at the mourning party in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time how many taxes the local Turks paid.
As if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting by the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has since been.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive clarification and reassessment of right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Skandal Bank from the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now I'm going to judge a German.
Axel Weber probably didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and made friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything was going to be different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and raised around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a famous banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS has also been attacked - and all the questions are: when will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber was allowed to consult the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board already in May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is going to be tough.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a banker and would certainly have needed a working time.
He then takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of “largest scandal bank in Europe”.
Because on the one hand, UBS is huge – until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager – and on the other hand has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also outspoken Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: it wanted to become a very large number in investment banking too.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money for wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "I always left the UBS to my students as a model of a good bank at that time."
“From today’s point of view, one wonders: how could I be so wrong?”
He was terribly wrong.
In 2007, it was revealed for the first time that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had been looted with subprime papers and had to debit billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of say and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors who, until recently, would have had their noses crossed: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so silent that they didn’t even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, with President Marcel Ospel, the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigning in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was in the financial crisis before the collapse due to its failing investments and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced-money bond through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times that of Switzerland’s economic performance (see graph).
“Once again, we couldn’t save the UBS,” says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and said it was willing to disclose the data of wealthy customers who might have withheld taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions including a penalty.
As a result, the UBS was more or less open to helping with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both key business areas: in investment banking due to misconceptions and in asset management due to tax evasion aid.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it back, then this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single dealer is ticking 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes obvious: the risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
“With the Adoboli case, one has to find that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also confident: "The problem with UBS is that it is not in control of the risk."
It was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, security for money for that - even beyond the Alpine Republic might sometimes collapse the world.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the well-established Swiss private bank - it is only slightly larger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on the Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Mountains.
The buildings here are plentiful, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have lived here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has been pushed by both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does business with the two big banks, as well as all Swiss bankers.
The UBS has become much too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Angels had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Angelic Axis."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, first gave it high profits and then the debakel: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became apparent.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million-nation country decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save the bank facing bankruptcy.
How could that be?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks merged into a huge group.
There was a bank that was too big for the little Switzerland at the time of the merger – and it continued to grow.
The two different precursor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but asleep bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already stronger international bank.
All of a sudden, the internationalized investment bankers came in favour of a lot of money with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectual, the modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from banking to the very top."
But Ospel ultimately relied on Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake: “He thought his models were the reality,” says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that superstition came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs bumped from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go up there.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the forex trade and in the stock trade, she played a key role.
However, the company’s consultants who were hired highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language “Fixed Income”, there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime investments.
It evolved into a huge machine that packed and spreads securities on American mortgage loans – but also retained risks itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there,” says banking expert Geiger.
So much euphoria, so much so.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts to clean up seemed more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS have become the locksmith seat and are still staggering to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has abandoned all the business models nearby.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: ending investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to the Swiss roots.
So far, the bank does not (yet) want to go.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only meant as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separating itself from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has worked hard to maintain the business of UBS on a permanent basis, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to its position in the mid-1990s.
3,500 posts are deleted.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, he has only publicly said that he and his wife will be looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe hits U.S. stock market
The imminent recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors for the week-long upheaval.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The thwarted industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the keim.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass have gone half-full last week, not half-empty – but now the problems have again come to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, the financial values were on the sales notes.

Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced their production and is set to end the boom.
The companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We are not an island, we are dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
For this reason, it is too early to invest in European bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the traditional group’s stock price and led it to initially score just under one percent higher than the trend in trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Intelligent crabs are spreading in cities
In many places, seed crabs are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
The one likes them, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: crabs have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents complain about dirt and noise from animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crabs could no longer be brought out of the cities, experts said at the first crab symposium in the East Frisian void.
There, specialists from all over the federal territory consulted about possible escapes.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural escape of the specially protected seed crabs: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing populations and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Cranes are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in Westphalia, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crabs in the county had provided for negative headlines.
Critics have described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with knuckles as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the grazing, does not bring anything," said urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Nesting with water or falling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals soften, large colonies split up and spread to other places."
Gramification is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t get them away anymore.”
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Empty.
It is conceivable a combination of grazing the animals from sensitive living areas and locking facilities to resettle them in other places.
The psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, called for a completely different treatment of the animals: "We can finally tolerate a tick in the face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Asheberg Crane Teaching Path in Schleswig-Holstein, where signposts inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed cranes.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the critique of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crabs not only use tools to get to a treat, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed cranes how far the birds’ intelligence goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones to get to a motley larva.
Without much training, they purposefully realized what size and shape a stone must have in order to have the platform collapsing.
In a second attempt, the peppery crabs then had to solve a more complicated problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a motley larva.
With the snail, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid pieces of wire on them.
All four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then hunted the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crabs even managed to do so.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 World Cup
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup were out.
Favourite Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland participated in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have settled the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship appearance after the 0:0 draw.
The Czechs scored a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off draw with Montenegro, after the draw (2:0) had been a clear thing.
In the 0-0 draw against Turkey, Croatia won a 1:1 (1:0) draw against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the next hits for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had cut twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a custom-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters for an early lead into the mesh.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his shot quality and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a header on the bottom edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 vice-champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the 1976 European Champion will compete in the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a scary second already in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its biggest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from turning from the penalty area limit just past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crossbow had to save for the already beaten world class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
At the end of the day, the gate made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to secure his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the poles in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the jumper in the goal.
After the second of terror, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who took place from the 62nd minute for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, there were also Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4–0 success in the back, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equaled for the guests.
Ireland pushed up the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible leader.
In the 32nd minute, it was that far.
After an unfortunate defence by finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was at the spot and pushed the ball to 1-0 over the line.

SAP to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” co-chairman Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of offices of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are located in the boom country.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase its sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running as well as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, backed by comprehensive enlightenment.”
Mass Massacre on a Personal Level
Sensitively and generously, Peter Englund’s new book “Beauty and Horror: A Story of World War I, Narrated in Nineteen Classrooms” begins with a long list of main characters that goes to one’s heart.
Here’s a tip on how to do it: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel story, and these protagonists will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which will award the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not inadvertently describe as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, rushing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war combined, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get mad or die.
Each of these lives flares up like the votive candles in a church, some come in, while others erase.
Englund’s book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that World War I was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Horror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tick flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, which smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, and hears cannon fire in the distance. Stay or take the escape?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "were furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's matron.
Their stories were mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be terrifying or gripping, but they are extremely lively in Englunds of the indetailed accumulation of small moments.
Many of them act of deficiency and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He talks more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from squeezed rice and baked in hazelnut grease (and last served with a wrong bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes soaked with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, in spite of all this, this is what was more intended for men than to sit in a chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and to do so unkindly and humbly, as if it meant such a bardling fassas."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
“If you take away from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it's as horrible as "a convicted man who was secretly hanged."
Other observations deal with the old Europe, which is falling apart, and with new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic contest," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young century": "the word used and ideologically convinced mass killers in the outfit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get involved with a prostitute with a sexual illness in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade in gonococcal eggs, because soldiers bought and lubricated on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital," he writes.
“Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which the war "detached uncontrollable forces in a one-off way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are bringing them to the fight.
The best books about World War I were mostly falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" rather than extensive history books.
Englund’s band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I’ve ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it’s as if he’s smashed this page with the main characters in front of his nose and lit us with a stick.
After an early failure, a minute-long planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
One had opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, all of whom initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the desert and gave homeowners an enormous increase in public sympathies, were not allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were being handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training – counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, what a declaration of "exercise" he said.
“The few police officers I know were involved didn’t know it was Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wants to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then waved back when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned of these plans.
Officers of various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including operational commandos from across the city – hundreds of mobile officers who are usually deployed in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and exit the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people stay in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were available in front of the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages flowing from the speakers seemed to scare many protesters.
As public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply packed their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and possessions.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists say they were trying to stop them from watching the police action in the park, and they said the officials' handling was very harsh.
Mr Browne said that TV cars in Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved westward through the great mess of the protesters’ personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags of clothes, their cleaning staff followed, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A main core of protesters related near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some barriers were erected and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp are tied together on their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Disaster protection officials were called in to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, police said.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were, as he said, due to “inappropriate conduct and resistance to arrest.”
The most prominent official in the area was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly did not “lead the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials were waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how from these locations the police were expanding the area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, it was observed that several officials, many of them with signs of protection, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At about 5 p.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of Sperrholz.
In the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of supervisors will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school administrators who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals are unnecessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last option that the trade union, District Council 37, remains open in its efforts to rescind dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the city’s poorest paid employees and had lost their jobs in a chess move on October 7, the trade union leader was described as political revenge among the household members for having given up the group’s paychecks, and had access to the city last year.
This allegation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing by the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the dismissals were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council threw back and explained to him that there was nothing in the budget that would specify that school help staff would be fired.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education about a lawsuit, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference that will formally announce the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city’s Ministry of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latino women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Justice Department, said the city did not file a lawsuit and could therefore not comment on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city's poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit over inequality, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers as they chronically underfund.
She reports that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and only a few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Finding the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 percent of students were living in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not neighborhood-watching parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost as the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" in the United States usually describes a teacher's shift from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not handed over," the complaint said.
Mission ends, Congress ready to reach an agreement on Libya
Ultimately, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on International Relations passed a resolution that endorses President John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), calling Libya "for its successful rebellion" and "for the United States of America."
“This resolution honours the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simple in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both the parties and the White House are arguing about the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad marginal group of both parties and no vote was taken.
The same day, however, the law passed in the Senate, and the House passed a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission got into a kind of legislative feud – with a congress that, while imposed enough to criticise Obama’s approach as part of the mission, was not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the Congress was overshadowed by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "lobs the men and women of the U.S. military and their Mu-women, their pro-professionals and coalition partners."
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in Libya’s successful and irrevocable transition to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board, or will they split the legislators, as the law of June did?
The last version is against the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatt's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and covers a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate - others just soften slightly from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensatory budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control federal spending.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients—especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their resumes—the opportunity to boast that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limitation to two terms of office of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits same-sex marriage is just as much a change that prohibits the burning of flags as a recurring proposal.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eager as the members are to propose changes, so unequally they move faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, 77 such amendments were introduced by lawmakers. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed already in 1789 to Congress.
"Affected, but not defeated," Giffords said in first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man from close range had shot her during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, singing back alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow," he said, to grow up in "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow."
When she appeared alongside Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ranked by words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage inflicted by the bullet, which split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her voice on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang — and described their recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special recorded just before the release of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you see her in the hospital bed, with barely shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nick with its head.
A pussy with a lip.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You see the congressmen singing along with the therapists on Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he read an article in a daily newspaper about the attack on March 12, when she interrupted him and for the first time asked about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is being forcibly treated while he waits for his trial.
“A lot of people have died,” Giffords Sawyer said.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During his wife’s recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, “I was hit.”
“So, I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t defeated,’ ” Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you’ll survive it and you’ll recover and you’ll come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smoking stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was observed by the chief of staff and then-chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was compassion.
The scratchy contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public increasingly behaves as if you were suffering people in uniform.
“We were by no means victims,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to help is to push us into the role of unfortunate souls.”
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They have also recognized that the anger that recurring troops fought in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion in silence and private take place between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a sense of reverence, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “wrong, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took a senior state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about your service, you have to resist the negative impressions,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military stems in part from the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Performance on the battlefield is seldom seen as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common during World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public mostly focuses on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military Faces Growing Pressure to Take Hard Steps in Rape
An important hearing this week will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-aggression in a rape case before the military court.
If it does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped at night by a fellow soldier.
It was October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman wiped away her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after going to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it will decide whether a lawsuit that will be brought against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be raised.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not go against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the lawsuit initially consisted of 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months it rose to 28: 25 women and three men who all claimed to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers.
Burke says she pursues the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation of the? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject the lawsuit.
The court’s files present at Newsweek detail the defense strategy, in the first place that the military cannot be charged with current or former soldiers for injuries to which it came into the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged damages occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document said.
The Department of Defense denies any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to modernize, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a woman-friendly atmosphere.
Notwithstanding this, Vietnam Veterans of America collects a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to dismiss them from the service - a customary act of service law, according to Wo'action group, human activists such as Anu Bgwai.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the Administration of War Veterans), accusing her of discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted to Congress independently by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of hints.
In 2010, the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office reported 3,158 sexual abuses, according to the Department of Defense.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, which was published in March, also examined the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first in a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the assault.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole host of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, asking her for the sex she had before the assault with her boyfriend.
Six people spoke as witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually released.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman said.
"I thought the cries would be used. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was unfairly dismissed, so she was not given any support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he remarks, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first challenged.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them that they try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are made,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who had confessed to having committed an amok in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer attack and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting far-right groups on social media.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It’s easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found it wasn’t hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s concealment of personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy — as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans from far-right groups across Europe and then visualized them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or a new dietary product, the adds invited users to a survey in which their educational status, their own attitude towards violence, and their own assessments were assessed.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
“It’s a fairly new method of research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online advocates of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more rational, democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as “likes”, text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook’s “Data Supernova” is generating a research tree that has increased the number of scientific work titled this page by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this site people that you don’t usually reach with your clipboard on the street.
“If you tried to interview people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them.”
"They had to inform the party first, and they would never have allowed them access," Bartlett says.
“It’s all gone on Facebook – you’re going straight to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook were significantly more likely to drink problems than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal students, such as housing consultants, monitor the page and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify endangered children who would otherwise not have been found.”
Facebook is also constantly collecting the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics about the relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election participation in the mid-term elections 2010 and a national luck index (using primarily data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedoms for a long time to know that the site should make its big data gains for other pits).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to provide its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know anything about yet?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, in a 2006 study in which he surveyed the public pages of students on Facebook.
“As far as she was concerned, it was only about her and her friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research needs to take care of social – and every lot of social life is still taking place offline.”
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who claimed two amoks in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knights Templar in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I appeal to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
“I acknowledge the laws, but I do not confess myself guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "would not give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he does not have access to the media for four weeks, he said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was staying behind the castle and lock.
Everyone took part with the goal that everything would go awry.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes on a bit after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre indication that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may seem to some that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of an individual extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 Lessons from the Interview with the Deceased Steve Jobs Showed in a Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting engineering as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings in key markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acribic organizer who eagerly crafted diagrams - a man who believed that many executives on "a disease of thinking" suffer from "a great product to a great one."
In 1995, Bob Cringley developed the TV series "Triumph of the Specialists" about the breakup of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this time, more than 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used in specialists, he says that the interview’s copying templates were missing during delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which is coming to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for hating detailed interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and prompts him to come up with topics or sidelines of greater importance faster.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems somewhat uncanny when Jobs evaluates what other companies think is right or wrong and represents his own vision for the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs’ career, but seeing jobs here as the coveted dreamer who’s on the hop to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled out and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned how to run a business:
"Throughout all the years in business, I always ask, 'Why do you do things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's just how it's done.'
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs is continuing his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonishing how costs were recorded – usually starting with “standard costs” that were numbered on mere assumptions and then adjusted with “deviation” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the pope was illiterate:
Jobs tells of the “Blue Box” he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to engage in telephone conversations for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a toll-free phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent stuff around the globe half a dozen times, and when you grew up on the phone, a minute later, it came out on the phone next door,” Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be without it Apple.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious stroke that Wozniak and he almost took off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were as good as they could imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs was one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovations:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built up some boards, he was asked by a client to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember pervasive arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was unbelievable.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions got into trouble and lost control of their stocks.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copier or printer, after all?”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [there are] those people who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eroded by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products – craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, Microsoft could have been the 1990s.
You have captured the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it goes beyond the taste, it goes beyond trying to sit out with the best stuff that humans have created, and then trying to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn’t been the computer industry, they would have done fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas Dine With Opponents of Health Laws as Court Adopts Case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically participatory question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a case that was filed by Kanzlei.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a hit among conservative activists across the United States.
In fact, a five-and-a-half-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who stands before the court and will claim that the law is rigged will likely be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under George W. Bush’s government.
Clement’s firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted on the case in a Washington hotel.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican faction in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And this is not in violation of moral rules.
In fact, the judge frees himself from the code of conduct that regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charity events in accordance with the law and other organizations, where the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor or a guest of such events according to the program."
Nevertheless, Scalia’s and Thomas’ extreme closeness to two of the case-related law firms and a company with a massive financial interest in it were sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
“This astonishing breach of morals and opposition to the Code penalizes the lawsuits of some judges for lies, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dine during a charity event with lawyers with floating proceedings in court."
Your appearance and your support of a donation campaign for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would too easily confuse the court case with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney general under the Obama administration when the first legal disputes came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from hearing the case due to bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unpretentious.
Kagan doesn't make any arrangements to do this.
Boeing pulls record order of $18 trillion on land
Emirates has ordered 50 twin-engine Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing is selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order of over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is a record total of $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest ever order for commercial jets over the weekend, based on the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced it at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort, according to Oman Air.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar stock exchange expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but rather an increase in oil prices that usually harms the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, not so harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural safeguard,” he said.
The order from Emirates confirms Boeing’s leadership position in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS in check, who is attacking pre-eminence with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing’s shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister appears to lose election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governorship.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her candidacy for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and especially on yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they have occupied election booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, who had conducted polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently still in office governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the split and unhappy left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have stepped out of the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how repulsive the elections in Michoacan are.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look bravely into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the two fastest-growing economic nations in the world must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking “passionately” at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources by Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
The European Monetary Union has entered a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have increased dangerously and the prime ministers have resigned from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe shakes fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) – gave greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said India will “do everything in its power” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and the dehydration of foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because elsewhere we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no incentive to help the rich Europeans when they face great economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India aid for Europe, of whom more than 800 million of 2 dollars or less live on the day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece poorly managed, losing facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on the whole of Asia.
ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/threatens now “the risk of graduation” due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital shift in their vocabulary.
Pentagon Urgent Warnings of Possible Interceptions in Defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up to Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would inadvertently weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil war zone.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a conclusion in spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a Congressional failure to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% overall cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
“Such a high cut, carried out in such a reckless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or building — and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the Senate.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from most of our civilian personnel, and since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would certainly have to hire civilians to achieve the goal."
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alertness.”
The cuts were ultimately hit by combat troops," Panetta said.
“While the wartime contingents in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort,” Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and attitude supervision that support the war."
"Personal salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime dealers and legal as well as political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they published Panetta's letter.
“This is a result that we can’t live with, and it’s certainly not something that should be imposed on us.”
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly blunted the possible cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might be ahead – a military with a shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without matroshens."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
"It's a paperworker, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
“It’s a fighting force that lacks morale and alertness and is not able to take it up with potential opponents.”
"She's really making you angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global operations' ability to deploy and intervene," leading to a warlike inaction.
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle needed by the Army and Navy to replace the Humvee.
If further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but supporters say it is an important next step in arming, so that potential dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to Detach a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy with the accusations of sexual harassment by several women, both sides confronting each other with the lie.
Penn State's management is accused of having detained reports that a retired football coach had sexually abused boys, according to the report.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy told U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violating campaign funding, which is linked to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about foaming in school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have provided their students with the test answers so that they can do well in their performance checks themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and gossip are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies have shown that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are considered to be untrue.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “discovering lies” is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far removed from a social game such as Sharaden, in which the goal is to call "Have you!", the detardment of a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected during the past six decades in Phsych's field and in particular in Phych's field of research, which has been collected in the field of Universities, in particular, in the field of physology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths about lying have been unraveled.
Lies look one in the eye.
They don’t always stutter, stutter, blush, and sneeze.
However, it cannot be concluded that these lies are difficult to uncover and uncover.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, which fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of detachment. And it is clear that the detachment of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding proper answer in our complex world. Especially when listening to detachment or detachment.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men more often "self-orientated" lies than women, whose lies are more "orientated on others" - usually they want to "protect the feelings of others" - that married people are less likely to lie than their partners.
We also know that when a person is debunked as a villain, others feel less guilty about having lied to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their test person.
You should know better when someone is usually constantly tripping with the foot, so that they don’t falsely accuse them of tripping with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as proof of detachment.
People who cheat may stare when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the interview", when all are in the deep, tense, distracting.
Questioning often incorrectly signals that a job interview is over, only to look after this relaxation after the job interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson’s scout is famous for using the past form when he claimed his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question altogether.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... in best knowledge and conscience."
As a result, the answer becomes more perceptive than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to scream.
There is no magic tool to detach lies, but you can learn skills that make detachment possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a victim of scammers, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline to be revised after endangered by delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, angering trade unions and at the same time reassuring environmentalists, the company building the pipeline can be re-engineered to re-plan the project.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be rerouted from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament Building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of reviewing the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply, was reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review, ordered by the foreign ministry, may delay a decision by 2013, following the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the U.S. State Department and said he supported it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline was connecting Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s legislators who are against the plan weigh the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ impact on the environment has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the chief auditor of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing a toddler out of fear to break
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a tob search attack that would have frightened her little daughter so much that she gave in to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
“Someone came after me and said, ‘You know what your daughter is doing?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and went to take her back on her arm,” she said.
LaBelle reminded the pregnant woman furiously.
“She said in an aggressive tone: ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’”
She became angry and began to shiver - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started licking water from the bottle at me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” said the child’s mother.
LaBelle crashed on the mother, who still wore Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her escort and pulled into a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby was screaming so much that it had to give up, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family apologized in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The lawsuit is about an unspecified compensation, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he doesn't charge a fee and plans the family to donate the money they receive to child cancer relief.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is put on a nursery who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm.”
Climate resistance slows down the economy
In the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labor rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, who called himself the initiator of change and gave great hopes about economic growth, is indicative of the government. However, because of the climatic resistance, the variances of the economy can not be divided.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the millions in height in agriculture, but also placed close limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year. This is due mainly to the broadening of the economy, the decline of the historical 31st century.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were farmed and the remaining 21.07 percent were harvested.
The decline in the number of people employed in the Mexican state has increased steadily since the fall in economic activity69 in September. The Instituto Nacional de Estad<0xC3><0xAD>stica y Geograf<0xC3><0xAD>a observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, as from January to March, there was a rapid increase in unemployment.
Less liquidity
According to Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Aut<0xC3><0xB3>noma (UAS), the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the rising unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts due to the legislation that is investing in the fight against money laundering in Congress," he said, "it is too much for those who are not allowed to work for money laundering, because it is too much for those who are not allowed to do it."
The migration has stopped
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that rising unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due on the one hand to immigration problems and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here, which is rising unemployment," he said.
Black Workers
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult given the high proportion of black labour, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of the workers in the country who work without having to pay in the social security funds.
Unemployment and black labor are low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a del Trabajo y Previsi<0xC3><0xB3>n Social (Governmental Authority for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September; this is much less than the overall national average of 7375 pesos.
Decreased ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded. According to the Secretariat of the Economy (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to $31,630,597 for the period from January to June.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Desarrollo Econ<0xC3><0xB3>mico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) in turn recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly coming from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis, the national government applied at the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which was to be invested in the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The National Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but could not determine the positive impact of the economy in the country until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first year of government Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdé’s incapacity to govern made obvious.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, Chairman of the C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n (State Chamber of the Processing Industry in Mexico) said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to work twice. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well-aligned government teams have been sufficiently agreed upon," he said.
Slow economic development <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year hampered and slowed the economic development of the country.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowing economy that is not moving enough to produce an economic dynamic that will result in an acceptable flow of our processes, products and services", we could not produce that over the years.
Re-define a call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana (business association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, declared that the state should be encouraged to develop more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a perspective for the future that drives the government’s efforts in better ways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, what I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010 by Mexican military officers in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez Road, opposite guard No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white delivery van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack on the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the district judge and the punishment remains in the execution facility.
Debt for construction work
The programmes Habitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 social structures for migrants are in danger of being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The head of the city’s social development authority stated that, although the construction programs have already advanced, they are now at risk as the state government has not paid the funds available to it, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell on the state, so far only the Federaci<0xC3><0xB3>n and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction is expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To not be too late, we have already started with the construction work, and they have already progressed far, but we have already done that."
He pointed out that under the government of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla the state had failed to meet its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which corresponds to the amount that the central government should have paid.
"We had already done this in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient financial resources, and the programs continued and this year we had to acquire the funds that the state had not spent to participate in these programs," he said.
Even though the state authorities are obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , was asked to speed up the administrative work and pay off the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“Almost 12 million of them have to contribute, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny.”
The court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) pointed out the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by virtue of which the switch from analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be postponed, due to the lack of eight votes, which are back to law enforcement.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, were of the opinion that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued the legislative decree with the details of the switch to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order for the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the draft of the complaint, drawn up by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, since for the regulations relating to radio and television, the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications) would be responsible here.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted in favour of the project themselves.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree-Law, after the adoption of the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and stopped all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies without taking part in the debate on the project, for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures that the public administration should take by general regulations.
"I also do not believe that doing so would impair the independence of the regulatory body." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because the central government is responsible for managing this.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
Delaying the shift, she said, is a postponement of the use of digitalization, which is a decision of public interest that has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she emphasized, "required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic leadership by the state, they contained a set of features that placed the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, namely the government, although they had highly specialized facilities.
One cannot conclude that the government would intervene in the powers of Congress with the issue of the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballot in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
The possibility of the individual counting of the ballot is a reality in the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections is almost 27 percent.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that it was on 9 November that the constituency had a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in Wahla.
It should be recalled that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n had neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice adapted to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that these had not entered into force in this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel had not considered it necessary to enter into the Arguen, avoiding their publication in the Stague.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature and judged the state commissioner’s vote on the constitutional reforms as “invalid and unlawful” since he has no right to “decide or veto.”
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal stated in an interview on the possibility of counting the votes in detail that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, it was now possible for the local electoral authority to count the ballot in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not actually present or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious changes in the opinion of the committee.
In addition, the total count of the fully completed ballots may take place if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in the second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request of the party.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after the completion of the proper calculation, it is found that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that it is counted out an explicit request from a representative of the party who would have been appointed.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second places is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of 923 electoral records have not yet been counted.
His last will.
Its ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés looted this Sunday night on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the dead show and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the colonel's last will was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila in a plane of the Mexican Air Force.
At twelve o’clock in the afternoon, the Colonel’s ashes landed in the mourning hall on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where his family and friends arrived.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, where he was attended by his former technical alumni and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparations for the high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he lived in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n Air Force, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck, yet he always strived to make his dream of becoming a pilot come true.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that he had even driven to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n for his family’s graduation at the age of seven, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A Last Farewell
The lieutenant-colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honors under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez. His honor was granted to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military front, the military frontier of Salutia and the military frontier.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which also Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority, crashed.
At 18.05 hours, the frozen remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, met to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, at the front of the barracks, where he and his family members, Angina and his followers, Franda, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned body was found on a property on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the fund, members of the military presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots in different parts of the body and a pardon shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The event took place at 1.5 kilometres of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood wide.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three feet further inside, which they immediately communicated to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
Nearly a meter away, the body of another person was lying in a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to local information, the three people must have been killed in another location, as no cartridge cases were found.
On the wall of the country house there are inscriptions that write one organized criminal gang to another, as well as several incisions in the wall and door were found.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defence) presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal proceeding that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who were brought with abductions, murder, halconeo (human hunt) and secret burials.
According to public information, eight people were first arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on November 11 and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured and the detainees confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
At 6 a.m. on November 12, soldiers found a car without a number plate with two inmates on their guard in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, at 2 p.m. on November 13, one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who, while watching the military, attempted to seize the escape.
You will be charged with secret attachments in General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse is supposed to offer.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse is supposed to offer.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of a government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on forming a government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well-placed," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by Euro politicians in order to regain the broken trust in Italy.
The pressure on Monti’s rush was heightened by the fluctuating market situation, which resulted in Italy’s government bonds being charged with 7% interest for 10 years, which is in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government as much as possible."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Montis’s chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to step down as a result of the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to bring good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government that is mostly technocrats, which is just forming Monti.
Support from the Parliament
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the repulsion of the reforms could again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its note that a failure of Montis is a disaster, also exerts pressure.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women’s organisations.
The session is scheduled to be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After brief breaths towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister has again reached critical limits on the costs of Italian government bonds.
Rescuing Italy with a debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government would have to last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
The Spaniards have more games than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players recalled from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the buckle.
From the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 invited 50 games is behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendly game, which takes place today at 3.05 p.m. at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champion, the number one on the FIFA Monthly Ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-color team has only the defending player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated knockout games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international meetings within the framework of the Concacaf, which is listed on the FIFA rankings at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (Lost 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games reached an equaliser with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will set a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder of Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
The number one hundred also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side stormer J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and the stormer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games in the Spanish team include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
From the sides of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of us are not even close to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one in Costa Rica and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica on its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
More than 20 years they have been expected, but the band assures them that a dream will come true when they play in Costa Rica.
The group’s bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, assured Viva of an exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the interview, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been on vacation in Costa Rica once. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It’s exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely surrendered and they experience the days before the concert more intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry for taking so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a couple of huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we like to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are fascinated by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends have always been surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent surfing area. In this way, about people who love surfing, we learned about it.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there, we don’t set any limits.
We will try to give the best show possible with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You will never repeat your repertoire.
- Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everyone likes a different song, so the decision we’re each going to play isn’t easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven’t played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they might be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that’s why it’s also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us have imagined playing in a great rock band once, even for over 20 years.
We continue to rely on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like it and are excited about making music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be any better.
What did it mean for you to have been actively involved in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are well friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Time and again a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and proud to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are excited to still be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago, which alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate the happiness of being still alive and, moreover, we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One's familiar with the other and his music, and we couldn't be better off.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy; on the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought into being, without being a famous rock star, which has never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great in the beginning.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed about what it took so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what kind of an incredible person Andy was about and how he always made me laugh.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore have chosen the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas live has to offer. That's definitely going to be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Eddie Vedder, I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that happens to him.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
So many <0x2B>
The first ones I like include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it was no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better than ever.
At first, her music was darker, now she is more positive.
- Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little lightweight, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
Both of them came to me with tears when I heard Ed play them. They're very dark songs.
I believe that as you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, if you lose a family member or a friend – that influences your artistic creation and your music and these two songs embodies that clearly for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was taken to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his GP said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his tenure (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including lung cancer, which has been operated on and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl<0xC3><0xA1>sicas Hospital in Peru to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that Fujimori's opinion could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He had surgery on lung cancer four times and lost 18 kilograms of weight, including other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been in custody since September 2007 at the Direcci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la polic<0xC3><0xAD>a.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official meeting, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the highlight of his timetable with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s support regarding the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and since January this year there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid duplication with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretization of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s "grey list" of countries that do not have all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The string-bearing installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which will be coming to stores all over the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which can be played without a special three-dimensional spectacle.
"Mario is the figure who has to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the head of the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain, said at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was " Nintendo's first video game to be developed for this console from the outset", because so far, successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson stressed that while it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "expensive" video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip to the three-dimensional world of Super Marios also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success in the latest editions: The string-barred installer must overcome dangerous platforms to liberate Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees portillos delivery to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would hold the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo responsible for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy in the United States.
The trial ends with the US request for the extradition of Portillo, so that he can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his administration, he had not interfered in court decisions and had issued any extradition requests he had been notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n, Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, are being extradited for murder and serious bodily injury.
The Coloms Act is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the defeat of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign, which preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: In this quarter-century, 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion were helped to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, a balance sheet was drawn up at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which over 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginalization.
At last night’s celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous officials from institutions and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years took part.
Participation of political representatives of different directions at election campaign times proved the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the General Director of the Social Work of the La Caixa Savings Bank, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that the present times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house, where giant parties were held, was cleared
The owners of the house had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street (Barcelona).
The twelve house occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbours of the house No. 51 on Balmes Street have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair, the evacuation was carried out on judicial order without police intervention.
After the clearance, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house administrator confirmed.
The house occupants, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, and they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the house crew.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the homeowners made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while these in the discotheque cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the recreation area had been shown by the neighbors due to rest disturbance, while according to her statement the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the house occupants and especially by the guests of the parties, which were always organized there, and who according to the statements of the angry neighbors.
The head of the discotheque stated that the harassment had been so great that it was agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Urban Police) also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbours in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the city council of Barcelona, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had last week called for the building to be cleared immediately and to get to grips with the problems of civic coexistence as well as the demise of the neighborhood.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the house occupants had advanced in all floors of the building and almost all the apartments, in some there had even been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the social actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris neighborhood was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched as four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees, agree to the tender.
The city’s call for proposals for the 16 gates will reopen the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappearing Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its smear on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in the city of Barcelona.
It was even compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park again became the upper boundary of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountain) and down (meer).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The role model was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
So far it was when the city issued a giant tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone intends to put doors on the ground.
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old-fashioned caste, meeting in the elevator, can draw on.
And precisely this fact offers the substance for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n "it is necessary", after the attack on the coast, to talk about the "front on the mountain", insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which is about the green apples, has not been carried out.
“It should be assumed that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, according to the architect, for whom the title "Tor of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one must not imagine it "as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas in which to trade."
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as an “intellectual challenge” that carries “some dangers”.
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty involved in the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swanengesang" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation on what can be built.
“To limit something always means to set the next step,” i.e. to exceed it.
"One has to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, simplifies the view that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "be on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment on".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the letter of guidance that allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should be the multidisciplinary teams called into existence ("just be the right one," he says, "lead one."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, since the tendering conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain-sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective in his view of the cross-sectional area."
This, at least in his case, led him to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, creating a soft transition between the city and the green zones.
Casino gives away Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red representative freed the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the trial, which is being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is released after being pardoned by the Casino Red’s attorney before the District’s Second Criminal Court, which is conducting the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the owner of the Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money in order for the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the sentencing, the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained at this location for 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico had dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's detention facility for allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos, but he only stayed a few hours in the medium security tract as he posed murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as a prisoner of the San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza city prison.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the district, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, handed him an arrest warrant, stating that after the nearly two-month investigations, enough evidence was presented to Jona<0xC3><0xA1>s to be able to plead guilty for the payment of this 1.5 million pesos in lieu of the estate.
On Monday, Casino Red’s deputy, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to pass the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico assigned to the court, Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked whether he had repaired the damage and which of the owner of the house had pronounced his pardon, but the lawyer withheld the name.
According to case No. 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released, and no objections to the proceedings can be raised in the following cases, and no damages will be claimed.
After hearing the representative of the House of Commons at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, drove to the San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza city jail to inform Jonas that he had been acquitted and that his case would be put on record.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come reveals details of the plane crash in which Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven other people were killed.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people may have been killed, pointing out that one of the helicopters was directly hit by a sledgehammer.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 meters altitude, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it fulfilled all the requirements for the transportation of the personnel.
He also said that during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down, no helicopter parts were found.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is preferable to obtain the results of the study as soon as possible, however, these may take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter flew from the Estado Mayor Presidential during the crash with travel speed and the plane fell to a soft wing.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the collision."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, included six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Sightseeing:
In accordance with flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of sight flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient sight during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions :
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, some deep-hanging clouds erupted.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact point:
The collision coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter match. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route before the collision.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft wreckage suggests that the helicopter had crashed into the ground with its intact structure.
No indication of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft do not allow fire or explosion to occur at the site of the accident.
The latest results of the investigation suggest several contacts on the ground.
During the on-site investigations, parts of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is slippery and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter was likely to have broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a minutiously search of an area that went beyond the locked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unconfirmed aircraft structure was bumped against the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Discover the Gene for Obesity
The Social Insurance Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are linked to overweight.
Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, Head of the Unit of Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Médica en Bioqu<0xC3><0xAD>mica (Department of Medical Research, focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of physicians, nurses and nurses had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud P<0xC3><0xBA>blica (INSP) and the Centro de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the IMSS sports grounds in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8am.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports court of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and has been continuing since October 8 at the sports court of Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt (in the east of the state of México).
If the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will be continued at the Independencia Sports Square (in the south of the capital district) and completed at the Morelos Sports Square (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors in Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he said, it will be aimed at 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of six and 14 to fill in dietary questionnaires with their consent and under the supervision of their parents.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of illness to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further concluded that on the aforementioned Saturdays the subjects measured (weight, size, waist circumference), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trial identification of fetuses in relation to genes) would be bested.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez emphasized that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys showed that in just six years, the proportion of obese boys has increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent, and obesity has also increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist said.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican is 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African-American, reflecting the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn out the excess energy (calorie) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants consisted of a comprehensive study of children that would determine whether they were overweight or obese.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (acanthose), which indicate the likelihood of pre-existing metabolic disorders and diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and propose to them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there would be three fundamental factors responsible for overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the television and using means of transport instead of going to full lengths.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the number of signs that come from the road surface were taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 impact holes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico) were to break out, he said.
In his lecture on "Technical Holes", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, which, however, never has a greater mechanical resistance at such a temperature.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera believed that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behavior of road surfaces and thus avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthens.
The asphalt's elasticity means that at high temperatures of almost 180<0xC2><0xB0> C. it behaves like a liquid, at 120<0xC2><0xB0> C. it is very tensile and at 50<0xC2><0xB0> C. it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly had a flexible road covering, consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the top layers is a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles continue to move on and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," the chemical engineer said.
“Over the wear layer,” he said, “a last layer will be laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
The road surface receives and distributes most of the forces, the support layer also needs a suitable thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
Weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water,” he said, “because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets wet, water penetrates into the layer and only hardly exits. This causes a softening of all the layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of impact holes.
If a punch hole is created, he said, "the cover layer will first be worn off, while the wear layer will only be impaired afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the appearance of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in proportion to the recessed load of the vehicle, and it must be safe to say that it is in proportion to the recessed load of the vehicle.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the impact holes could be repaired easily and without using high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle wins his 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty at the awarding of the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium, show off a silver crown and the band she presents as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena (1989) Concétali (1989), Alphale Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico took the crown and the cedar, Mary comes to 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands (1990s), Olena (1990s), Ella (1990s), Ella (1990s), Ella (19s), Ella (19s), Elsa (19s), Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa), Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, Elsa, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, El, I.
The big question that many are asking themselves today is: what was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the demise of a great favorite who at every show had shown that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been chosen to be the Queen of the Police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, received by Haustali, who also received titles after Kroengas and the Misbiens with the Korone Queens of Varna Nali.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury’s decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question “What book has influenced you most and why?” asked her by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it’s a way of civilizing myself, eventually I think that the book that most strongly influenced my childhood, ‘The Little Prince’, is a pretty deep-seated book.
I am currently reading <0x60>Culpture and Reconciliation'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called <0x60>Passions'.
A response that encountered little reluctance, first because of the term “civilizing oneself” and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each of the books she mentioned had influenced her.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit of 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favorite who had housed all the cases and had received all the prizes in advance (Easter gastronomy competition, public vote on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "the king did not envy the other candidates, who were jealous of the other candidates."
And this was noticed during her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and during her two lifts at the coronation ceremony.
Although she acted securely with both, she lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" on the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition will eventually not become Queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the assembly of the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had collaborated on projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle, with her defects of the derriere and the fibrosis that had been noticed in the stomach area, had sinned. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for <0x60>natural beauty' with a healthy body of work, good eating habits.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with fibrosis on the abdomen, which was hardly noticeable for me, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos is of the opinion that the woman from Valle del Cauca’s fault was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to get them done properly.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her.”
Due to this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the swimsuit, a cruel prediction was made, which was to come true in the night. It was rumored that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to allow her to enjoy the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that from now on Melina will enter her year of rule, not as a queen but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, as one of the queens, who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown, she will go down in history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a Lophoscopist of the State Prosecutor’s Office’s Investigation Unit (CTI) from Cali went on as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia).
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI’s department, this week, Elias Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had a stand-by service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in communities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is exposed to friction, i.e. the hands and feet.
In the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Elijah was instructed to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night, he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was supposed to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who led the world's oldest guerrilla could have been, so he was supposed to take the ten-finger print of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
However, when he reached the spot where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, for this resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Elijah compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this Puerto Tejada-born man was in charge of informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that it was in fact the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a dactyloscope from the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
At the time of their arrest, many criminals present false IDs or do not have any.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the event of a theft, he had to tear a piece of a wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand at this exact point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprints, but in this case, we were able to take the fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the perpetrator who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by snail bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is still associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or band is used for taking.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the criminal database, or to the personal office.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without ID cards,” the CTI expert said.
He said not everything was as it would be portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But still, it can be used if a corresponding comparison is made.
The "empires" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents at Zuccotti Square.
A large part followed the clearance order and moved its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried again with a court order to enter Manhattan Square after being cleared of the square in the early hours of the morning and attempted to occupy another seat at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Zuccotti Square, where they met with a court order that allowed the "importees" to gain access to the new tent at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement was forced into the parking lot.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray argued that the response of the "empires" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and banning the demonstrators.
In addition, the "Empörten" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that, police came in and arrested some of the demonstrators, even though Bray could not give exact numbers. He assured the Efe news agency that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization said hundreds of people had found themselves at this point, where a religious leader had also arrived as a sign of their support to the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed pending a court hearing, which is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the clearance that took place at dawn is to be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed them, even giving them to some police officers who were guarding the square, resulting in "small clashes", as Bray reported, who had indicated, some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg has made it clear to the press that due to this court order, the reopening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to re-enter them with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation of Zuccotti Square in the early morning, at which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violate the law."
Bloomberg said he had given the order to clear the square because it had "turned into a place where people didn't come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people's privacy" because "some businesses would have had their lives threatened".
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers," the spokesperson added, accusing the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
Occupy Wall Street officials said they are considering organising “big actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that have been running since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary on the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1 in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit on "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crown" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1 in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will take on a very special Virgin Mary's life.
CTV today distributed images of the television program, in which Anderson - also for the spread on the Internet of self-directed porn, in which she along with her ex-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears - as Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap, depicting Jesus in the lap.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" as a Jesus child, appears.
CTV’s Christmas program focuses not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had described North American Kim Kardashian as a "hure".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that plunged into a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced since World War II.
The first estimates by the government in Tokyo estimated the property damage at $300,000, a blow that appears to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the fall by 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable growth.
Nevertheless, the actual shift in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian shocks, which use the crisis to build or rebuilt infrastructure.
Japan is awakened, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increasing spending on vehicles, travel and recreational activities.
The stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee currencies" of investors who fled the eurozone debt crisis and cloudy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that loads like a gravestone on the accounts of exports.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid revaluation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The prospects are really not very upsetting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most Member States had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the turning points of the world economy, showed that the brakes would have been pulled at the greatest economic potentials.
Because it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is 100, after it has dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again.
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widening uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly evidenced by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days of his appointment may not be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party, Daesch, assured the newly elected leader of the Democratic Party, forma, Antonis Formaras.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, to reform disciplinary law for officials and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara's communication does not clear the doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The Conservative leader went too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs, making it clear that he would not accept a commitment to meet the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreou referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties could not sign such a "unambiguous agreement."
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" would return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what was needed for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million euros.
The Greek knot has threads for a while.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized Spain’s “dominant” position regarding this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of the smallest financing".
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, Spain has developed into the second donor of this international cooperation fund in the world. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice" based on people's action in the hope of a better future.
So yesterday the Queen inaugurated the fifth world summit on small loans in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" for a day to "come from a few to the number of people by the United Nations, to the number of people by 2015, to the number of millennials he will have to do".
Spain "continues to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions guaranteed by the summit, which lasts until Thursday, "will be based on the hurdles of the summit and in particular on the hurdles of the summit, and on the creation of the next chapter.
"We have achieved many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The Summit on Small Credit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for launching “two fundamental goals”.
By the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and 10 million of these households will go beyond the poverty line, the Queen said.
The concept of minimum credit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path "initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago" which Queen Sofia considers an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this funding instrument as a "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy locally.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we have been able to observe a continuous further development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project "prepared" her as a "Vallabra" in yesterday.
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her talk by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that the minimum credit is a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of industrialized states should now work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, the minimum loans are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, deplored "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always in front of closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, said the <0xC3><0x96><0xC3><0xB5>y<0xC3><0xAD>st of those present "will come to a city.
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the EU on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig passed for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but in the autumn it worked out, in particular to provide enough for those activists who regard government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's proposal for a Presidency proposed by the Bureau was accepted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, with ten abstaining.
The several-minute standing ovation, which was initially due to the intervention of Angela Merkel and a few hours later of Wolfgang Schäuble, left no doubt open to the three finance ministers who were drawn to Europe.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the appeal - carries the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a revision of the Treaty of Lisbon, which strengthens the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also be in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote, 'to give Europe a face'.
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which Wolfgang Schäuble Pate clearly stood.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Gross Britain is facing the issue repulsively, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates, by an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal to weigh each country on the Governing Council in accordance with the weighting of individual economies, which obviously meant a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned with reassuring the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately receive Germany.
Insofar as the European application dedicates a paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent when it comes to health reports?
After the family aid, UMP and the government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a family aid fund and to talk about the issue of combating social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the effort to put the economy to a hard test, but on the other hand is no less a pretext for an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health reports.
First of all, with a budget objective: the government intends to introduce a fourth quarantine day before taking into account an illness report for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose his four-day salary without the permission of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A move that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help bring in 280 million euros.
And this was accompanied by a more symbolic nature: to grant the public officials an unpaid carentz day in the case of illness (so far, unlike the three carentz days in the private sector, there is no carentz period for them).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority is also recasting the fraud theme, this time focusing on the abuse associated with the absence of work.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and beyond that, they must be repaid if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, ahead of RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports seems a bit disproportionate.
In fact, it has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives that have borne the most common fruit.
The French are no more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
First, let’s look at the country-wide figures.
According to the state health insurance company CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily payments were paid out in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health Care, the daily savings in 2008 amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion, accounting for 5% of health expenditure.
This amount was 46% for maternity leave as well as work accidents and 54% for sick leave, which is 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French received an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that blurs certain differences: Another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed indicated they had not taken a single day of illness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, found that 37% of health reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months, and 11% over.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are therefore less likely to be incapacitated than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenteeism rate (founded by disease or otherwise 18) oscillated in 1 and 16% respectively in the Kingdom of France, ranging from 10% to 11% in 10% and 21% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in case of sick reports represents a disappearingly small proportion in terms of black work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak exhaustion is achieved here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks in case of illness reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College of Education and Training of Technicians and Engineers) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term health reports realized, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days duration, among the 1.2 million 11% of "unfit or unjustified" cases, that is, 132,000.
In total, this amounts to 169,000 "unjustified" cases of several million workers who have claimed a disease report.
A figure that represents only a weak variance with respect to, for example, that of black labour.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax gains per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore significantly more than the amount of fraud.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to catch up with its economy.
This had been announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament on Monday, November 14, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme to adjust the budget," the Head of Government said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the Eurozone was "on the play", he added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos planned to reduce the country's state deficit "by 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Refuses the New Savings
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had on Monday given his consent to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but sent ahead that his party would not be prepared for an additional withdrawal.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a House of Representatives of his party New Democracy.
He had declared himself ready to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight waste, but he was opposed to any policy that would prevent the economic boom.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of more than 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned repression, said Antonio Samaras would not have responded.
Euthanasia and associated freedom must be legalized, according to an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians were working together to provide the best painkillers for pain management, and this also goes beyond the cancer cases.
The Canadian society is living in a denial attitude towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually allow themselves to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, interconnected in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the Penal Code in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice occurs, namely in patients who are deemed to be able to make such a decision.
As a start, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the globe.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that "medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the overwhelming desire of Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of those in the hospital eventually die.
From all over the country, the rate of hospitalized deaths in Quebec is highest with 86%.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that the position of the federal government, which has already pledged to make no changes to the penal law concerning euthanasia and accompanying suicide, is to be taken into account.
Now, however, according to the experts, who have inspected all those countries whose approach euthanasia and associated suicide have legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would not lead to misconduct in their application, i.e., the practice of euthanasia or decriminalization would not be carried out by target persons.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, in a teleconference.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
“Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although here it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
We are aware that according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already accrued in favor of euthanasia, as they believe that these allowed people at the end of their lives to mitigate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
In terms of individuals who have already committed an accomplice suicide, 41% of respondents feel that they should not be prosecuted.
As for maintaining or discontinuing the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the cessation of the means for which a legal refusal was made should not be considered a criminal offence.
The expert panel also calls for health care professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the cessation of funds at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians were working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving treatments, and this also goes beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, with regard to the remedies already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the panel calls for pain relief or life-saving measures to be taken into account, at least because they did not consider these as much as euthanasia and were used to reduce physical scars.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made reservations with regard to the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the report-signing experts "extreme", among other things, as this does not set any limits on euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door for a situation where anyone who is tired of living and over 18 years of age is asked to help another person in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility over all other values involved in society’s social activism.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts the reports regarding the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus launches a "complot"
Syria Is Isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the authorities of the Auben Ministry yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, which is resisting this, thanks to Russia’s support and a “conspiracy” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria was expelled by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, had taken a position in favour of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the current Arab Prime Minister yesterday, who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to “set down his official power in Syria”, in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
“If Bashar was keen on his country’s interest, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbour, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has complained that Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must go," he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is constantly taking a harsher stance.
The United States, in turn, welcomed the “strengthening of the consensus against Assad as well as the actions of the Syrian regime” as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government’s power were killed in the Dar’a region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH said.
According to this NGO, two more civilians were killed in "shocks and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim was nevertheless of the opinion that the country "steers towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted with emphasis on the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a “dangerous step”.
“Syria will not yield,” he added, under the implication, “the forged plots against Syria would fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a “protection mechanism for civilians” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of sending UN observers to support civilians against the regime’s repression that encapsulated him in its “paranoia”, protecting him.
An over-planned reunion of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the crisis exit, but in particular the controversial, anticipated withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detainees.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision yesterday “incorrect” in order to guard against the endorsement of possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to recover the credit lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the current President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, had hoped to wait for Mario Monti to give parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation of a draft list presented by Mr Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he underlined that it is "sure that the markets will show themselves dull and reasonable".
His order by the president was initially applauded by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister in office was to establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had emphasized that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the confidence of parliament by Friday.
Since taking office, Monti has committed himself to working urgently with the aim of making Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the savings it has been making in recent months, has called in particular for new hard-hitting measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy’s chief of staff, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, “as a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficit figures”.
Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epochal change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the lead author.
The big unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent pre-election, as Italy will have to come up for 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-usable explosive capsule, an American NGO that specializes in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The ISIS Institute of Science and International Security is based on the recently published report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
The IAEA announced its "serious concern" last week on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, who was born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s.
He is said to have left the center in 1989 or 1991 to set up a company in Kiev that manufactures "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA cited "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosives system "was supported by the work of a foreign expert, who not only immigrated to this technology in the first place, but also, as a member of the state of Kagen, had militarily immigrated to this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either declined slightly or have increased slightly in the same period, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, up 49%, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a global increase in anti-Semitism of 14%.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak Mave, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
“After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again,” Human Rights First said. “The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First had long emphasized that violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the organization’s chief executive officer.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving police attitudes toward “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" is a legacy in American federal law from the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or ancestry and now also involving crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is increasingly similar to Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their posts, which once again makes the service similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users, whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who track your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August at a small percentage of users," Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told French news agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with something esoterisch anmutendem Wortlaut (RT zum referenzierten Wiederholen der Beiträge einer anderen Person). followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opening to a wider audience with a more comparable Google<0x2B> handling of the public than the Facebook network.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" over the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive, and very similar to Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
"The 'Activity' feature will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux tweet," Dannykronstrom said.
Austria-Hungary
Incorporation of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to reduce any degradation on the part of the top rating agencies.
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who personally announced this decision of the departure of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian state debt is at 74.6%, i.e. far above the criterion set out by the Maastricht Treaty of Lüttich, as well as the change of 60% of Spain, but clearly and Italy.
“If Austria’s solvency had not fallen to a blow from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros of interest every year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democrat minister of auxiliaries.
Austria is also making a request for the Brussels Summit of the Eurozone Member States on 26 October: Heads of State or Government would then have the introduction of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the balance of public accounts.
The action taken by the Austrian government in this regard is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, as from 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas the regional states as well as the municipalities should compensate.
The objective is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement by 2020/21.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again in the currency markets should the yen continue to rise.
“If we were to determine an excessive volatility” in the exchange rate of the yen, we would intervene just as we did last time,” Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again accelerating close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold the yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which is about to set a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has steadily risen above it, dubbed by purchases by investors who view the yen as a “refugee” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro slipped under the symbolic lattice of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This rush of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it costs the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as these convert them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region," said Noda, who fears that this upheaval of the yen could kill the weak upsurge already in the keim.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter- for the first time this year, has regained traction again thanks to the booming export growth and consumption of the households "plugged" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the value of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to deter the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, said the BoJ had already launched "appropriate measures" to allege that there would be no additional currency lockdown on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its purchases of government bonds by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) that it had spent on various purchases of financial market securities.
Eurozone:
Interest rates go up fast, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infecting the debt crisis constantly unterminated the European key figures.
Despite the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise steadily.
Stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little further into negative fields on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, and London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions regarding the yields of government bonds in the eurozone in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to release some of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and are only too aware of the risk of infection,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fears of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a fall of 0.7%.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is detrimental to the single currency, which continues its bait on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it declined by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it has resigned after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had met in Congress on Monday, made a request that in particular provides for the possibility of countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without at the same time comparing the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% threshold.
Loan interest rates in Italy and Spain continue to be at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, while the yield of Spanish bonds rose to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investor fears.
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, called for more time from the markets to recover the situation threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October was “the main task” of his government.
Spain is in the forefront of the markets, as the parliamentary elections are taking place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
In anticipation of Eurozone growth figures
Statistically speaking, France booked an economic growth carried by household consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, ergo a little better than expected 0.3%.
However, the INSEE Federal Statistical Office had revised the decline in the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it’s the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, had an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The eurozone is expected to be raised at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts Should Win Over Dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, then this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of the companies.
It makes sense to initiate an election meeting, to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it probes the totality of the economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population shouldn’t have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute alternative source, nor in Switzerland, which is currently planning to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, in turn, decided to rejoin its park after Fukushima by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which was discontinued after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is geared towards renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of a taxation of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, particularly from Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a reason for reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in terms of wind energy, from which it accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on this basis, its CO2 emissions as well as its average value correspond to 50% of the euro electricity price by 6 per cent.
Thanks to the resilience of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French households.
As the energy price plays a key role in the globalised economy in terms of competitiveness and the stability of industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in energy prices, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are as willing to pay as little as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We are aware that our country’s energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a myriad of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France made the decision to step out of nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion of annual exports of investment goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to operate for sixty years if the downturn of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation one must admit that there is as little as a devil's work a miraculous means of generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that performs uncompromising and transparent checks in existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are obsessed with the security notion.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major disruptions.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was aggravated by reactor construction as well as innocence, human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and the cooperation of the French and German nuclear power plant operators and designers of the safety authorities, the EPR presents a design that allows it to be resilient to such phenomena.
As it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by leaving them free track, the leading position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is imperative and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to have emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation as well.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a number-subject policy, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment against foreign students on the official side had marked the weekly shows, the interior minister had casually announced (see Liberation of May 23) that France "no need for talents, murals or waiters from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a wide-ranging consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
From the right, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "could not take on all the poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of coercion.
The fear of invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish Klempners was shared by both the right and left in 2005.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of cruelty one is willing to admit to the immigrant.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to trivialities that point to partnership development that allow us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present to us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p.
Restricting immigration would discourage growth and harm the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace local workers, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience has shown that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they practice hard-core jobs in sectors that are technically unencumbered by the workplace.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage workers, which are more qualified among immigrants working in dynamic sectors where training is not suitable for employment.
Positive Remuneration Effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in the flow of immigrants will result in a related long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants is conducive to economic growth (a high proportion of immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in European countries on average at around 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will make an average net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to make the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
These said teeth, which should deter immigrants, however, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to rethink European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has had the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonists in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible to see democracy defeat its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon the "Little" that this was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become as well an “instrument of oppression” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it back then.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of forces, an education, education, an economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe, where we are, is an economic crisis, but it is just as much, and above all, a political and democratic crisis.
The change in attitude of the Greek truth-false referendum would have had a double revealing character in this respect: on the one hand, the need for a powerful return to politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, of their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organized in a proper order and depending on the needs.
A free rein for the European sole ruler or a leap into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hacking, but a collective task, rightly, clarified and consistently, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, you don't know where to end the list - since there is only one crisis, and this is prevailing in Europe.
It is all Europe that bows to the dictates of markets and rating agencies that suffer from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is all of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and therefore each of the nations that belong to it.
The urgency is to give people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
The question is whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and build a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic legality, without causing us to ruin.
After this proposal was fought for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, today everyone is pushing the European economic leadership to do so.
Agreed.
But if this were to be imagined without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it pretentious to the citizens - it would be another madness and another dead end.
We need to take a new stage of European construction on us.
In order to create the republic in France, it required the fact of "creating" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction will continue to be valid.
We need to create a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become common
On Tuesday, the World’s Fair for Chip Cards opened its doors in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most portable segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining in terms of contactless land payments after long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out their customers bank cards equipped with contactless chips in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
However, this is only a first step on the path to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
So far, a very small percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should experience a real upward trend at least next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also announced yesterday that it would prepare for the launch of an offer that would allow its customers to pay without contact via mobile phones.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected relationship between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now “acquired certainty” about it.
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the relations of the intelligence services indicate clear cooperation," he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
Investigations into the kidnapping of two French women in Niger last January have fueled intersections.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, are said to have been killed on the following days at the same time as several of their abductors on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorist in the debris at the site of the operation.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the conducted phone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: One number leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but there is no doubt more evidence to be expected before we can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.”
"But it's conceivable."
“It has been known for years that the sect is financially and intellectually supportive of Auveen and that Auveen is increasingly active,” said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as have Boko Harem's speeches and modes of operation, which have now been used to attract suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives such as these.
Since then, the International Community, to begin with Washington, has put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the grouping as a community of Illuminati, who need not pay particular attention.
Faster success
Founded in Maiduguri in 2002 around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means as much as "Western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this resourceless region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
It politicizes and demands strict adherence to the Sharia, while its affiliated activists engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The activists have initially targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their intensified attacks against the commissioners.
Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken prisoner, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its high castles in the north.
Last Christmas, she announced an assassination attempt in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place at the secured police headquarters in Abuja – the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been a concern for all security experts ever since.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger to operate the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé had warned Boko Harem in Nigeria on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan and was ready to "communicate all notices".
The world according to the Republican presidential nominees
With Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry competing in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say, intricate ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate in this way, voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-conspirators have repeatedly denied their thunderous statements as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
There are slogans about China, Iran and Israel’s aid – often understated in no way.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney, the highest-ranking party, threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and to expose them to the "currency manipulation" - a leading theme in an America that is aggravated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
It was stupid if it was meant to imply the launching of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost narrowed the air in terms of his emotionally flattering gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also vowed military strikes against Iran if sanctions to halt the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I get elected, I'll give Iran a break," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
In addition, he has promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, in turn brings a shameful file ignorance to the show.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing "attempted to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, in turn, insists on being prepared to deploy the U.S. Army in Mexico against a drug cartel.
The 2009 Obama ban on torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the 2008 Republican candidate, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Against the current presidential counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that even Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine on the subject of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive interlocutor with Iran, the swift withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this attachment is not entirely unenforceable.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security under Obama, who has turned Bin Laden off.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to retaliation.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to rekindle its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to carry out this event with glitter and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly to each other at sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast last Tuesday with orchestral concerts and a fine-tasting buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly rotated the control of the valve that transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first 1,224 km long pipeline that connects the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line on the same track is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this huge building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, while avoiding any trajectory by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the road.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: for them it will now be more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most heavily involved in the debate, had not shied away from comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically highly sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the cost of de-energying European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas supplies are going to decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important on the political and economic side.
All this explains the wide smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas remote line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete casing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, at about 200 m depth.
During its construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be eliminated.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed in a precautionary manner," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line made of metal, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was foreseen off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders refrained from it, as the Swedes were not impressed with seeing a Russian state company permanently settle on the heights of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas leak in less than a minute," explained Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas located in the gas remote line thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers as unlikely, since the welding seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes by a seagoing vessel, and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, has a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and is moved forward by the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides accurate information on any deformations of the metal upon its arrival.
The gas remote line was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2>
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (each up to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French company group GDF Suez (each up to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly inexpensive.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport on an extensible twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how gross the amount of gas that is actually transported falls out," explained Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs are expected to amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment amounted to 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are determined to recover their balance sheets, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline takes place on a sandy, pine-forested coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlet gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, at candlelight with writing added hours.
Moleskine’s notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular ribbon, rubber ribbon, egg-coloured sides, as aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to market a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company’s expert consultant, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton varnish used, for example, for covers of upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of buyers, as the notebook delights businessmen as well as students and professionals alike.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs more than 100 and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centres and agrees to enforce its identity.
“We have followed the spirit of the time and its new need for writing, which exists despite the surge in emails,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural attraction is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour ", in which architects and artists exhibit their own notebooks.
In August, at the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a band with leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of the time and understood how to diversify his products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer envelopes... The brand has the full range of items.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a deliberate public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% of the total population.
Disheartening?
“No,” said <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which is organizing the “Working Week for the Disabled.”
"The progress made in the last 15 years is significant."
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not doubled, but tripled.”
"Nevertheless, there is still a huge amount to be done."
However, it must be said that there are still many obstacles for disabled people before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a bachelor’s degree and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled compared to 38% overall.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter employment and that form the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
It remains the unspoken, the attitudes of the mind, which, although certain, but slowly develop.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Entrepreneurs Association for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had “a weak level of knowledge about disabled people” that “over-represented” was “by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged.”
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating back to 2008, refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now at around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization that is tasked with invoking contributions from companies that violate this law.
Evidence: The number of "paying fees" establishments has decreased from 59.000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011.
“The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, has put a lot of pressure on companies,” explained Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also gives expression to real knowledge, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employ between 20 and 49 employees with disabilities, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesdays (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not spoiled their pleasure, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made good peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures himself.
As for the contrast between his performance in club and national elf"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start".
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought in Friday night against Romania in terms of the match against France to finally "gloss".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to further reinforcing the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he presents.
“We just walked over the road.”
"To be allowed to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, on the other hand, allowed "Stolz" to bend with kindness.
"The Pride of a Galamatch".
"Pride" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbors" - that France"again has become a team at a very high level", and this little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national elf) ... and in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out rough," he stressed.
“We’re planning something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games." The match against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is very optimistic about the return against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the playoffs, both teams had missed the factuality.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national elf, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means in fact only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to win off an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Considering the hint (0-0) on Friday in Zenica's Hell, it seems obvious that the cubes have not fallen yet.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour clearly, but the team was unable to push the thing on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure away from it.
"This is a good result, but it does pose a certain risk, as we have not achieved an outbound goal."
At home, however, in their brightly radiant Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to strike themselves in front of an audience that should be equally hot on the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very tough match, but are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said in a statement.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at the 2012 European Championships," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forced the Portuguese to score a goal and to win.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
“This is a good result, but it does pose a certain risk because we have not achieved an outbound goal,” Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese planned to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset to "give them no time to think".
It is a good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
