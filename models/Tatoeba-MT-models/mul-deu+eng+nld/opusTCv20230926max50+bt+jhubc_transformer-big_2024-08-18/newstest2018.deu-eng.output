Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
It’s an idiotic place to meet young people today.
A pit chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners farm the former grounds of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to the day.
It's annoying when maps aren't up-to-date.
This is known to everyone who had to get excited because the car-navi instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer from the Bavarian geoportal of the state government, are anything but current - but for that very reason very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of Munich’s Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a flickering carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps for cities and communities, so-called origination sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map.
According to the Bavarian Measuring Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first Measuring of Bavaria.
Its client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical reception of Bavaria – of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was the neighbors of today who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measuring Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison before/today is the most impressive example of the capital city.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: In the zoom in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered fluffy pieces from the so-called "reception", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots are no longer there for farmers - but for small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" plant.
A large green area is distinguished north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century – and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet, in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der Fanten" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße, people with delusions were once locked in.
In 1858/59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the interrogation of the so-called idiots.
In addition, he forbade the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has been involved in an exhibition with the institution.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and later it was expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district plant in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, to the east are residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in World War II bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as "main square" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought about a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs smashed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remains to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval grave chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn trunk line will take place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial picture of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored has issued a warning to people of color who travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to make the group pay special attention to it,” the statement said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They will be stopped because of their skin color, they will be beaten or killed,” said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, to the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven’t heard before.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization to a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no more gasoline during the state trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office that shows that black drivers in the state are arrested 75 percent more often than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared whether they bring bail or let relatives know that they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program that rank the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws, requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will be for further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. Department of State to other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Fence Project is Elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of the Schwendemann family at the right-grab court.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest Milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
Only regionals come to the table of the holiday guests.
As he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing project as "elementarly important".
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The green area provides a lot of work, much has to be worked on with the motor sensing.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann said.
In 2003, he took over the parental holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run an organic holding.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the lawn fence project and is pleased with the Leader support".
At a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the forestry of the areas could be pulled out for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
A total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in 2013 through the grazing promotion.
The holding area is thus 40 hectares, which cannot be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half was funded through Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers stayed 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of meadow fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and peasant women it is not possible."
Peter Weiß also stated: “Best food is produced here”.
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) in Baden-Württemberg allows the state to promote lawn fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be trawlable (inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by uprooting.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build a fence of just under 16 kilometres.
The open area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Now the White House is taking over Trump’s Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate them just as much as anyone else – hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their importance, and especially the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller Acosta said, “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is actually right, but as he himself formulated it, it’s not really about history.
It is the contemporary resonance to Lazarus's shocking words, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poor, / your relapse of the oppressed masses, who desire it, free to breathe."
There was never a time when the "ending waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s United States.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus—and her friends, who worked hard to put their words at the base after their death—knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical figurative representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it from the right wing for a long time.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the nightly world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not intended to illuminate the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh came up with something here.
The significance of the statue is a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginary act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful men after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And, of course, that’s not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Its torch is not intended to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred, which is its only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
The UK's athletic performance director, Neil Black, says the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is being developed in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we’re trying to understand it, and we’re going to continue it until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in was great."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it’s “unbelievable” that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships so far was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir is leading this way and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O’Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me,” she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
What is my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to bet on this home support and benefit from the fact that we’re back in the Olympic stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t stand the simmering of voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He sneered at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away – and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people coming to the governor’s side – which is a public forum called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging their tits online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with hatred, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the message broadcast "The Post".
“I also don’t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are being misrepresented by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called a “concentrated spam attack” would likely be called “foreign language.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical leadership articles and burn them, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening digitally.
Hogan isn’t the first public official to be criticized for harassing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell in Virginia last week.
The chairman of Loudoun County’s Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from their Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had an effect similar to that of the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers joined his leadership.
Even then, Washington had an anonymous troll.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that downplayed Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his stance on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, divergence of opinion and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means to accept it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led the archerfield left side to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as the tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we’ll see how it achieves its fame with this event,” Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is an ardent defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a very special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a little more when you’re playing at home,” said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy about how it has gone so far.”
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer death due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died from passive smoking from lung cancer.
To this end, scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come in a study.
“According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking,” said study leader Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At the time, there were another 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany per year.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and are "somewhat in time", according to the head of the building farm Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as much is hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
For the construction group of the company Stumpp, the traffic, which is constantly hampering the construction work, is a big problem.
"The ignorance of the drivers before red lights and roadblocks is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the bus lines are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already very stressful.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cooled cabbage is removed with eager, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5:00 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand raising in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement that rallied for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs that have been transformed into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” Degei says, pointing to her vivid, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
It is also Indonesia’s gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized highland province with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated US$78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuas, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua Tribal Highland in the 1970s were genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We Will Lose Everything" is said in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of previous year's atrocities, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular according to another report.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Locals are fighting to stay here.
“The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
“It has cost the native Papua — the mama [women] of Papua — their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations of the law in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You said.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took a kick at their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drunk hunted and beat the group with their pistols, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance – running around the circle and imitating a bird’s song – by Papua’s Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began smuggling stones at police and military posts.
When the mood warmed up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," it said in an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the menacing danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist,” he told TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots fired," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said John, who, like many Indonesians, only carries one name, TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to “secure” their station because it was attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta the next day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations, but there are processes that need to go through,” he said.
Wiranto then made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything will be regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged with "crimes against humanity" by the United Nations, which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been documented, including the Paniai case.
Families of Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim incredulity.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” says John.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai’s Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots at them.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked, we’re afraid there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how quickly the injured were brought in here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response to this, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained, under the pretext of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who are able to process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between native Papua and new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua seldom have the capital or the skills needed to run their own businesses competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain strained by international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi’s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia’s troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence for human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and oppressed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuas, view their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire on Friday found its way through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that in just two years sweeps through the high-rise, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the fire.
“We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire at 4 a.m. local time (00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding, to decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates for insulation and disguise at London’s Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup Cup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on only two winning bets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but also for this reason highly esteemed five-set classics are thus preserved in the tradition competition.
63.54 percent of member states voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
Even before the vote, after many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had already come.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: This is how the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round in the coming year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travellers bring prohibited items into the plane, poll finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unintentionally smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other items with knives.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late that they had traveled in error with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to miss the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were intentionally smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying objects with blades through the security checks, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought illegal drugs into the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggled goods through airport security and how many had intentionally done so.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through safety were the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids they may take with them or how much of it.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of the items confiscated by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk Doesn't Care: Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far confirmed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed another, less brilliant figure: those of the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had frequently purchased more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Musk now admits that out of a total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are being made, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
That the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem, however, the head of Tesla does not believe.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
In the past year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models are expected to be 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
Those who order a "Model 3" today can expect delivery as early as the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its new, never-tested production roads without major interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can’t stop dissatisfied customers from running away in batches.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws to reduce emissions because of the hindrance to Obama-era rules
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
This is a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s attorney before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was for a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly switched to blocking or delaying regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are opposed to.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanol leaks.
In a statement published Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his return to ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set a deadline for implementation,” Pruitt said, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously.”
However, the EPA’s statement stated that Pruitt will at some point use his “authority to delay and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the rules are “based on sound policy and the best information available.”
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved in the last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our complaints – is an important benefit to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt’s surprising course change.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the air protection officer we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to address environmental polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm for a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the Sixth Beneficial Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made Tumlingen’s friends and sponsors their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique village boy."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the guard" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 silver coins.
According to the text of the document, on Mount Tumling, apart from the former parish church, there was also a royal court, to which the church or patronage law belonged and not vice versa.
People also lived there.
As the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858 shows, in addition to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still recognizable today in the local image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the dominant settlement center of the village.
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
The patronage law originated from the early medieval self-church law.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it, and occupied it with a priest, continued to be the owner of this church and was able to inherit this church of his own.
This was connected with the right to employ a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two breaks down at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be dropped later in World War II in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was wet.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the canopy and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hilarius was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm broke the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower tower still in existence today is preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentners" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
It is designed by the combination of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
In order to align the serenade, a refreshment takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening in the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic views.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim resists" does not see a legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It has been done illegally.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind turbines for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "spreading" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, which had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government due to a form error.
"Because of the lack of planning legal requirement, the issued approval order is still illegal and therefore to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim Resists".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council has again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This precludes the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines at this point."
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen Circle since last week," a spokesperson said.
The circle takes them to the occasion to reconsider the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings before the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the argument of the association "Boisheim resists" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
As early as last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had signed leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind power plants, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households will be covered - which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
The NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the City Council of Viersen gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen and a stake in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured in the incident.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The highway was closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car as part of the accompanying drive with her 53-year-old mother as a companion drove the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and retailers plan "Home Shops" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to lure residents into the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Home-Shopping" weekend is intended to sensitize customers about what offers the city provides away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market, is planned accordingly.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center should invite you to the "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation were commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the trade association and the city are going to a further stage of the project "Attractive Downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest, as well as sales-free Sunday, conversations with all operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Attractive Saturday offers and the waiver of parking fees on that day are also part of the concept.
In addition, potential customers will be re-opened or re-opened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the downtown area when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalize the downtown area - all the way to the landlords, the businesses of the whole city and the associations.
It was true to overcome lethargy, which had spread in part, with a network, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that the third "Heimat-Shops" day will be taking part in five Thuringian cities for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New more people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) another injured was in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building crashed in the explosion.
At first, a missing person was also later saved to death.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of unhappiness, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls over border wall payment
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him for publicly plastering the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the U.S. to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "ridiculous", "measuring" and "stupid" and that the existence of the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after he filed a ban on the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, “This is the most unpleasant call of the entire day.”
Moores Ford Massacre: Activists Reopen Racist Lynch Act as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rushed to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block his way.
The leader of the mob – a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit – took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were hovering in fear.
"We want this n---r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screaming broke the silence when a young black man was shaken by the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a replica.
But then when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience exploded very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“It’s really unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years — even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of replication.
“It’s a dirty spot on a story, but it’s a burden to our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights lawyer.
For him, the remake serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want persecution, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A forensic doctor lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmkeeper Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the town was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But as they then moved away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concluded.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution that not only involved in the murders, removed evidence, and obscured the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more obvious.
“It was a voter-right massacre,” he said.
They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: “If you let yourself register and if you vote, this will happen to you here.”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual replication of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their depiction is visible, gripping, and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to look at, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the lynching because then we will be confronted with its uglyness in all of us,” she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
Samples for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – rushed into a room and listened as Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, who attacks Hester and harasses him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona returns to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still shivering.
"I just don't think white people at the time said 'n--he'."
"Yes," said one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R'."
And that’s where the energy moves in the room, a sense of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's lamenting praise "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple are travelling from Ithaca, New York, to see the show, many just come down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s overwhelming humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys graves.
Until that point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you are standing in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song come out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the body name.
Children croak on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the lynx rope away and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his co-players and then bursts into tears in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispered one of the women.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience gathers with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is chatting about replication with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling behind.
“It’s hard to hear those terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you,” she said.
“What that really does to me makes me think the lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone keeps Brooks Court at his table, eats and remembers civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the show next year.
“Reproduction is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we’ve endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
He who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it.
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets out on a colorful, frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plast and Elasta" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes oldtimer in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an isetta parks.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's guiding motif - money, power and greed - which draws through his "ring" stage.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tearing a body into the trunk in a Hollywood manner, and giving the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the glorious ugly hay surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oak) has to believe in it.
The audience thanked the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski are celebrated stormily, who humblely bows his hands to Merkel’s rute.
There is great support for the festive orchestra, which shows itself for the first time on stage - given the great heat again in alloyed leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was expected with excitement.
Had he still had to have a valid Pfeiffer concert in 2013, there was a big cheer five years later, in which the individual "Buh" calls subsided.
Festival director Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the 'ring' in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding for his viewpoint.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
In their volunteer year, they work in several places.
Anywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I have also worked at the school all day long.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It’s a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-career volunteer.
How's that coming?
Amount: I graduated.
And then a construction engineering degree, let's say, successfully discontinued.
I realized for myself that it’s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, working with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, in the focal point, maybe, really.
And was it so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social science in the winter semester.
I will study dual, I will probably take a social worker training at the Youth Office Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from old age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what bothered me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really went.
Other than in the engineering study?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It’s an area that has a lot to offer.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but so is life.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cut, announced mainly by CEO John Fallon for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, in which already 4,000 jobs were lost.
In May, Pearson announced a <0xC2><0xA3>300 million cost-cutting plan in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid digital learning step.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Suicide Attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month – more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement, NATO said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by persons".
The statement said all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since US-led troops expelled the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay Smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration, which requires states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced its decision to advance the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay the ozone regulations – in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards – by one year by October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to reverse a broad range of environmental impositions imposed on former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump said would boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered a setback by the Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of higher emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhaling air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
The City Council wants a common space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorine-Winzeln decides to establish a community space in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing piece of land has been signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
While it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is owned by the municipality, there is now no longer a planning barrier for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
There is a debate on a common area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a communal space should not be provided as a meeting point only for the residents of the senior housing, but openly entered the municipality.
As an example, the word "strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already in the autumn of last year, will be sweetened by means of funding options.
The construction is in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a Community space would, according to Tjaden, be eligible with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision provides to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a knot between their legs in this regard, the finding that both saddles - which are similar to the surrounding construction - and pulsed roof - which reduces the height of the trench and makes the construction more economical.
Unnecessary, not only Wilfried Sohmer believes, is this addition.
If it helps, he passes the board unanimously.
It is not so easy for the community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which one does not get so far ahead, for that one now leans out of the window at the common room, she says: "I'm having a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the community space - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a grant, but get a real counterpart, marketable in case of doubt, is the opposite.
Staiger's request to split the motion for a decision accordingly finds three supporters.
This is the case with two votes against in the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up as follows: “If we make the decision this way, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure”.
Collision with car: cyclist to be smuggled on the road
On Wednesday, an 82-year-old cyclist in Garath was caught by a car while crossing the road and was seriously injured.
According to police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his way from Hilden on his bicycle on the Schwarzer Weg road at 12.20.
The senior wanted to cross the highway at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
He was given priority by a car driver who was driving in the same direction.
When the Langenfelder was on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He crashed into a car that was driven by a 66-year-old Hilden woman.
The man was smuggled into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game sausage against Dortmund.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personnel concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at the Cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
Also missing are the Munichs Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team responsible.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good lately."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans in their ban.
The match has sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) said on Friday.
Walking from star to star in the resin
In the Harz, the country's first "star path" will be created.
This is planned by the Sternwarte Verein Sankt Andreasberg.
There has been a planetary pathway in Göttingen since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
Members want to create boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations in five to six locations" in Oberharz.
Inquiry came St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
That is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star trail will be extended by train.
"On the path of the stars, the viewers learn a lot of valuable information, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the club said.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star was brighter than another, even though it was much farther away.
It will also tell you in what constellation a selected star is and when it is best seen.
Since 2014, the club has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg the highest-ranking stellar wards in northern Germany.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are often clearly visible with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there is something similar to the planned star dwarf - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard’s hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads up to the Hainberg and to the constellation – as well as an “alien” location in Diemarden (community equals) with the planet Sedna.
The poles with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the endpoint degraded to the dwarf planet - are exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun stands exactly 75 meters away at least 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match under <0xC2><0xA3>147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia’s victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you all the best."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I'm a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I rose for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxers need this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Fornake Libe in September.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later speaking out to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready...”
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as “a huge fighter,” and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-match champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus was on showing punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that has to be fought.
No other fight brings so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre rampage
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partially seriously injured.
According to first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira at 4.30 p.m. just before the market wide outlet probably lost control of his vehicle after a tyre pitcher.
The car swerved right into the mess, where it overlapped and then stayed on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane could be passed at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2–2 start of the season against Braunschweig, the optimisation of the defence formation will bring points to Aue.
With the first game of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result too, if there had not been the two opposing goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
“That was two opponents too much and we have to be even more careful in Aue,” says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the three-chain will be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes don't want to catch themselves anymore.
“For the future, it will be such that no one else will stand on the line next to Michael [Rensing].”
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation with the three-chain, his team is better than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players in the three-tier chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we don't make so many playback mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But whether one can speak of a failed start after an indecision, I don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are at the moment,” says the Fortuna defender.
The guests from the Rhineland will go to the final (almost) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday as a light favourite.
"That we wipe them away just because we have the right to come under the top six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is quite positive in a defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the front,” explains Fortunas head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and exaggerating".
And that's not the way Funkel wants to see his players on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests Released
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the people tested are over 18 years of age. But not everyone believes the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are to make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) has been criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, the Migration Agency has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "possibly is under 18 years of age".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying that there are 442 cases that "propose that the person investigated is 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t do as if we could,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is barely under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent."
Fully in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well underway.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton piece of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
“We’re very good at the time, it’s going great,” says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Government Presidium Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the town entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge fastener, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run on it.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach requires a special sense of fingertips.
Because there is also a fiberglass cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by handzettel.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700 000 euros.
Everything is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull on a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that peacefully shows the flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster "great election campaign offensive".
And well-known names are taking off – such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and Vice President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A beautiful picture that presents itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of Forums Ein Welt and one of the key organizers, is really happy about: "It's great how many people have come together here".
There’s music and plenty of food, including a “German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, she shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanoes reported that he had made an effort for such an event and received the grant.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially requested in Daun, but got a rejection there because due to the already built Laurentius kirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondellplatz, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
At around 8 p.m., there is a band for entertainment in the town hall, with various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes just over an hour, guests at the venue have a longer breath, but it is also there to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can pull back - no special incidents.
Posaune meets Trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher posaunist Frederic Belli will take place in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German formation with roots in blast music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as if in a new suit, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play are mixed into a fascinating piece.
This core piece of the program was only released this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
“When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what comes next?’”
The Hollywood star’s best-known relationship was with her “Twilight” colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress reassures the Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I've dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?”
After their separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: “I have always lived and believed in dualism.
It has never confuse or impede me.
I just never wanted to be taken seriously.”
According to "Bang Showbiz", she had suffered particularly, but in school, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was 11, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared, and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of you!'"
She doesn’t like to explain her love life to the public: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a press conference with President Trump that he will be switching the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor."
The announcement broke out in cheer.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying, "The party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislatures in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, end-to-end message to a news outlet," RNC spokesperson Ronna said in a statement.
Coe praises Russia's 'honest' apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal on Thursday, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's banning from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted "all the athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals at competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything in its power to ensure that the Federation is reshaped.”
Coe said he was also "satisfied" that Russia would accept the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-engage Russia," Coe said.
“We will have to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which will start in London on Friday, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for a reset.
Drug tests were still insufficient and banned trainers were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Complaints about soldiers killed in Mali
At a mourning celebration in Fritzlar, North Hesse, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) did not say anything about the cause of the abstention.
But she called the two dead pilots "Knower of her trade".
“We bow down to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday.
Her Sarges were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a bodyguard of the Federal Army brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
At lunchtime, only the family said goodbye to the church.
After that, the mourning celebration began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Federal Army as well as politics.
Among them were Hesse’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Sad guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the sergeants.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the slain soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The chief of staff had built up the flight operation of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to".
Minister von der Leyen did not show doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the deployment is dangerous.
But it is also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two states," she said.
After the funeral, the martyrs were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be deposited, the Federal Army did not provide any information.
Prince Henry doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is joined in the cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement continued.
Where Prince Henry will be buried is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be annexed to his French homeland.
Prince Henry had never made a fool of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's accession to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.
In 2016, he retired and won the title of "Prinzessmahl".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after his death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the 83-year-old’s final resting place will be is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be deployed in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for over the past 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always fled the sympathies of the people, Prince Henry had a difficult position with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign.
In an autobiography about the first years in Denmark, Henrik said: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk socks instead of knit socks, citroen instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for reassurance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed of myself.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants quick re-election
CDU and FDP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony’s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick re-election of the country’s parliament after the loss of the red-green majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday he spoke in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising resignation of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the national election, the Red-Green Coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Greens-Deputy Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said in Hannover on Friday.
CDU Group Leader Björn Thümler would like to recommend to his group that they be included.
Together, the CDU and the FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, the SPD and the Greens would have 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new country day will be elected regularly on January 14 next year.
Thumler said the red-green state government now has to decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is imperative that the Landtag decides on its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further approach on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the country's day of the prime minister will distrust and elect a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be tested legally cleanly,” Thumler said.
"All questions will be discussed in peace, if they are legally reasonable."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but somewhat curious".
The politician herself emphasized: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a follower of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the deputies to give back their mandate.
“We are of course assuming that she will return her mandate of the country’s parliament, which she has received via the green list of countries, with immediate effect,” said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korner, the country’s presidents.
Green Group President Anja Piel said: “We regret the decision of Elke Twest exceptionally.”
You have consciously decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no content differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxon Green Deputies Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of the Red-Greens," the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the country's parliament re-elected quickly.
The exit of the West costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her hurt foolishness and in her frustration puts her personal interests before the good of the country," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and trying to smash political capital out of it".
Lower Saxony’s CDU Group Leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his MP to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, the leader of the SPD faction in the Bundestag, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 national election with personal career recollection.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority by one vote in the country's parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and responds in an interview with the RND (Redaktionsnetz Deutschland).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamping print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg charges.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all that we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response – all the eggs out of the offer – because the central role of the Enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of Germany’s concern.
All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and health-free.
If, in the case of eggs, the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded, they are not marketable.
Unloaded eggs, however, can be sold and eaten.
This time, it is not the business’s fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controls.
Is it just the staff, or is it the final responsibility?
After all, it was the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent clarification of such events and the handover to the public prosecutor's offices in cases where criminal offences may be present are crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and marketable foodstuffs.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By means of the armored means, manufacturers, traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the posture of food-providing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the matter will be clarified quickly and without gaps.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organisation that oversaw the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, introduced by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so Neymar can sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding by Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to acquire players, but have to tax them with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the focus on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And although Platini has fallen into disrepute from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to strive to deter excessive spending.
"Definitely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," UEFA's FFP manager Andrea Traverso told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can allocate the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption amount for the next five years can be set at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 was met by PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
PSG received a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (then $82 million), which was later lowered to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and it was ordered to keep the team members limited to 21 players for the 2014/15 Champions League season instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to override their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a cathartic company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar through payments from the organisational committee of the 2022 World Cup could come to Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar have argued in 2022 that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more aware of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar’s transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and t-shirt sales.
The association expects revenue to increase by at least 30 percent after signing the agreement.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go, and she tried to prevent Neymar’s withdrawal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," said La Liga president Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s reservations against a state that finances an association.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fairplay because you can go different paths or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new supplier today.
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is nearing a possible end: the airline re-writes the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products will be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-white packed slides of 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "North-West Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But more important is always the advertising effect: for a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss do not want to betray.
Only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss entered into a contract with Migros’ daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline is cooperating with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with delicacies from the Sprüngli Confectionery, in the Business Class for passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Chocolate Frey on short distances, both in the business and in the economy class.
Athletics - Discuss Olympian Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup final and could only watch the discus competition from the stand.
Also with the first attempt, Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (as the forebears David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, going to the size of Paul and herself - that is, going to Ruy's Bank before 2001, Star.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken of by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag – middle-aged actors playing horny children who grow up – they managed to get the last part of the joke back.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting can principle, including a ref to the 1990s Stalker films such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character strolls through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the main stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there’s another crazy-vicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a very successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd showcasing Matt Dillon’s underlip of “Singles”, whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random insanity that could warm this franchise up like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last sceneWet will show the band's "Hopre, she'll show the American movie."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West ring fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Joseph – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find Out the Voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it pulls there, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a smaller length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, as Gregor and Joseph visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who swallow a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make everything a food for a gelage.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and theirs.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Konstanz Public Prosecutor’s Office announced on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and have already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the prosecutor’s office in Konstanz has been investigating the organized drug trade in the southern German region.
There was a good exchange between the prosecutor’s offices in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nationals with a close connection to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to go to the account of the gang.
Wisely complains of large gaps in the Foreigner Registry
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant deficiencies.
This leads to some serious misconceptions about asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there in asylum procedures and deportations could lead to "partially serious misconceptions", the South German newspaper warned in an analysis.
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register, including approximately 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been adequately maintained, the data quality in some parts has not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "by people who are long no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register".
"Erroneous data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report said.
In addition, the statistics on persons who are obliged to leave are EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such misallocations, however, “lead to a distorted debate about dealing with travellers,” according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This is evidenced by an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has been conducting such procedures "in respect of families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since June 1, 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the spot.
Under the Dublin Agreement, the EU is responsible for the refugees that they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
For the reasons, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, a spokeswoman for the left-wing group in the Bundestag, criticised the decision: “Families with children are threatened by human rights violations of the Italian asylum system and a threat to the well-being of children.”
The second best result is achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already made available by the blood donation service to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded the award on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations now.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the council, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our body is designed for this and we should respect the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even useless for that," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, the head of the German Red Cross (DRC), because the cans are broken down into their constituents.
In this way, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that are being carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
“This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors,” said the DRK circuit manager.
Obviously, the move to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Already before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many were booked by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave up their life juice ten times.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family income amid mounting pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that interest rate increases would be needed in the coming years to curb inflation fuelled by Brexit, and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth conjunctural package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system – with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expected.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be made "stagely" and "limited".
The Bank’s downwardly corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7%, compared to the forecasts in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision will not change after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest rate increase and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the escalation will worsen at first, before it will then improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” income break-in in the coming years, but she added that wages will recover “significantly” by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the drop in the pound.
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s latest ruling on interest rates, the reputation for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation declined last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess in relation to its 2% target was "completely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are keenly looking for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those with expiry of existing deals and new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September following a battle before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He said he was willing to fund the process after the appeals court confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claiming that local authorities should finance him.
The chess move announced on Thursday was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medications in a person’s body to prevent an HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants who agree to the study are identified, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This great new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuous progress in tackling one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We very much welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who is at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been acquired, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
“Now it’s important that this study be conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Big Life: Mid-floor and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
“Before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely renovated.
Originally a one-room property with a disconnected layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to buckle.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but laying the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height over each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne’s cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," Erfan explains from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so it slides very easily when you slid the door."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you will sell the land – or how your property is valued,” Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here, they have managed to enlarge the floor surface while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave her.
Brothers Struggle for $500 Million Real Estate Imperium
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, raised since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes downtown offices, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.
Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one-third.
A court order states that this means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"Colin's proposed divisions have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property kindly to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, “were bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin has been very restrained even though he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by text to say "I really can't say much" because the case was in court.
“It’s very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and pull our family names through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
“Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that fell into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“When candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were to be convinced,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady price of praise."
[Sighs] Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don’t know others – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump hasn’t sent.
If his employees managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico, who is very busy with this story, reported in May about the consultants' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he’s deepening to find out where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a pile of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to scams, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he had made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter “have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives.”
How'd that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is sought and hoped.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted perpetrators are not known by nature, information from the population is expected and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action, which follows on the "EU Most Wanted" calendar of the winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Thirty-six of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them due to references to the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a trench and return to the ‘Millionaires Series’
Some of the West Midlands’ wealthiest homeowners are once again standing on foot with some determined travelers who have negotiated a grave pulled by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street in Solihull called the “Millionaires Series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters with them after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a grave excavated by the Council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have oppressed Solihull's council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being forwarded by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can’t even stop it.”
A resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park.”
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull’s police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we are presenting our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year and also revenues from the tourist tax were lost.
In the autumn of 2014, given the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council office as a gathering accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the city council at the time.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel’s location and was already talking about serious stakeholders at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back into a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadter Objekt.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work will be done.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially demolished, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to do until March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything will be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high level of downtown, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be spacious, Scherer explains further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already been conducted, according to Scherer.
The views of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Less than a million dollars, he said.
The exterior installations are also brought on front man, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: “The city of joy is a good market.”
Russia Affair: U.S. Special Investigator Appoints Grand Jury
In the Russia affair about U.S. President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have employed a so-called Grand Jury, according to a report.
The panel has taken up work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, referring to people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper rated the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that there are already first inquiries of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations will be several men who acted in the election campaign as advisers to the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also increasingly took Trump’s private and business environment under control.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Investigator Trump personally went to the center and investigated the charge as to whether the president may have impeded justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand jurys are also called prosecution chambers.
They are usually switched on when these are larger and controversial cases.
The process is always carried out behind closed doors.
The board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to invite individuals to be interviewed under oath.
According to CNN, invitations have already been issued for the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present.
Law experts said on U.S. television on Thursday evening that the establishment shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide whether to file an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“The history of Russia is a total invention,” Trump said.
The theme gives Democrats an opportunity to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these also usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House advocated any measures that "fairly" accelerated the work of the Special Investigator.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it will not be investigated against the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed about it, the statement continued.
Mueller, however, was only employed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this draft, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to impede justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wants to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Investigator such as in the Watergate affair about the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the President by the Justice Department.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills that would no longer allow the Special Investigator to be fired so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the shellfish.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than a trillion tons and 5,800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two, three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants recorded by researchers in the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
To what extent climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg, research indicates that it is unclear.
Overall, however, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, the US Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
In the opinion of many researchers, this may be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was thus far part of the Larsen-C shellfish.
Shellfish floats on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C shellfish is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shellfish, the equilibrium of growth and breakdown was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shellfish has collapsed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C shellfish is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under stress and can break down if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of shellfish and icebergs does not increase the sea level, as they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it results from the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shellfish means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could potentially increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Project (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen C shellfish is the fourth largest shellfish in Antarctica, with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down there regularly.
“Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more dangerous position,” said Martin O’Leary of the University of Swansea.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the recordings began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, there was controversy as to whether the Larsen C shellfish will now grow again or decline over the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding, "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will last for decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the decomposition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed.
This long zip of Antarctica stretches in the direction of South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants house tariffs on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag has won 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teachers in the circle are obviously very much wanted.
Around 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to be able to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied positions at Mettmann County.
Among other things, doctors and engineers are sought as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and counter the shortage of specialists in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for recruitment and staff development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but to counter the future-oriented shortage of applicants, it says.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-border entrants and include a training offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG demand.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn’t know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees, and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a 'competition of public employers'.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who withdraw from the service due to illness or age.
So, it’s time to act so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
However, Klaus-Dieter Völker, the leader of the CDU faction, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He made a big surprise during the last round when he publicly questioned the cost of personnel coverage and surprised the other parties.
Peoples want to examine all the possibilities that make it possible to leave the municipal employers’ association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district towns - should seek a house tariff," Volker said.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exist if you switch to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Last but not least, due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone for NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs deploying lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation Jugend Rettung because its crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement to social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rescue', which has been Iuventa since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take migrants on board, who will be delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far declared themselves ready to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring with them "significant changes or hindrances" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libya’s coast guard and cooperation with local mayors had been fruitful.
"In the last few days we have started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Ascents and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Pole to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by views, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pale forest and the pre-layered plains.
In the meantime, there were longer increases, rewarded for the long trials.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, viewpoint reached viewpoint, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate ascents.
In the last two days, a lot of altitude meters have been dialed again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe in healing soles in the free air inhaler.
New York City was also under control.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had gotten to know the Palatinate forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating in wind and weather over the stadium races?
The fact is, eSports has long been a serious industry, a lucrative business – including big stars, millions of fans and huge high-gain tournaments.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga associations, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and finally VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports division in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there will be several more clubs on this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association will host the first “Interactive Club World Cup” in London, where gamers from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14- to 30-year-olds in particular that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," the 52-year-old said.
And: The associations tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports under contract, you could be online much more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or FIFA football simulation are challenged on a competitive level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly habitual.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Frobose also sees problems: “Doping is becoming more and more a topic.”
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are travelling internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the German Federation of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, this led to a turnover of 50 million euros in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, that is not much.
However, the e-sports are “not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already international.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball player Shaquille O’Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a teaching discipline, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the football league associations are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind", explains VfB-Vorstand Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia and to explain the old days is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt says.
“You can’t just say that in football everything stays the way it always was.”
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The poison-laden eggs scandal has affected almost all of the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all the eggs from the sale in Germany.
Only eggs that are not shown to contain fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Suicide by Conrad Roy
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were put to trial.
Carter was convicted of negligent murder in June of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.
She had been facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands, and eyes downwards when she was condemned.
“Their actions have killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She didn’t take responsibility,” she said.
"She showed no regrets."
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother Lynn Roy, saying that “there is no day when I don’t regret the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us forever.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be "persecuted" by the finding that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“To no longer have this one person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain that I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump out of a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from some press coverage of the case.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete in the Audi Cup as captain is no coincidence.
FC Bayern is counting on the Confed Cup winner for a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something else was there in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the tie assigned to him stop at his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner said after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the stop could have been better than the 0:2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also be interpreted as such.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as the game leader in the C-Elf, which consisted of youth players, debutants and just professionals who came from the holiday.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot, who you want to keep in tune.
So, those who were selected to join the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed, "This is what you want as a player: taking responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flickered across the field as a mini-lamb.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on her arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich seemed in this starter formation like the one who can take the rudder in the best hand.
He gave instructions, trying to steer the unplayed troop.
He had the eyes for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (it hardly worked); Renato Sanches to connect to the performances of the Asia trip (it only worked conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not appear negative in their first appearance in the Bayern Trikot.
After all, it worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereign.
The famously occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to be successful in the construction of the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we had hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game relocation, pace change: "For this style I was also picked up".
How unusual this Bavarian world is still for the new arrivals, we saw later on the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crunchy statements behind his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game."
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionary is almost club club club of <0xC3><0x96>FB captain Schnaderbeck and fevers with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
The famous Bavarian-Dusel may well be needed by our ladies.
Business Satisfies with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy Praises Knowledge Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often inconsistent when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V's request of a change in economic policy - while taunting the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: “Wissing takes on the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked.”
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: the gap closure of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s list of priorities.
Still this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021, the construction law will stand.
Trier, which is in urgent need of the federal road plan, also plays a role in the country’s plans.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a roadmap to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
As prompted by Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) of Trier is aiming to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Crafts Chamber Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1000 for the master’s examination and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2500 if graduates make themselves independent within ten years of the master’s training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is quick to create facts, while the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive officer of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to employ Wissing in the country’s operations, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU faction vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also encouraging to see the broadband expansion in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies rated the network supply in an IHK survey with only a rating of 3.4.
They complained about stalling internet connections and disruptions.
Former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke, however, is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of supervisors of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she was already clearing the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
A day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the business as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing systems to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of embezzling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices, which emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but falling back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a demand that focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profits.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join, tomorrow a fleet will sail through Munich, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large river between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not an ordinary fleet, with Isar tourists.
But the Baureferat wants to clear up.
On the river you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a rubbish mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ...", it is intended to sharpen the understanding for the Isar as a protective wildflower.
Last summer, the fleet drove over the Isar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's Nose and the Smile Against the Suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon cartoonists, the nostrils of his characters are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentine still draws and is working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he worked as a congratulatory card drawer - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost in my job,” he said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Over and over again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures tuck into drawings featuring the sliding Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, T-shirts, plush and watches, his quirky figures continue to spread around the world.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The protagonist in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footer as a counterpart.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is set to hit the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he is more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and insect-borne diseases, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “Lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicadas, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only appealing to holidaymakers, it is also in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions to be considered include better water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön today celebrates its 1200-year existence.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Cramers, octopus, merchants, vagants or a country slave camp are supposed to be in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa state through organized crime, corrupt officials, and unstoppable drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is required, perceptions and abdominal sensations are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartel, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far there have been at least seven in this year.
Among the latter are her editor and her inspiration for Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties typah, Aaron Ibarra or their visions with the zechelins of Zechelins, Miriam T. Ramirez,
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murders of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa’s violence, even though they are inconsolable and even more treacherous.
“Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to discuss security,” Ibarra said.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we all mistrust.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates to "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and revenue and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever he led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take on the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could fly like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
He trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how she can do her job best and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Confidence in your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "it smells like a sense that can be misled... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees met for security training, no phones were suddenly allowed, days before it was announced that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 <0xC2><0xB0> C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountainous landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state spending, which focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group carrying out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels for the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Only a few months earlier, readers had considered Valdez’s column the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what happened earlier," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been converted into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist at the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since requested that she be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “enveloped” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a headline article on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the public staircase in front of the office and drank beer when all of a sudden all of their phones started ringing.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartels embassies in the region.
From the edge of the stone, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens hung up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who were guarding to see if they were ready.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees followed in his footsteps.
"How can you think of closing it down," Bojorquez said, "if the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reportage."
Dinosaurs used tarnish to escape their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa the Dinosaur.”
It was so well received that they could even notice that his scaly skin was of reddish brown – and they said she had had something of an “uneasy past.”
The report in the journal Current Biology called him "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved state has surprised researchers who describe it as "really remarkable".
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he excavated the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) heavy clumps of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible.
"It will enter science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white tarnish to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershade, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours exploring it carefully.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shells and armor on his body.
They discovered the contra shade, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature’s tip was darker than its underside.
Although counter-schatting is common, the results are surprising, since the size of borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs of sufficient pressure, that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use contra shade — think of deer, zebras, or belt animals — are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous era must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur’s skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank to the sea floor on his back.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it; if you just shovel a little with your eyes, you might almost think he's asleep."
The Cretaceous era was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that borealopelta was submerged in the ocean after its death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he excavated on March 21, 2011, at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that radiated from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was floated through western Canada until a flooded river floated it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skins still cover hollow plates of armor along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the hollow armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
In the storm: mass carburetor on A8: Many injured
Severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carabiner.
There are numerous injured, mile-long congestion - and forklifts.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) some 20 people were injured in a mass car rampage late on Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, at about 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) connecting points, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interconnected during a storm.
There was no information on the exact number of injured at first.
These are light to medium-sized injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large order of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of driving Munich, a about ten kilometers long backbone was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there have also been massive obstacles on the interstate - through numerous forklifts.
The fire brigade noted the signs of the vehicle handlers, which now have to face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: You don’t know how to sit on the train and sleep.
Or you’re immersed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
Comes the driver and wakes an unsuspecting person or rips the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket checks.
But the times of interruption are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creatorless ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
“When the offer comes, we expand it.
It will then be expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year,” said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without a driver.
To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.
You must also have purchased it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, call his ticket under "My tickets".
The test customer then appears a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at Place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can go to sleep, keep working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used by the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train escorts, just check in with the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal,” said Michael Peterson, Marketing Director at DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs".
Those who often ride the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest problems.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card is missing or a document that must be presented.
The consequences are endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which lead to bad mood in the department or large room and delays in checking your own ticket and the creator eventually takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
“Police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She put down her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father who wore a sign saying, “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer insured his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
“That’s not the kind of murder we’re used to and we can call it typical.”
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition.”
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t right.
I couldn’t take her,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well-developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to be free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky to give her an experience where she doesn’t personally experience ecstatic racism, she’s no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take on Ferrell’s form.
“My activism has changed completely after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?”
This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often by whites – in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview, “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn’t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already collaborated with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. We are talking," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’ll be portrayed.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really being maintained by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who blew up that energy,” she said.
“It’s no coincidence that she was on the front line because there’s so much at stake in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell has been on trial for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Still, she clings to a song and feels committed to that memory since she took to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Size Wax": TV Readers Discuss Bit Gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall on the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject is hardly cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While one says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), the other comes: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Bettzen) or simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents build on a gallery pulling more customers into the city, which also benefits the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the Farmers Market Hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the Bauernmarkthalle for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady again and again very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, it comes to the level of rent.
But it is not likely to be low on the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.
There are enough of these in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not bearable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more specialty shops and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't suit me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where will the farm market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery is coming sometime.
Or does the ghost-bit-gallery manage to dispose of all the shops from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, there is no place for a lot of - as I find it - useless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farm market hall is demolished, a piece of culture will disappear again."
An Appropriate Similarity: Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost inconspicuously alike - hanging from the ceiling by cables.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tupfs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst forbade a 35-year prison sentence after making secret diplomatic messages public via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Similarity.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, has a sharp, though somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data, but also on how they can be interpreted and interpreted.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since she was a teenager, was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts, including six counts of violating the law of espionage, computer fraud, and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo — a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver’s seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig — with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project ‘Stranger Vision’.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and rubber by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t be visited at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, "Suppressed Images", which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release just a few days after the book was published after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy gathering.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, dubious ways to further fuel the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning demanded with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the artist’s highly developed scientific dictionary) how astonishingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
“What people are hoping to take with them is that our genome doesn’t care who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also seen.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic-novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a free-phone in her hand from the United States disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
“If they cold your speech, they’ve won,” it says.
"So never keep your mouth shut."
“It came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition in person yet – as predicted in the comic book – but if she should, she’ll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulations, collapsing like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>, Manning’s stature), at which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was strangled in a luxurious Chicago apartment with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the Cook County District Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on vacation and excluded from entering Northwestern University’s campus.
“This is now a criminal law matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to come forward.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: “The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.
On the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that doesn’t exist.”
The words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission, agreed.
In conversation with the Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 as part of the WADA doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is “going in the right direction” to be deployed again.
Aldi doesn't sell eggs anymore
This was reported by the corporate groups.
It is a purely precautionary measure, it can no longer be expected of any health impairment, it said in the statement.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to be tested negative for fipronil-like anti-solvents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The Start-Ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee’s luck at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or – worse – fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There simply never was consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, to direct the whistleblowers to advise them to respond directly to the whistleblowers.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Rescue said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results – so you can mimic why.
Companies come to realize that you need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber to be involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have been talked about have been exposed.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailored “pulse” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of their problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has seized the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee fluctuations, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company employs Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until “social media came to their senses” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, charging companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both supported startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong and that the work you do is worth doing, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well. Companies are running well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
Data about employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change is not coming fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you’re asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow, employees will ask themselves, ‘Have you really heard me?
Do you care about it?
And if you don’t care about it, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem is reported over Glint, Rescue said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always gaining new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bonding of employees in an industry known for high revenues.
“If you’re not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
“If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you will lose business.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practice and makes a long day for the Bruins
It comes at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are playing on one side of the team’s new practice grounds on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show a sweaty back from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys over the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden on players, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players’ already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons of practice in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises in the course of August 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their debut against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule change, even if it adds another point to the busy routes of the players.
“We’re putting this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which is not easy given the clear lines of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, a high-class hotel already pitched with footballs that will be a protective net behind a doorpost.
Bruins players are set to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it’s not far off to think that people are renting a room there and then setting up there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday, one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible misrepresentations and send them to fact-checkers who may display fact-check results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May, and Germany is backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail quickly, as if they were going to be doing hateful postings in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to knowing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they’re reading and sharing,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and is working on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Romance: A Castle in the History of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy Bewl River Valley seat in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mobster Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says weaningly.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Ages of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’ in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a doping agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was himself in it.
I love the archives!”
For someone so beaten up with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have my welcome a little overrated"), all this seems to be nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, scouring the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the excavation.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes even with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch that the two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go its course!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they’re connected to each other?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler' depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty gaunners, making debts again and again and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women – I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise heirlooms.”
After the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about life, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (round view of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz will keep the logo and slogan a secret.
At the end of August, as a highlight of the campaign, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or?" the makers of the action asked since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
“We don’t really think that (of course!),” she wrote on her website released yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable singularity".
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average of five digits its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirements and transports in the officer corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, it is a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as before, but in the Prime Minister’s office.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the triggers in the military.
General Staff Chief Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army – mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the goalkeeper of the coup attempt.
486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt a “gift of God” because it gave him the opportunity to “completely cleanse” the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uncomfortable in the military headquarters".
In the general staff, there are concerns about the increasing "Islamization" of the army, which among other things manifests in the lifting of the headband ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the great cleansing of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, by decree, Erdogan fired another 7,395 civil servants, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It was as if Erdogan had taken over the military.
The generals were considered to be the real lords of the country.
Three times, they put up their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least with reference to the reform proposals of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is aiming to advance the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is the case, such a development could not keep NATO cold.
However, after the purges, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army for use in the alliance.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities have been “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington is changing the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, citing the media.
It plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in both chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. is issuing Green Cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Ministry wants to sanitize track for race lifts
Over and over again in the past few months, the future of the racing shuttle has been disputed - now it should go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the maroden route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the race lift in the long term, construction work on the track is scheduled to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this connection important especially for tourism," Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl said in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to around 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a duration of eleven years.
With this, the Rennsteig shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train connection between the train stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, in the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The track is also highly buildable in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it couldn’t get even more crazy in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, I do.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chestnut and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we’re going to get them to see them even more often,” Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more worrying, as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which convey the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that’s as well suited to your personality as possible,” the True Companion website says.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixed on conversation, or she may be “in the mood”!
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subordinate feminine traits, the hints of rape, when you take a step on frigid (here it's called: repulsive) Farrah.
On his website, True Companion compares Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just holding another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still temporarily stay on the edge of consumer culture.
But what permeates the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap, however, that these highly developed sex robots emerge at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about having sexually assaulted women.
The most terrifying aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maid') is not the graphic images, the bodies that are swallowed and the eyes that are stretched out, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can’t separate yourself from your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence, or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: Maid
Trump's big performance?
It makes Mitt Romney a part of the common sense.
It has become a blunt wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small amounts.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s voting relatives.
We’re all supposedly trying to get our filter bubbles cracked.
Less noticeable is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had been fighting for politics for decades, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in another context that this also carries considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the devastating effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the horrific possibility that his girlfriends will not be repulsed by us one day.
However, there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be an implication of reasonableness compared to his standards.
I find myself today plagued by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s primitive version of the madman – the dog on the roof of the car that had a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which in comparison to Trump actually occur to one as a very mild crime.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate needs only to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder – all clowns are clumsy and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders – extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage – the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a big circular traffic in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars this week in a department store before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% drinking fee - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the department store was grinning, apologetically, while I was tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left the prison for a second visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered from a case in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to impose this time against Pistorius Appell’s six-year prison sentence, which they say is too prudent.
The National Prosecution Authority said it would raise an objection to the South African Supreme Court, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fötzen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into the secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to high school in the future, four to the real school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Town Hall in Epfenhofen on Tuesday night.
As a symbol for the school release, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken yard, but is then released into freedom.
To this end, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it sprout out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken was shattered, and the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and fled.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's internship.
The hens danced with the young goggles who wore cylinders to make the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (kuken), it belongs to them.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
Thanks were given to the colleagues, the former head of the school Michael Müller, who always jumps in at school shortages, and the parents representatives.
The cuddling time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She dismisses her students after two years of teaching only very reluctantly, because it has been a really great time.
In the end, they were able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all students heard a song of summer and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first-class students have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camps in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by television, said.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people illegally detained in Sithonia were arrested by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Affected People Need to Know Now
How exactly is the software update taking place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are designed to improve the exhaust performance of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempted from this.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives reviews:
Is the new action binding?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have foaming software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofit has been ordered by the Federal Motorsport Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet specified an exact date.
Daimler has announced to write to each affected person.
In any case, if an inspection is due, it will be done within their framework.
How long should the total refurbishment take?
"It's hard to say," Smetanin said.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers have not volunteered to act on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
Refurbishment itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would be attracted, according to Smetanin.
Is there a massive decline in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But especially in regions where driving bans threaten.
There has been no loss of value for older diesels in rural areas so far.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also included singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known for progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He told The New York Times: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that's a burden on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.
The job has already been awarded - however, suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a Stadtbaumeister.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he communicates in the press interview.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or a construction engineer at the nearest possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular notice deadlines, there should still be enough time for a recruitment.
Since Haslach acts as a Lower Construction Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present the relevant conclusions.
This function is intended to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But closeness to citizens is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good operating climate as well as good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
“We make the city worth living,” he says, with confidence about the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future, various projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot have been initiated, for example.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will hit with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun.”
Design is available for an urban master with a large area of play.
With Haslach’s own construction and gardening, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
“One can move a lot,” says Wacker, and the design of the greenery is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monumental protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the separating urban master emphasizes.
In any case, the urban master has a high responsibility.
He's the builder, "in the end, everything runs over my table."
In terms of care and coordination, he can count on long-time employees: Markus Neumaier (High Construction) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Deep Construction) has been with him for 15 years.
Also, that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the place and wants to stay".
Continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to emerge Roland Wacker, you should be able to complete your studies as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction law and planning.
The City Building Office is responsible for high- and low-rise construction, construction planning, ground-handling, management of urban properties, urban farm with construction yard and urban gardening, as well as the Lower Building Law Authority including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on cables: South railway line blocked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators have been searching for two male perpetrators since the night.
Near the scene, witnesses had seen a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a loudspeaker strike," <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of the rail replacement traffic, the rail customers could also reach the perpetrators.
Overall, it is expected to be a “significant” sum, the spokesperson said.
The damage was repaired again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be run without hindrance.
Nearly ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which were concerned with long-distance traffic.
Goods trains did not fail, but they had a delay.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, overhead lines had to be replaced about 200 meters.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While affected people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the equilibrium tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance is present in mice that carry a specific bacteria in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have made a connection between a bacterial species – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel mucus if the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice—the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid – without the bacteria – to immature immune cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether L. reuteri by-products develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signature began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' pre-Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him be ready sooner rather than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his top four new commitments.
"Three out of four to get, I thank the club for that," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve put a lot of effort into it.”
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
In the past, Boeing had made such advertising.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New deep blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no conflagration from the party headquarters, just no counter-wind from the federation - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with increasing anxiety.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counter-wind.
There were deep blows.
And one after the other.
The Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the RND.
The surprising faction exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary election, his red-green coalition lost its unanimity majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Greens’ chief executive Michael Kellner has called on the abdicated Lower Saxony’s Greens’ deputy Elke Twesten to resign.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must return its mandate immediately," the Federal Executive Director and campaign leader of the Greens told the German Redaktionsnetz (RND).
"This must not be all true," whispered an SPD campaigner, when the new Job message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister-President of Lower Saxony, is present after the transition of the Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the provisional climax of a series of major and minor crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The miseries began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades of his time calmed down.
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
And so it was – and it all got worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the brink, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smoothly.
Effortlessly, the comrades rejoined in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next deep blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbe Philharmonic while his city burned down.
And because in the crisis communication afterwards, he did pretty much everything you can do wrong.
Scholz has been fighting for his political survival ever since.
And now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW Abgas affair and his role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Miese survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely for that reason, Weil has been trying increasingly to put accents in the Bund in recent weeks.
The former mayor of Hannover’s attempt to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden even among colleagues around Martin Schulz.
They let him admit it because they promised themselves a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
In this case, because of the party-internal dispute of the Lower Saxon Greens, there is basically no blame.
And Schulz isn't.
At times, the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all, at the relentless Parliamentarian Twest.
"It is unbearable and damaging to democracy, as Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party inks in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion, the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the list of the Lower Saxon Greens.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, lamented an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag elections, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local centres III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house that has come into the years can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been refurbishment areas in receptions.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the total funding.
In Renovation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still at 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to promote internal development, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4, the Government Presidium in Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation zone III.
The amount of funding is 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros came from the country, the rest received from the municipality.
How is a refurbishment area created?
You will, Schindler continues, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in rehabilitating in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal State program "Social City", in the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of urban areas, the improvement of living and working conditions, and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot, carried out.
Finally, the area of restoration would be defined as a statute.
The grant period for the grants runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the stocktaking would only be carried out once, within the framework of which those involved in the area of rehabilitation will receive a questionnaire to be filled in.
In November or December, as much as possible, the decision will be taken so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is about evaluating the urban deficiencies and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A refurbishment note will then be entered in the land register for the respective plot.
Pietzschmann himself will come again after receiving and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch", which deals with, among other things, the construction condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet", information can be made about the size, division and inhabitants of a dwelling.
The blue "operation sheet" can only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of the means of transport works according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, feeds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the attendees a "tasteful" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed by medical standard.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is in control.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military’s data left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the Hu.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy commander of the Navy for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at 7 a.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours, a second crew would be needed for the return flight.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
From the records provided to TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the Presidential jet provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about his predecessor's use of the Presidential jet.
“The White House is thrilled by the show ‘Made in America’ — showing products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials,” said the White House’s deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to drop the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeter rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers did not take over the burden for any of the other requisites presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for Presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense’s hourly rate for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Recordings of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
“Determining the costs for taxpayers based on the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but rather take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before a difficult task
The top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga joins the table draw Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will arrive tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the Tabellenritter Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite a still impeccable balance after five games, the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team manager Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
In the back positions, I think the team is very good.”
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV, the imports from the high north are mainly ensured.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the doubles", says Zay looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“As always, it becomes difficult for us.
You also need a good amount of luck.”
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue-White could be Maxime Janvier.
Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is currently not in the Bundesliga match at the Challenger Tournament in Biella in Italy, comes to his first use this season at the tournament in Liberec.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was at the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at Alster, M<0xC3><0xA1>té Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America Can Hurt the OMV
Fortunately, Donald Trump did not act when he signed his signature on Wednesday night under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
“In his haste to pass the law,” Congress had encased a few “unconstitutional regulations,” he said.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shuddered against the U.S. strike.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors of the local OMV, which, together with other European companies, co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Line Nord Stream 2, have been concerned.
The Drohkulisse is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has 12 weapons to choose from.
"The press" looked at what the group could defend and what could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be centered in the Netflix hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar’s killer, the series of Netflix is not far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful patents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is their head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the guy who invites U.S. and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city employs 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In urban daycare centres, the clock is turned back.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban children’s day care facilities (Kitas) again in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
Cooking continues to take place outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked refrigerated food.
The city operates 46 daycare centres in the Krefelder area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the kita," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time staff have kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are firmly assigned to a kita,” says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hours.
“The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team,” says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for kite management".
This is also about: healthy food and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
Continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - hitherto also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant – the separation of cleaning and kitchen service – has in addition to the quality improvement of kitchen performance also the charm that it has proven itself to be the most economical in terms of cost management and outsourcing for the city, according to the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are being re-hired.
“But these hours aren’t so heavy for about 750 people in the education sector,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unrestrictedly and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
For the first time this year, the elections will be peacefully handed over power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were reported to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police reports, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße, at about 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl’s cell phone.
However, the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl’s cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
The duo escaped without prey.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie plant in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure the managers of the biscuits manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be “the first to know” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's urged "to express concern that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and workers are focusing heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued involvement of employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all of our business areas and locations – to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our toll cross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and should our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know about this."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago before Neymar?
The page of La Liga may regret your interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not drop in her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record-breaking assault?
The sensational approach has warmed the transfer window this summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
Upon completion, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers salaries of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona are furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done their best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago of this prospect?
When Manchester City announced interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG’s best players sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, that will have consequences.”
Barcelona seem to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their bids for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus inflicted damage of more than 200 euros on the disguise of the vehicle.
The Schramberg Police Department, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for information.
In an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because he met a car on his driveway, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the dashboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on his way to Leese with his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau at around 7.55 p.m.
In the area around the town of Stolzenau, a car met him on his driveway, so he had to skip to the right.
The Touran driver touched the dashboard.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the receiving car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the injured party, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the causative vehicle to contact the Commissariat in Stolzenau at tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses relieves Pope’s brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus.
It would be of great use to the Catholic Church’s reputation if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets about their own omissions or their misjudgment of their actions at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticised the fact that when reporting on violence at the domes, it is measured with "two dimensions".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Bioethic of Italy.
“The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider that normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to church and that's a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "strike was a very normal educational means" "to get over with naughty children like I was one".
They felt it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuses, Pope’s brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
Totally wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoir "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger's protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, a lawyer commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg for the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspats were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s with "high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspats.
The final report mentions Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, therefore, it can be noted that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence were applied by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims value R.'s general humanity and, therefore, in many cases, in spite of violence, even associate positive memories with him".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspats relieves Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against those in command of the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize their "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholericist and perfectionist, who became more often handy when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you rate this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even appears in it.
He has eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of accomplice or accomplice in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence incidents at the preschool also took place outside of its sphere of influence.
In any case, he may be accused of being too late to hear about it or of not taking his first statements seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "rescue", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger exhibits a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warmhearted", "loved", "honest", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely benevolent teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candy.
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which even once led to outbursts of anger.
That he not only banged with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed earrings and dragged too mad boys to the hair or ears, he himself has already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.
It must be said, however, that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you know any other methods of soothing?
Of course, I think of each of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is really about, namely, the terrible sexual abuse and the violence in preschool, that is the free bagatelle.
One wonders if it has more to do with his fame and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
Many people who have never understood the Bavarian pope still work diligently.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In connection with the report, a great deal has been reported in the media on the topic of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or coercion with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Absolutely no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never got engaged to talk to my father or my mother about it," one affected representative told the others, "I was very embarrassed about everything."
The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was, and yet, that most victims are silent.
If they did not entrust themselves to their parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in relation to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student questioned put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that it turns out to be him... Bubbles have opened up more intrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, international leaders, trust teachers etc.
Talking to him about sex is...unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that the students concerned in advance and/or their environment were entrusted to him, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free from any cowardice.
Nor can he be accused of not having been prevented or brought to the public notice.
Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these repulsive crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was a lot of "violence" in the media at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Looking away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem, that in the reporting, everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
This, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspats, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible pedagogy, the cases in which boys were genuinely harassed and mistreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys in the face when they were already in the Domkapellgymnasium.
On it was, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" taboo.
They were just happy to have escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different about Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And the same goes for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him".
At the very least, there is still the charge of looking away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and from the actions at a school where he was just not acting and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "the beating penalty will continue to be practiced in preschool".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent entry.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were banned in Bavaria for a long time.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected may have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
I can’t say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the penalty for beating schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking here about the “fall of anachronism”, i.e. the danger of assessing the past by today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was atrocious, nor to what was violated in the preschool to repulsions and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the usual at the time.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. earplugs and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of the penalty of beatings also come into play?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the domspats played only a side role.
However, I do not deny that he was leading a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class from the previously more nationally known Regensburger Domspatts, on the basis of the true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its two musical traditions (1988) and the United States (1983) and its two musical traditions.
With biscuits and candy alone, you don’t make great singers and every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcome.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, profoundly faithful and heartfelt people who you cannot imagine that he could do anything to hurt even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspats are still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most Domspats are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but he was also a kindly respectable person, whom they still look up to today and whom they worship right now.
And please, once again, make it very clear: all that is being accused of is the methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have been through this time for a long time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media sin-bock.
There is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious.
Because the report that was just published relieves him.
Now, a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, no one would know the Regensburg Cathedral, would finally leave him in peace.
