Parliament does not support the novel that liberates Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the paragraph under the new Criminal Code, on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the inmate, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the proposal to mitigate penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not valid, the defendant’s appeal is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the verdict as a political revenge of the regime, suspicion of the court's interest has also triggered a trial in the West.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 from the criminal code, on the basis of which the prime minister was convicted, supported 147 members in the vote.
It required 226 votes to be cast.
Category: Libyan victories
The story of the Liberation of Libya, or Libyan Rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the election, but it is a question of whether it is moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to the customary law of sharia and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, for theft cuts off the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith await execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we can’t imagine and that we certainly wouldn’t want.
But our way of life is not the only one or objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans mentioned for change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters took credit with the help of non-believing dogs.
The only regret is that, from their point of view, NATO was not in charge of the raids by some American general, but by Allah, the size of which they celebrated with every successful intervention.
So when the winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militarily occupy Libya.
In this case, the problem with the expulsion of "crucifixes" disappears locally.
But will the Libyan oil company have black gold as a smelter without occupation?
Perhaps they will not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of the unscrupulous protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, the Shari'ah's followers have given it to us.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors.
On Tuesday, there was a statistical decline across Europe.
Individual states have released data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated inter-quarterly, and Germany and France are growing.
Today, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany next to it was better than expected (up 0.3% from the original 0.1%), but France said it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the GDP stagnated over the quarter, and according to the Czech Republic, the trend of gradual slowing the growth of the economy’s performance was confirmed.
The results are worse than analysts estimate.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarterly.
According to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
Greece’s economy fell by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Revenues from Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical frontiers.
Problems are also beginning to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Revenues for Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro won 1-0 and celebrates the procession for 200 million
The football team has managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goal Petra Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ka won 1-0.
Czech football, even with a lot of luck in the second half, took a luxury leap from home and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progression match in a detailed reportage.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech national team, also thanks to the domestic struggle in the final, the great Czech and hero Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
Due to the precise defense of the Czech whole, the Montenegrins got under pressure until the second half.
The shooters of the match became Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vucini<0xC4><0x8D>, who burned two great chances.
Thanks to the great Peter <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the prize of around 200 million kroner will be added to the national football fund.
From the very beginning, a lot of fighting football has been played.
Both teams were hard to get involved in the combination and played mostly around the half-line.
The pressure of the domestic footballers did not come even in the first half, because the Czech defense accurately deflected the long pitfalls for the defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
By their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program against a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the building on Tuesday afternoon and then caused the deaths of the United States and Israel.
Hundreds of students from universities in Iran’s Isfahan have created a live shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center that processes uranium on Tuesday.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran has apparently not stopped its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
There is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then caused the deaths of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting the Iranian nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said that in addition to the Isfahan center, a facility in Natanz that enriches uranium would also be targeted.
The diet of an obese child: breakfast and dinner
More than a third of 9 to 13-year-olds have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren overweight and 5 percent of obese children.
Obese children usually come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to a recent study.
Again, it shows how important the environment in which he grows and the patterns in which he is surrounded is for the healthy development of man.
For example, on the tables of obese children, cucumbers appear up to half more often than in families of normal weight children.
The roasted fries had to dinner the day before the research associated with an educational event called Obesity is no coincidence more than 19 percent of obese.
It is also not a habit to play sports in fat families, which is true for most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children.
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity Action is not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 pupils from 4th to 8th grade have been involved in the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors, which causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
“Only half of those surveyed, for example, said they ate breakfast-breakfast-lunch-dinner five times a day, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition,” says one of the survey results.
Without breakfast and evening cessation
Experts note that for healthy development there are also important relative details, including, for example, the regular time of family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone has their own breakfast.
And the worst was the finding that in a tenth of the households do not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy french fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade (70 percent) every day.
Although more than 40 percent of children surveyed regularly exercise, the result was less than half - 15 percent for their parents.
Set up your own diet.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own dietary options according to their own taste and opinion.
"The nutritional preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of mellow, masturbating and sweet dishes.
“The great popularity of sweet lemonade is particularly alarming,” the study’s final report states.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta won just over poultry.
The children, however, practically did not want peanuts at all and low is the popularity of fish and mid-vegetable dishes.
An Inclination to Health
At the same time, the study showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In a control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the Obesity education lecture, there was a significant shift in preferences towards healthy eating principles in a number of cases," the results of the project said.
This was significant, for example, in the case of sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children also more often turned on poultry and fish in the questionnaire as the main meal of the day and would limit sweet foods and snacks.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, says the professional
In the initial article on how stylists learn, I complained a little that there was already a lot of it in the initial classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing up problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the square.
And it'll be worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "found".
This time, Alenka and I discussed (there is not only a boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly proportional figure.
And that's the vast majority of them.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy figure with no real curves, and someone's overweight.
The stylist needs to know how to optically narrow the wide shoulders, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips as for a woman of the type Jennifer Lopez, that is, larger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, to emphasize the character nicely and at the same time not to dress the woman too inquisitively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the sides is such that the skirt or pants do not really fit, then it is worthwhile to have at least one such piece tailored.
You will not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothing is unpaid.
In a tailored dress you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, folds, stays in the waist and so on.
The boy character can again afford to wear clothes with eyelashes, applications, embroidery or pick-up.
Of course, there are a lot of such information and types of characters, so I’m glad I have a whole week to put all the information in my head.
And I'm also afraid that because of the assigned homework, that's all.
Each of the course participants received an assigned celebrity, who is to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of a given personality and the character type.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, I am definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained a hundred pounds (please take into account the excess), or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print and then process them graphically.
Moodboard, as the whole result is said, then also expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic rendering.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for a specific assignment, for example, the trends of handbags, jackets, etc.).
This was told by stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But not until Sunday.
A stylist must have a general overview
The Saturday lecture was filled with information about the types of characters, and immediately three guests from the industry were impressed.
Stylist Honza Humorous, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a shirt as a coat, but you can also dress it on the bare body, wrap the boots and photograph it as a dress.
Or just pull out your sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different right away.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start violating them," Jacob said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we are breaking all the lessons, what to combine with, why, when we see something different in fashion magazines too.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist has to have a lot more clothes ready than how many can be photographed.
So for the fashion story, which will have ten pages (then ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of lecdy completely different than in reality.
So we have to count on this when creating an outfit.
That the image and the style make up half of the success, Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> confirmed to us.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a wonderful singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces of him seem to consider it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look at it, is second-rate).
And if someone already lets us create styling, then we have to count on the fact that it is very likely to dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than it really does.
Then all you have to do is google and find out if the boulevard wrote about the celebrity being smothered/lost and so on.
Honza and Mario told us on Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to orient themselves in fashion and to be able to arrange outfits.
In his work, he communicates mainly with the people he wears, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to be subordinated, to become according to your opinion.
"When some manager orders you to sort out her wardrobe and add nice pieces to it, you can't throw out the whole wardrobe and say, for God's sake, it's terrible."
“Find there at least a few things you praise and recommend what they can be worn for,” says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything has to contain the so-called "plaque", or bag of plaque.
It is the one that you turn on around your waist and you have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to the clear things such as scissors, hair rollers or locking spindles, there are also nylon threads (with which the stylist helps to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which we fasten the ribbons or ribbons behind the clothes, if the ribbons are larger or the ribbons are larger.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly glue the shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, even outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We must not even touch the shoes with scissors, so that they are not damaged by accident.
There is a real need for skill.
Mario delighted me when he praised my creation unreservedly.
The above-mentioned skill is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It’s becoming increasingly clear to me that doing styling on a professional level isn’t really a walk with a pink set, no matter who wants to say what they want.
Need for Speed: The Run takes place across the United States.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Review
Originally, a carefree ride turns into a routine morning trip to a sleigh due to a series of unnecessary rare errors.
While the ambition has been largely fulfilled, it is not valid if no one has apparently wanted to do anything more.
A new song, titled The Run, was born before the release of the album.
He promised that in the summer of the Need for Speed racing series would once again move a bit in a new direction, and from playable demonstrations it appeared as a game that in the genre of action racing would not have to be just in numbers.
We were also curious as to how the inserted passages in which the main hero will get out of the car and run on his own.
As with the NFS series, however, many are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more or less a few years.
So these are not actually mistakes, but rather an expression of some incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to the story, whose protagonist Jack has certain problems of a personal character and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel you will sit on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea carries with it a number of interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
As a result, each race goes on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t even have the feeling that the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing mundane.
But driving across the desert, in the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seems visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are occasionally infused with some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you get stuck in a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility.
In contrast, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to be swept away by avalanches.
In addition, the individual races are placed quite well behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that is enough.
For a while, you try to advance the required number of opponents (in essence a classic race), then you again gain time (a classic fight with the feet) and then you have a duel with a single opponent waiting for you.
From time to time, the police will also be involved, which makes all your efforts even more uncomfortable.
The news is the passages outside the car.
It’s more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
It's not complicated.
Surprisingly, however, these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (specifically, maybe even just three).
As a result, however, this is in favor of the thing, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above it ranks among the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that it is no longer a nuisance these days, but it cannot be said that it would be a lockdown.
If you’re looking for a realistic simulation, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-packed racing here still fits the model quite well, even though we could find better ones in the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Problems are beginning to emerge after a while.
Unlike the model of a car, the model is no longer a collision model.
We do not expect this type of game to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how your car will be maintained, then probably not everything is completely okay.
Typically, during a narrow pass or passing of cars in normal traffic, sometimes you only slightly lick each other, but at other times in an almost identical situation, your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even attack it right away.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t bother you at all, but it will reliably distract you.
Restarts are resolved in such a way that, if you break or travel far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
However, there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race all over again.
So it’s more of a help in case something doesn’t work out than you can rely on it explicitly.
But sometimes even restarts will not help, it will solve them when it is necessary to learn the particular part of the race to remember.
The big draw of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves need to be crossed in a specific way, otherwise you won’t fit into them.
At other times, you will find "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
Angry, especially in situations where you see an opponent passing through between two opposing cars easily in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
It doesn’t matter when you get to them, because it’s “calculated” so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
During the entire duration of the game you will encounter several places where, again, no matter the time, the same opponent will always overtake you in the same place.
The most it hits at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
Your opponent must get there in front of you at all costs.
When driving in front of you, you get a worse view of the anti-driving cars, so you’ll be there a couple of times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-intensive, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably dislike you quickly.
And it’s a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and places and so action-packed that sometimes you literally don’t want to watch what’s flying.
And basically it doesn’t matter if it’s a concept with fifty unique tracks, arranging the races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to replace cars during races.
You have to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the way, because that’s where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you’ll have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Athletes are suitable for urban areas, strong U.S. highway boulders and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example, on rugged mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand as well as the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
In order to obtain a higher level of the driver, different objects are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, it is re-connected with the online Autolog feature, which among other things compares your results with other players and provides additional community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand pitfalls is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you get to the subway tunnel (budiz), where you get married in the dark after the tracks (budiz).
The tachometer gives you numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (behind) and in it comes a subway set from the back and uncompromisingly picks you up.
In the editorial board, we will have a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought about the game, or whether the authors really think we are such a big fool.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It’s a pity that in some of the more intense moments, the shooting decreases, and in some cases, it’s quite tragic.
However, this is especially the case with a larger number of participants, when the smooth shooting would no longer apply to you.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack was created from the category "every dog is a different village", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music someone will probably not buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so much disappointing.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS work in the last few years.
This is how the game works unfinished.
Fun is definitely fine, but be prepared for mistakes that will be rubbed into your eyes by the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation settles down a bit, calms down and all players get used to their new role," the Czech ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
The extent to which she takes her motto "Understandably and openly about Europe" seriously has already been shown in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that a number of lecturers from the Law School could have been given to her.
The Vice-President also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, there was criticism that it was insignificant, that he was a gray official, that he couldn’t play any role, and I have to say that everyone took a breath, that he played that role excellently.”
"He is a man who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them well and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in response to the question: "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?", that is, as a significant step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards countries like India.
No one wants to ban orphans.
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
Last year’s Czech Presidency declared it a success.
The Czechs addressed the impending financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis, or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time marked a major negative, which severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, the "fact frmol" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being addressed to this day.
In addition, a new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is considerably complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and economical, which sectors will be given an advantage, which countries will be supported more and which will be supported less, that is all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "The loss of Europe in a comprehensible way".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, a hamster that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that there are really no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of varying sizes, or that we really have to ban sausages.”
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you meeting, what are your Visegrad four?' and he doesn't look excited at it at all."
The future of the Union, according to the Vice-President, is ahead of the tough new rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
The concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, is very real, rather than a new "European federation."
“We have a country outside the eurozone and a country outside the eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries who want to cooperate and those who don’t want to stand behind.”
“There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe,” Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between eurozone countries.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of its Existence
If someone were looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM’s strategy, the closest would probably be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation for this long term was laid by the company’s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already broken the motto that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" thus became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the title of an internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking is a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve even more," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current CEO of the company.
An elaborated system
In the 1930s, Watson took care of his employees just like the businessman of Bata in the Czech Republic - the people at IBM, as one of the first U.S. employees, had paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee’s best-dressed uniform and a well-developed system.
IBM also has a long-term relationship with its customers.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant at harnessing talent – as one of the first companies in the world to abolish any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will replace IBM next year with a woman – Virginia Rometty.
IBM has been in business for 30 years, and is still the leader in sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called “online brainstormings,” from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in the business ensures the company’s strong internal and external image.
“In the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,” said Professor of Economics at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems by using technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating a market evenly.
IBM – or “Big Blue” as it is known for its logo in the United States – has grown into one of the world’s largest companies in a hundred years.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company – developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the most patents from all of America’s technology companies, and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a debit card, a financial swap, a bar code or a disk.
IBM, with about $220 billion this year, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft since 1996.
A Look Forward
Not all products and innovations have hit the taste of customers and times - IBM, for example, has failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally cling to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms – and if they don’t work, then leave them.
Unlike, for example, the competitor Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM’s market share of services is highest, with about one-fifth of them being software and hardware.
In 1990, he was the strongest representative of hardware with more than half of the shares.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performing assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
Investment has been going on since 2008, when the world’s modern-day financial crisis was overrun for the first time.
IBM is acting according to a reference to its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investments during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis unaffected.
IBM’s share price has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, with the company’s net profit continuously rising.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything, but not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM's History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded a hundred years ago in New York City and was originally called the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over only in 1924 - it was originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM merged four companies whose history goes back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as the famous "switches," i.e. clocks recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired the company’s Supervisory Board.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, head of the rival company, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founders of IBM – Watson’s thoughts are still built on the invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began manufacturing and selling all kinds of machines for business – from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson has managed the company, it doubled its turnover to $9 million and began a massive expansion of the company to all parts of the world.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after nearly forty years in the boss’s chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous man's flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers – the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pécéchique," which was established by the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, was released in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer manufacturing to Chinese company Lenovo, bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to devote itself fully to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, the “smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make smart use of technologies in unplanned areas so far, and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban management.
For the commerce sector, IBM has recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in India.
It established its branch in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
The Bridegroom of an Infidel Husband:
Iveto, keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>ra (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she does not intend to wait and has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> gave Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> asylum in her house in the summer, she apparently did not even know how her marriage would end.
Even though Iveta moved out of <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days on her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
As time went on, Darina gave up her relationship with her husband, and now she even said good-bye to him forever.
The rider doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Knight and Bartosha parted only once, his wife’s open arm would not wait for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him out."
"But he will live not as my beloved, misguided old donkey, but as a man with whom I have a certain connection," said the Knight, with the fact that she has already departed from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina closed the back door to Joseph doesn't bother him yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I are having quite normal sex, except that we don't share beds together," said the Lightning Rider.
If the Knight had found a new love, he would not have held it back.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, and if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Josef concluded.
Worst Women’s Bad Habits: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men if they would be able to name out some typical female bad habits, as a rule, all in one is very readily ejected from the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where are listed several female bad habits that can perfectly dissolve the blood in the veins for men?
Purchasing
Does your second half tell you that you are addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one bag a week?
Do you like to shop and shop in bulk at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least cut off their shopping passion a little bit.
But tell me, who would resist it just to walk around the clothing stores, look for well-matched tops and then try them all (ideally in different colored designs) in the cabin?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become literally a ready-made hell.
Just remember how many times you've told your friend that he'd rather wait for you in front of the door...
Continuous Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Doesn’t this phrase remind you of anything?
Is that so?
Then you are one of those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite circle.
Washing the windows, vacuuming, wiping the tiles, dusting, shaking the bathtub - at least twice a week.
Are you telling your partner that he kicked his dirty feet on a clean tile, kids that they smeared the smashed sink and smeared the glass living wall with which you put so much work into polishing?
In case you suffer from this very "deviation", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not happen within the family in the first place.
This innocuous desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationships as well as your family’s well-being.
R<0xC3><0xAD>p<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>
"You used trainers throw in the basket."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"Wet wipes don't belong on the ground."
If you rub your partner like this several times a day, know that this way you can reliably shoot him.
Of course, you don’t mean it bad, you want to make sure everything is okay.
Maybe, if men knew, women wouldn't have to crawl into them again so much...
Cheating, sneezing
For some women, there are also gossip, gossip, but also insults and socializing against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I hope that each of us will drop some innocuous snail or snail in here.
Hand to heart, it's probably all women's.
However, they are shreds of the crumbiest grain, which they like and often shred, perhaps despise everyone, and are especially dangerous for their environment – especially within the women’s work group.
Jagr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in Monday's NHL game with two assists to win Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina ice and is once again at the forefront of Czech players' productivity in the competition.
From the review of the thirty-nine-year-old star he raced in both cases Claude Giroux, who added another record and was named the best player of the match.
Jagr's teammate Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the match.
After the match, Jagr told reporters abroad that he had predicted a big evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the match to give him a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," explained Jagr, after which Giroux scored the first shot of the Flyers.
A few minutes later, the second intervention of the team also had a Czech footprint.
The foreman fought a disc for the Hurricanes goal and presented it to the scoring Maxim Talbot among the circles.
The second before the first break was reduced in the weakening home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After collaborating with J<0xC3><0xA1>gre, he scored a third goal, then crossed his shot running in the fourth goal Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," Jagr said.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play it."
"All those years in the NHL my teammates tried to play against me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Carolina from the match still made a drama, with Tuoma Ruutua's goal and again Dwyer, who came out of the penalty shootout, got the difference of one goal.
However, Matt Read did not allow another complication, which ended the renumbering of two to one.
"Excellent strike in our Pronger belt."
"He blew the disc, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to a more distant bar."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the final goal of the match from his point of view.
With the victory, Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not win the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens lost the two-sided lead in a 2–3 penalty shootout.
One of their landings was not changed by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekenec.
The home coach, rather than losing points, was hated by a large back rower, scoring only five defenders in the match.
"It's bad."
"We only managed the match with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We've been hit by alternating orders, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game more, move the puck out of our range."
We had gaps in that,” added one of the P.K. Subban defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty wins to Winnipeg’s 5–2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets, who interrupted a five-yard series of goals, were split by five different shooters.
How tour prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in what was then Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold in the vast majority only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus traveled on holiday to the sea to the DDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia was subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a calling letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand on the front overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the travel agency.
However, it was not even won.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to “politically unreliable people” who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange pledge it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the trip to the West.
By far the most common, however, the Czechs spent their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs acquired and this habit survives to this day.
Thus, the travel of the Czechs experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While by 1989 vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria was our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries all over the world.
The huge paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to the most popular Croatia for us at the moment until 1989, as it was part of then Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 1990s, the visa requirement for neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, which triggered a huge wave of short-term visits to Austria, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czechs’ trips to the parks in the tents fell asleep, as our incomes at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of Czech travel at this time was driving your own food, cans, salads, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchangeable Czech krona, so that our tourists could finally buy Western currency freely for many decades.
However, our standard of living and, as a result, average wages have increased, leading to another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare flights by charter air connections since 1997, which has reduced air travel by means of the possibility of contracting quantitative discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had already had visa-free contacts to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight to exotica was taken from the Czech Republic, it was to Thailand.
From this year onwards, Czech tourists fly direct charters to warm faraway countries every year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs each year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States revoked the visa for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent on one foreign holiday including the cost of accommodation more than CZK 15 thousand per person.
The general assembly is to find the president, but again threatens to fail
For almost five months, Czech football is without a chairman and the successor Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburg.
There is still no agreement on what kind of electoral procedure will be followed.
Without it, no vote will begin on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interested in leading Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Hasek resigned in June and on his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after the Hague, football slipped back to the gaps between the two union chambers, which could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the general assembly sat in the National House in Prague on Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov in vain, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a way of election.
There was no consensus as to who had the right to vote in the assembly - whether only the statutory representatives or even the officials of the delegation with full power.
At this single point there has been a partial agreement since then, which was also helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Controversy still prevails over the electoral system.
The situation was not too clear even by the Executive Committee, which, in its proceedings, whether proper or extraordinary, essentially did not solve anything else.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a pat?
"The question is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or to find another model," said one of the three vice presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the one of the candidates will win, who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
Morava is said to be willing to resign to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of the vote from both chambers.
And the Czech side insists that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds predominance in this percentage count.
"But it would take away the meaning of the previous two rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Freedom Party, according to which it would be best to not flex and vote according to the current statutes.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, even though it is estimated that the electoral system determined by the statutes is most suited to Pelt of all candidates.
"I wish to be elected as much as possible according to the statutes."
"In order not to invent any representative nonsense as at the last general meeting," said owner Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his remarks was mainly against Pelt.
Pelta is still optimistic.
In Nymburg, he said, the new president will be known and he believes that the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All the passions will be reassured by the eventual progress of the national team today at the European Championships."
"Football will once again be on a happy wave, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says Apple, who of the three has the greatest experience in managing football at both the professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very fragmented."
"It is not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to purposely adapt the regulations."
"It may cause the general assembly to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some of the negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match.
The aircraft special, in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things vice-presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical fault and was looking for a replacement, as part of the executive committee to the site of the barrage repair.
In the end, there may be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, which may be held on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1> would like to bring the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There are many things in the game: state grants, the credibility of football and also the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
He’s running for president because he doesn’t see a suitable candidate.
If Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the footballers of Pilsen, had seen a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have signed up for the fight for top office.
"If there was a good adept, I would fight for him and I wouldn't go to the polls."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a person," said <0xC4><0x8C>TK Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In a fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k takes the motivation to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the elections, from leading the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also emphasizes that in the event of his victory in the role of president, he would only last until 2013, when there is a proper general assembly on the program.
In the role, he would like to see an experienced and cutting-edge manager who is not too connected to the football event.
"I've been talking to some people who'd come to mind."
“It was crazy for me when some people said they didn’t even want to identify with Czech football at this point.”
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
According to Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, Pelt’s association with the president of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbrem, is now the most disturbing thing about him, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, it is so unacceptable for Pelta to stand as president.
"If he wins, he retains his current position and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled trader, it would not benefit football even more," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also points out that Pelt's name was heard years ago in the hearings during the investigation of a corruption affair, from which Pelta came without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
“And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who is also taking into account his former statement that he would “sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became president.”
However, if Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k triumphed in Thursday’s election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
He also considers another candidate Rajchl, whom Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I'd go after."
"He has great abilities."
"I could have imagined him as the head of the team."
"But managerially, he couldn't run the association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I don't understand it," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September drew great attention by standing behind the appeal of the jury headed by Lud<0xC3><0xAD>k Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The clerk says he's going to run the association.
He draws on his ability to manage private companies, since last summer he also heads Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the Premier League triumph in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to its particular cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may have a tendency to influence disciplinary and appeals committees, which deals with unpleasant situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who did not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan chief Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nské.
One of his priorities would also be to undermine FA<0xC4><0x8C>R’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should do."
"If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties state, I understand their arguments, but at the same time they have to say where the money will go," he said.
As a pretext now, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k does not even take his association with the Pilsen club, even though he himself claims that the president of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "surpassing".
Pelta is reunited with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Ducola.
"It's not ideal."
“But I don’t see any point in transferring my shares to someone in a Pilsen club and in a year and a half he will be back there,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the Czech Republic that would exclude the electoral pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for president Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of an election, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will have new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic ahead of Thursday’s meeting in Nymburg and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly hamper the possible success of today’s football team.
Pelta had already promised before the September election that it was precisely the representation and the acquisition of finance that he intends to focus in the event of the election.
He decided to go to the election before last year’s general election at the last minute, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to defend his ideas about managing football and present it in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a very long time and expect to know the president on Thursday.”
"It feels like it's time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is primarily associated with the Apple Club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
He also believes that he has enough experience to be able to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that there is euphoria behind the current problems with choice, which prevailed during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>k.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If there were no different interpretations, we had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civil society association that he took as a handful of delegates.
“If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if I fail.”
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He said he is still trying not to defend himself against his opponents.
He announced earlier that he could imagine collaborating with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and well knows that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack Thomas Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a long time, who, on the other hand, did not leave a dry thread on Pelt.
“He’s been playing football for over a year, he’s already had some successes.”
"However, his attacks were disrespectful and he surprised many people in the way of the election campaign."
"That's why many of them are now doubting his true character," he said to the opponent's address, Pelta, who is said to remain faithful to the proclamations he announced as early as September.
According to him, his most powerful weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
This should be an explanatory closet of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians causation or the echoes of last year's corruption scandal."
“I would immediately go to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure that we have enough money for the whole of football,” the forty-six-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his coming to the forefront of football would not mean any personal cleanup.
"I should first get acquainted with the filling of individual employees," he pointed to Strahov, where from a long time ago there was understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompanies the general assembly, he believes delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how he will vote in the third round, we will be able to get through it."
“Football needs credibility, and it’s only by finally having its leader back,” Pelta said two days before the decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If the former vice-president Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the general meeting on Thursday, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that he will start working hard in the event of his election.
It wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football, and continue the work started by the previous president, Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national team, professional football, performance football after the youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I'm a team player and I want to split the competencies on the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a specific area."
"And I'm going to give a hard task to keep football a mile ahead in every segment."
“A lot of people would probably not be happy about it because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he would not run again.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw their heels under my feet and question my every step," he explained.
“A lot of people told me I couldn’t give up, because then others would give up.”
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Haskem.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that will have a tone in a few years' time, and I would not like someone to stop them," he said, with concerns that if another candidate is elected, the situation on the union could return to the time before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>k.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something Mirek Pelt, in my opinion, can't do."
“It’s mainly about people who would make football so it’s only for the chosen ones.”
"A lot of things can be attributed to me, but it's certainly not that I side with someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the choices," Rajchl said.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech president.
"Even though some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would be no current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the club in Pilsen, was also involved in the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman, and see that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers the savings of tens of millions of kroner on unfavorable contracts, locomotives and television deals as his successes.
On the contrary, it is assumed that the bundle does not stretch over one rope.
While he says about Pelt that he is "disqualified from returning Czech football to trust", the second of Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k's rivals considers him a strong candidate who has football to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue with the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the committees."
"He wouldn't want to turn it in his favor," says rival Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
From the Ufona’s point of view, a breathtaking pool in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle – and after exploring cities or traveling let their tired feet rest in the thermal spas.
The book will show you where wellness is most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder spent the past one-and-a-half years on discovery trips, her suitcases were not to be missed: her swimsuits.
Lying on the water, she looked up to the height of the artfully shaped domes, she was swimming in front of the marble pit (I build a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) who were waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored secession.
If she liked one of the floats, she put it in her notebook in the mud - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimmers explored in this way the historical architecture of the Meder and presents them now in their just published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) ": People's swimmers in Munich, the historical palace of swimmers in the Schwarzwald, "The Hard Core of the Concrete Buildings.
13 countries led it by its "Road to the Most Unusual Spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Lucemburg.
The 46-year-old German is a true fan of the sailing culture.
It’s not too much of a sport, says Meder – it’s just something else in the water.
The only thing to get angry about is that fan swimming has to settle for blue ducks and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating smell of snail forests or listen to the cheerful glittering of birds in the park.
“One day, I asked why swimmers always have to be so ugly,” says Ms. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"That's how I started collecting nice swimmers."
The water level doubles the architecture
Splashing in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimmers could be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of the floor, a man has a bathing water level."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: a high vault, a multi-faceted roof, a jumping board.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) " provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic wellness oasis - but above all, it excites the desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by Mrs. Meder’s float collector during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful healing spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water containing nitrogen in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal baths in the Term<0xC3><0xA1>v<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>t (the pools of which are filled with alkaline water in a shallow tub).
A beautiful view on the opposite side is offered by many heated swimming pools under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. While one has from the Curonian rooftop swimming pool in the eyes of the whole city, a canopy can be found in the outdoor swimming pool, a steam room is a spa in St. Anton.
Perhaps the most notable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like an ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From the top of the three open pans in the winter, the steam rises while the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Mountains face the sky.
Alhambra and the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder's pool collector's scent of chlorine climbed into the gutter.
Many thermal baths are feeling after sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d spa in Békescsab<0xC3><0xA1>b Hungary it smells after heating oil to the extent that one can hardly believe that one has gotten into the spa treatments.
The odor comes from the healing water with the content of alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose deposits rest on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she ran into a closed area.
In 1902, the spas designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x87> were closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the windows of the red-white-yellow buildings, she saw how the grass grew enormously between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood in the magic swimming pool in the Schwarzwald: in the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three stages of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements that date back to their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favorite spa for pool expert Iris Meder, not only because it comes from the Schwarzwald.
“It’s already some kind of performance, combining such a variety of building styles into such a wonderful complex,” says Ms. Meder.
For such a palace, immersing yourself in a thermal pool is obviously a fringe matter.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank to Inspect Commodity Trade
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving its trade in agricultural commodities?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the thing is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize, according to one study.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this trade because it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices upwards, and that banks therefore contribute to the global problem of hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is targeted specifically against Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, even though big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trades have drifted away from supply and demand – and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike rivals in the United States, he responded to Ackermann’s criticism: He promised to check the extracts and said that no trade “does not deserve to have the good reputation of Deutsche Bank put at stake”.
According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group checks the extracts from the Foodwatch-Report.
The audit will be closed by the end of the year and the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, together with a recommendation on how to do so.
At the end of January, the representatives of the bank will then announce what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the trade in commodities or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works with self-help on his image.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: “Sitting at rising food prices shows particularly drastic how recklessly banks today are harming the general welfare.”
Let Ackermann, as the supreme bank lobbyist, have a duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items where money is used for bets on food prices," Bode said.
"I wonder if it's Mr. Ackermann's hunger-stricken people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s outlook seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors would not go to the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
By deflecting disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he does not have to worry about possible losses - he should finally consult his successor.
Every second would give up investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 per cent believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that are linked to bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: Every other bank would, as a result of a survey, cancel all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would warn a known bank of such a bank, 49 percent said they are thinking about canceling their account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Relocated Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endems: The Austrian Pavilion from the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When it comes to modern post-war architecture, bright forms, glass halls, bold scales and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion is an example of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and impressive steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
The architect was famous for building the Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibitions.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder palace plus as a key built by a side building in Munich, it gained international fame at the end of 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, a pavilion designed after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Südbahnhof in Vienna, reconstructed and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, either spatially or technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the present art came to a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly empty.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a significant career, e.g. as a young skater, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, has been actively involved in the reconstruction of urology and urology.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruby should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookshop should be established, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, low budget.
After all, Krischanitz was the ideal cast.
Not only did he delicately reconstruct and expand the centuries-old buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he studied at the Schwanzer Technical University in Vienna and the pavilion was a "immeasurably important place" for him.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when he moved to Vienna and changed its use.
During the current reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was a “catapult for energy,” says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the windows of the glass facade were replaced, used glass fiber reinforced insulation glass and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge-steel carriers were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings sanitized.
The two underground floors provided space for new use, the abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, the entrance leads to the bridge - almost a new building, but still a glorious Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door is preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown tone.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the memorial office and a low budget.
“He often had to find material that was good and cheap and also liked the memorial office,” says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult, he said, with the pavilion, "that came here from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such an architecture is said to be “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “awaken proper self-confidence”.
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, as an urbanistic lucky coincidence occurred: In the district around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter near the Main Station" with office and residential houses is created.
And perhaps there will be another lucky coincidence: the 21st-century house could receive support from another Krishanitza building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already negotiating with the city about the neighborhood at the Garitzer site.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis in the amount of a million
The track has outlined a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is publishing more than 70 million euros this year, according to a report in the newspapers.
The "Bild" newspapers brought a preliminary report with a reference to the internal group plan, which is said to count on a total investment of around 300 million euros by 2015.
It is said to be used to make better use of trains and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people for the removal of snow at railway facilities and access points.
The aim is to get rid of the start-up platform and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary outposts in the course of four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the route Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives of train failures and delays also during this winter.
In the last winter period, the track had significant problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, delays in ICE train journeys are addressed.
For years, the track has also been unable to cope with the fact that the ICE trains have to be checked more often by workshops when an ICE train at Cologne’s main station destroyed the trains.
Deutsche Bank pays a million dollar fine in the United States
After a stir around Josef Ackermann’s boss, there are new trampolines in the US: Deutsche Bank must pay millions in damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank no longer had enough problems at home, its past in the U.S. has caught its eye: Frankfurt’s institution pays $145 million in one settlement procedure (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks in a financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator reports to a number of major banks that the cooperative banks have led false promises to buy financial products; that the risks have probably reduced.
Such securities lost a great deal of value during the crisis and smashed the banks into disrepair.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to bring the parties to court," a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank said.
The bank does not admit any guilt by settlement.
The same goes for Citigroup, which has pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the welcome of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is seeking compensation for billions of dollars in damages.
Now the completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also relied on other major banks and in the summer sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Mortgage-backed securities are the so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
They are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. bubble around real estate collapsed in 2007, it became fatal for a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Even though the events occurred a few years ago, now the banks are buzzing with a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits in order to obtain a correction or to make a mistake.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It highlights 18 international big banks that two U.S. state-run real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have disadvantaged about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank is also facing FHFA lawsuits, with more transactions totalling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be held liable for "substantial losses" without, of course, stating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
US investor Warren Buffett has always said he will not invest in IT and computers, as long-term development of companies will only be difficult to predict.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business news and changed his view on investment in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and is acquiring computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment in the financial world is considered to be a fit for a knight.
As a result, IBM's IT motherboard may now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought IBM’s $10.7 billion worth of shares since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM hadn’t heard of his involvement yet.
He praised the management, which was trying to make a decent profit during the economic crisis.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old pioneer of computers also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has avoided tech firms to this day.
He claims that he only invests in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a machine manufacturer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns some 80 of its own subsidiaries and shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the world’s most valuable companies with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha (The Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's stock rose by one percent before the stock market began.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total price tag of more than $220 billion and is considered to be the world’s most valuable technology companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, but he wouldn't want to act.
Bill Gates is said to be his best friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of "Zwickau Cells", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspapers even speak of a “blood ideology” that is now revived.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was reacted in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, this brings back the horror that has long been considered dead: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been in doubt.
The uncovered right-wing extremist network, however, reveals a range whose dimension has long since been unobservable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" were the headlines of the online publication of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should be a secret police agent of the Constitutional Protection Service and fears that German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted cautiously: It recalled the weekend of demonstrations by silence at the Brandenburg Gate victims of racist violence.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, remembered the solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colours, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
As a box here, the news of several Turkish media: "The Gift of Germany to the Fifties" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the publication of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany can not take to prevent this association of ideas.
"It's starting to smell," sounds the title of the column from Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that the people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany have been murdered.
Most critically discussed in the German-Turkish internet forums is the police’s process and its late success in the search.
Why didn’t the German authorities think much earlier to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many present themselves at least rhetorically ready for the use of drastic means: "If the activity continues to be carried out so superficially, migrants will have nothing but their own defence and armament."
“That’s probably the best defense.”
"The quality of clarification and proportionality of punishment of the entire network depends very heavily on internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What this means is that if internal peace is threatened in Germany, the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explain.
The photograph of the Solingen fire pit is deeply rooted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and retaliation can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks made the Turks more reciprocal.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
At the time, the Turkish press criticised the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but at a sad ceremony in Cologne, he was allowed to be represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech the fees paid by the Turks there.
It is as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his tax.
The current report by the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local state-law arrangement is.
In addition to efforts to provide ample clarification and a new evaluation of right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Skandal bank at Lake Zurich
The largest bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankrupt during the financial crisis and has since gone from one crisis to the next.
Now some German is going to compare it.
Axel Weber certainly didn’t think so.
After his noisy resignation from the leadership of the Federal Bank in July, it became known that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: the president of the board of the Swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber was pleased in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS reaches turnover".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September, it was clear that everything was going to be different.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only a recognized banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS has since also been burned down - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that the Weber bank has been allowed to operate since February 2012.
And we will take over the chairmanship of the board already in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and an issue banker, and he certainly would need some time to get a job.
At the same time, we will take responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which has once again proved itself worthy of the title “Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe”.
Because UBS is huge – until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world – and has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will not remain a proud Swiss bank spared.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid but also clever asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it has moved as an investment bank into the leagues of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, Hans Geiger, says: "I always gave my students UBS as an example of a good bank at the time."
"From today's point of view, one asks, 'How could I have been so wrong?'
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, surprise CEO Peter Wuffli resigned, who was still considered a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he wondered why he had left.
The bank's investment division broke the Subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to establish this, UBS has announced a real capital increase of 13 billion francs.
That’s why she actually found investors, of course, over whom she would have recently blunted her nose: the opaque Asian State Fund of Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one didn’t even know his name.
But it was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, and the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS stood before the financial crisis due to its incorrect investments and had to be saved by the state.
The Nationalbank has bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs to mandatory swapable bonds for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken – for it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times that of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“Once again, we couldn’t save UBS,” says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with the United States and expressed its willingness to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on unauthorised profits from these trades including a fine surcharge.
As a result, UBS was more or less open about helping to cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the shrine of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President of the Board of Directors.
And exodus of customers' money.
In the course of several months, the bank lost its credibility in both key business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to help cut taxes.
And just as it calmed down a bit again, just as it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate trade anabase: The only dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with risk management in investment banking, it’s probably still not working.
“In the case of Adoboli, it probably turned out that risk control changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of the big German bank is also confident: “The problem with UBS is that it can’t control the risks.”
But it was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers had long ago taken to become guardians of the world’s great assets: no too great risks, and therefore the security for money – the Alpine Republic has collapsed again on this side.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of inviolable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is even better suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank – it’s just a little bigger.
The location is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery such as Tiffany's can be found here among the traditional Swiss shops such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from the Nationalbank through the Palais der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
UBS enters the reception hall through heavy revolving doors.
Inside the walls are lined with marble, in front of them stands a huge leather chair, next to the logo of the bank a large guide to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.
However, the Swiss bank’s two Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have sometimes suppressed or betrayed this idea, as the head of one small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, eventually closing, like all Swiss bankers, also deals with both major banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything else to say.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS changed, brought it first high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as the Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was apparent.
“On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue action in the history of its nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks merged into a powerful group.
There was a bank that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger – and it continued to grow.
In doing so, the two different bank predecessors of UBS helped complement each other: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and a poorer but more internationally engaged bank.
All of a sudden, internationalized investment bankers came in handy for a lot of money with which they could spin big roulette.
With this rise, UBS is joined by two names: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffle, the highly intelligent, modest man who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who manages feelings around his stomach, who has been working from the banking sciences all the way up."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli in the end.
And Wuffli probably made the decisive mistakes in the end: “He probably thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of senior executives, at which Wuffli CEO repeated the same slogan over and over: “Smash Goldman Sachs from the Throne.”
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She introduced "League Tables", a newspaper that documents the success of the banks at the time.
In it, UBS was trying to place it all up.
Several steps have already been taken.
In the forex and stock trade, the games were all over the place.
However, the business advisers who have been commissioned highlight one weakness: in the international interest rate trade, in the bankers’ “Fixed Income” speech, there is probably a great distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS has some gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to embark on an adventure that was almost worth its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its venture fund Subprime invested in U.S. investments.
It evolved into a powerful machine that repackaged securities into U.S. mortgages and passed on - but also left risks to itself.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out.
“In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,” says bank expert Geiger.
How great is euphoria, how deep a fall.
One manager after the other had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a catapulting seat and to this day they are swinging.
Whoever runs a big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
He has to find a strategy for the bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: The end of investment banking, the focus on asset management, the return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is going to be declining, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he’s set to run UBS stores for a long time, the bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its status in the mid-1990s.
3,500 places cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But so far, he's only saying that he'll find his lady's apartment in Zurich first.
- Next year.
The fear of a recession in Europe weighs on the stock market in the United States.
The imminent recession in Europe has stripped U.S. investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.
The slump of industry production on the continent has suffocated in the womb of hope for the stabilization of the debt crisis.
General facilitation with the exchange of government in Rome and in Athens could not be implemented
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass last week was still deemed half full, not half empty - but now problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, the financial values stood on the sales notes.
The Dow-Jones Standard Values Index recorded a 0.6 percent drop at 12,078 points to end trading.
During trading, the market barometer stood between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

In September, the companies produced 2% less than in the previous month, according to the Eurostat statistical office.
"We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe is not recovering so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of weakness in banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC interview that it will probably not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
That is why it is probably too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the decades-old principle and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM has strengthened the stock exchange rate of the traditional group and left it against the trend during trading to first quote almost one percent higher.
The paper ended almost unchanged at $187.35.

Intelligent storms are spreading in cities
In many places, field owls are considered “problem birds”: however, these highly intelligent animals can not be expelled from cities long ago, experts say.
Some like them, others like to get rid of them quite quickly: The storms have been in the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities there are complaints of dirt and noise caused by animals.
There is not yet any means in the sight of "problem birds".
The Havrans of the field can no longer be expelled from the cities, said experts at the first symposium on the wells in the East African Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory were consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists have also deduced the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field oaks: The use of chemistry in agriculture is likely to destroy traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing build-up, and the fall of typical trees for nesting birds make life difficult.
The gates are protected.
A large colony with more than 600 nesting pairs is located in Westphalia, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project of mass killing of wretches in the rural district provoked negative headlines.
Critics have labelled the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing of calves as particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, fear, nothing," found the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or falling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are retreating, large colonies are splitting up and splitting into other places."
Scaring is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is conceivable to combine the expulsion of animals from sensitive habitats and their attraction to settle in other places.
In contrast, Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnologist, promoted the "information board instead of chain saws" because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One cancer in the face is finally best to stop with self-confidence."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Scientist's Curve Path in Schleswig-Holstein, where they provide information boards on the life of a highly intelligent field hawk.
In the meantime, the project is already accepted by tourists.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on the noise caused by the bird: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: the Havrans of the field not only use the aid to reach the beetle, but even make their tool as a tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested behavior on four ovals of the field, how far the intelligence of birds is reaching.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must lead to the destruction of the structure in order to get to the larvae of the mole.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the collapse of the platform.
In the second attempt, the lubricated boilers had to solve a more slippery problem.
In the vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a larvae.
The birds could not reach their prey with their teeth.
Researchers, however, put pieces of wire there.
From them all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which, as an inductor, she hunted a vessel for a holder from the tube.
Three of the four field marshes even managed to do so with an interception.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not go up.
Favourite Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the final tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made it perfect after 0:0 in the first match for the fifth time in a row at the European Championship.
In retaliation for the Czechs, the Play-off with the outsider Montenegro was enough to score 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was clear.
Croatia did not score a goal with 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland scored 1-1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored another goal for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional of the Federal League, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a penalty change (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) doubled for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already been disappointed in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a peaceful start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging the free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter later, Nani showed his quality in long-distance shooting and adjusted the 25-meter trefoil to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not finish in the first half, had their first clear chance in the goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
Former English player Wolfsburu, who led Manchester City, set the ball with a header on the lower margin of the March, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scoring for Czech Republic
In the end, there was referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After the action against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.)
On the opposite side, Stark carried out a controversial penal order after the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic with certainty changed.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Chairman clarified everything with four strokes.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion will leave for the fifth consecutive European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second already in the initial stage.
The goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech prevented the possible goalkeeper Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest chances when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the boundary of the criminal territory just around the Czech gate.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already-struck Czech World-Class goalkeeper, again reduced by the striker FC Seoul (50th).
Shortly before the end of the day, the door finally clarified everything.
At the time, Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed the score 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must almost certainly loosen his seat on the bench of the third at the 2002 World Cup, the Croats are allowed to rejoice from their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maximir Stadium, the Turks are expected to experience an almost fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only a stick in the seventh minute with a remote shot, and the striker Kazim could not hang the reflected ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia was taking over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not get the goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of the VfL Wolfsburg, who from the 62nd minute released the Dortmund Ivan Perisice, there were still legionnaires from the German League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who managed to score 4-0 in the first match already on a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute in the lead.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57.) equaled for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had a good first chance.
It was only at the last minute that the Estonian defense prevented the possible leader of the goal.
In the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After unsuccessful defending goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to a 1:0 position.

About 4,000 of SAP's more than 176,000 customers worldwide are booming in the country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers held around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the stores of a software manufacturer, which employs 55,000 people on a global scale, are running as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is, with the support of extensive research, to support sustainable growth in China.”
Massacre on a personal level
An emotionally powerful new book by Peter Englund titled Beauty and the Sorrow (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of protagonists as your head spins.
One tip on how to keep up at the moment: Carefully scrape this page and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know all the people very well in Mr. Englund's novel, and this list will serve as a navigation - like a beacon - at times when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite correctly, as an "antihistorical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it lacks almost ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, the author explains, but rather a "book about what it was like". It's mainly about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sadness" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy, or die.
Their lives fade like flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the web of destinies, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
It alters the notion that the First World War was only about terrible funeral battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sadness" also explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that bee nests fall on them, have to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or face the presence of tse-tse fly.
From the very beginning, it was a very touching reading.
War will devour people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling gunpowder.
When the shooting starts in the distance and you are the woman who is at home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually getting closer?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," Mr. Englund remarked, "was filled with riddles, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Sadness" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken entirely from biographies, letters and other materials already published. . . .
The descriptions of their lives may sound terrifying and compelling, but thanks to the incorporation of tiny moments and details they are absolutely alive and credible.
Many of them talk about spending and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Insignias, everywhere the same substitutes."
"Coffee stamp, imitation of aluminum, imitation of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes even further and describes the food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made of pressed rice cooked in scooped fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato shells, boots with wooden soles".
There were “837 registered substitutes for meat in the production of steams and 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds within himself an inner cradle of savagery and brutality, and declares of war: "Finally you will understand that this is human nature, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskeys."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon and no one will even notice it, let alone to grieve.
“When one finally settles for sacrifice, one would at least expect it to happen in front of the eyes of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict who he secretly hangs."
Other remarks relate to the departure of the old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition and a competitive struggle,” writes Mr Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an expressive and ideologically admirable mass murderer in tailor-made clothes, who performs his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, subjugation alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The greatest example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcus puss, which soldiers bought and tortured their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones even wiped it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is frizzy, but not in any way obvious, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which the war “dissolved completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about the First World War mostly rather than with a comprehensive narrative worked with clues, such as "World War I and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "On the Western Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional notion.
His book has the most overwhelming endings that have no period in popular scholarly literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
But you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled a page out of your hero list and burned it.
After the previous error this time for a minute exactly scheduled interval
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park was supposed to be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers. The others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, were not to be repeated, violating the rules of the department and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy spilled over to the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation, aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from the protesters, was started only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The chief executives were inspired by operations that took place in other cities.
Massive crisis behavior exercises took place in the Randalls Island area, which was preparing for an action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have intensified so-called riot repression training — counter-terrorism measures including the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers — with a focus on the lower Manhattan area.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute," someone said, to whom the event was originally explained only as an "exercise".
“I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and no one told them he was going to Zuccotti Park,” said the person who spoke only on condition that he remain anonymous.
"Only the top-ranked members of the department knew he was going to Zuccotti Park."
One reason for the secrecy was the lesson that the city had already received.
On October 14, city officials planned to clear the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they gathered hundreds of them before the start of the operation into the park.
On Tuesday, police officers from various units took part, including interception groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people come and go to the park during the day, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when as few people as possible will be in the park," he said.
Before the units took off, they lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks with arc lamps and amplifiers.
The light and the recorded message coming from the amplifiers scared many protesters.
When regulars entered the park in their blue windshields, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say they didn’t touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., so they wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack their things.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering on the edge of the park so they could enter the park if any arrests were to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police spokesperson Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers behaved rudely towards them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV cars on Church Street leading along the western border of the park could easily shoot.
The police marched westward and intertwined with a dense mess of protesters’ personal belongings, including luggage and bags full of clothes, after which teams from the sanitation department ran out, immediately collecting everything that was left in the park.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were pulled out of the park and documented footage appeared on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The most enigmatic group of protesters retreated near the kitchen in their camp, which was located near the center of the park.
Some have set up a blockade and the police have started their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people tied themselves to the tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of the emergency services were called in to cut the castles.
No arrests took place in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said in a statement.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of “organization of riots and resistance to arrest,” he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he was not involved in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case she needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, barriers were erected.
From these locations, the police developed a protective belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they push people even further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a demonstrator south of Pine Street was spotted jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others who blew the air out of the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of bricks flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of aid workers will sue the city for dismissal
Trade unions representing hundreds of school assistant workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They say that dismissal was not necessary and it was also discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools visited by poor students.
The judicial review is probably the last option left to the District Council 37 trade unions in their quest to reverse the dismissal decision.
On the 7th of October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the poorest paid employees of the city, lost their jobs to the help of the city. Their dismissal was described to the city by the union leaders as a retribution for the crying.
The city's officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissal was part of a budget approved in June.
One of the members of the council immediately objected to the fact that the budget did not specifically mention the dismissal of aid workers.
Representatives of District Council 37 announced they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him, calling a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit to the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight sacked workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the lawsuit, and therefore will not comment on the individual charges.
According to a complaint proposed by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of people released in the poor parts of the city, in order to support their claims of unjust conduct, because they were financially dissatisfied with the view that the poor came to schools.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island area did not leak at all and in the Upper East Side area only minimally, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs and in District 8 and 9, in the South Bronx, there were 46.
She recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five of the eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: "It's not a neighborhood full of moving parents who can provide the funds in compensation."
Public School 36’s budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates bonus funds for every reported poor student.
The unions argue, among other things, that the directors of secondary schools may have been confused by the way in which a document authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is more often used to describe the move of the teacher from the school payroll to the database of available workers whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," the complaint suggests, "and not just moved to the database on the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, the long-running dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of U.S. troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on a statement backed by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which the unanimity of the vote should "congratulate and congratulate the Libyans on their support."
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences mentioned may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy so far.
Over the summer, legislators on both sides have been constantly working with each other and the White House on the text of a series of declarations to approve or reject the United States’ military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House due to differences in views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the proposal was rejected in the House, the House also rejected measures to stop funding US operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purge – Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but apparently it didn’t bother his members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The weight of the congress eventually preceded other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the Commission on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable resilience in the effort to liberate their people" and "congratulates the professionalism of the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies."
The statement also “affirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be split in two halves again, as was the case with the June proposal?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the chief representative of the Republican Party in the commission, opposed the latest version.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
This week, the House will vote on an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, enforced by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first appendix to the Constitution relating to the budget or any other issue on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
The other legislators have not yet been able to push their proposals to the vote themselves, even through a considerable effort.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal put forward to the House and the Senate - and others are only minor changes by others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget supplement and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents—especially the novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation—can boast of their “authorship.”
The revenue on budget regulation, which was approved in August, required the House and the Senate to vote on the supplement on the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such a supplement.
In addition to the budget, a number of members also want to discuss limits on the number of terms that members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms that may serve as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a range of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The proposal remains a supplement prohibiting same-sex marriage and a supplement prohibiting the burning of the state flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in designing various supplements, they do not differ significantly from the average in comparison with previous years.
In the 111th Congress they offered 77 additions, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even fades compared to the early 90s of the 20th century, when, according to the statistics of the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment, which was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Crushed, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was shot by a gunman at a public meeting in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday evening to sing, along with the song "The Sun Will Come Out Tomor" to the Broadway show "The Sun Come Out Tomor."
Giffords appeared on the show "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that making sentences is still making her trouble and she needed help while walking.
The whole show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to a bullet wound that pierced her skull in front of her, penetrated the left half of her brain, and came out of her head from behind.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to take a triumphant part in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others injured, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang – describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Giffords, forty-one, said, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special of the show "20/20", which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The special monitored Gifford's entire recovery from the January 8 shooting.
The videos that Kelly shot during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more than just lift one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
Head sneezing.
Lip peeling.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show that the Giffords played a key role in the recovery of music: Congresswoman sings on them along with therapist on the melody to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that she remembers nothing from the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said Gifford had read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six were who was killed in the incident.
The shooting suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Atrocious, atrocious, atrocious."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point his wife declared during the recovery: "I lost."
"So I told her right away: Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly said.
"You just got a loader.
But you can do it, get yourself together, and come back even stronger than ever.”
Military forces meet with compassion rather than with respect. . . .
The event was a gala evening on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines ran around him.
The festively dressed crowd stood up and cheered enthusiastically.
"The men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
In addition to Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military forces a little differently, the then chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff attended the festive evening.
"They were all portrayed as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers thought that well.
I know you did.
But what I saw was not respect, it was regret.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the army and the often dissatisfied, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is immeasurably included with praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public increasingly behaves as if the individual in uniform regrets.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way some people can support us is to put us in the role of unfortunate souls.”
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops returning from Vietnam had been much worse.
As a result, most words of remorse are spoken in silence and privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat, where they served as members of the navy, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles.
From the point of view of some will feel respect and astonishment because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will be stabbed if "under the surface there is no evil, violent veteran," said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and after his return took a place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him implicitly suggested whether he could withstand the stress associated with working in Washington as soon as he returned to the fighting.
“When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions,” Cancian taught his sons.
The military’s concern stems in part from American indifference to wars.
Successes on the battlefield rarely reap recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and has little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer respect military heroism as usual during World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses primarily on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of events they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to take a hard stand against rape.
This week, it will decide whether to start a trial of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the rape case.
If not, they are ready to file a lawsuit with hundreds of other applicants.
Elizabeth Lyman, a first-class soldier, was reportedly raped by her military colleague for 25 years and was in her 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the barracks at the Miramar airbase north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, so they could have a drink in her room.
"There was a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texasan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I could listen to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her in bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the military will wait for a verdict in a hearing that could have a historic impact. It will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will go into it about whether the charges against him and his predecessor, Roberts, and the former defense minister.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charge was filed in February by Washington attorney Susan Burke, and the complaining party had 17 members at the time. However, in the following months their number increased to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claimed to have been raped by the arsonists, all of whom claimed to have been raped by the arsonists, and all of whom were sexually assaulted by the arsonists.
Burke says she's going after the highest-ranking army commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The military is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to implement measures against such acts? Supreme Command."
Burke has also claimed to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of further lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - putting all the eggs into one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in several different cases, if necessary, so that the pressure does not ease.
The defense team is led by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, filed a motion to reject the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek discuss in detail the strategy of defense—in principle, current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries they have suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document said.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is all about wording: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clearly defined frontline.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
The time has come for modernization to take place in the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and besides her, she's got three other lawyers dealing with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for supposedly developing an atmosphere that encourages hatred of women.
Independently, the non-profit organization Service of American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for its lawsuit against the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personality violations", which was allegedly identified by the bprosto's group on the victims of rape, and by the bprosto's group on the victims of the violence.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against a state-run organization for dealing with veterans, which she accuses of discriminatory practices that were supposed to occur when processing requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties and proposed a number of remedial measures in them.
According to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report, issued in March, also analyses the rate of criminal prosecution of suspects: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army were brought to court - half against the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in Burke's case describe the attacks as the first in a series of traumas.
For example, a first-class soldier Lyman reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to various police members, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape and in her bed was found the blood of the attacker - from the wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing, during which she was asked whether she was in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned to testify in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was handed down,” Lyman says.
"I felt like I was giving birth right there on the spot - with a scream I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'It wasn't his trial. It was mine.'"
The Lymans ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her ineligible to serve.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to service.
Whether Lyman and the other prosecutors’ case moves to the next stage or not, it’s a long-running run, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to the next stages of the negotiation."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the doctrine mentioned, which has been criticized from the first moment the light of the world has seen.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because their duties do not allow them to observe the same rate of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevo<0xC3><0xA1>, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people ready to file a lawsuit and start working on other cases related to the matter.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, from where there will be no reform," he said.
Or until we die, depending on what comes sooner.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Research You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July homicidal homicide, after which 77 people died in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer while preparing the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing group on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting them isn’t really that hard at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the UK’s research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so vast, says Bartlett, that scientists have had enough to simply use ads on the site and thus accurately identify the search demographic — something marketing staff have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, paying attention to them and sending them advertisements, but instead of inviting them to their own groups through them, they invited them to their own groups or offered them to their own groups, they invited them to their dietary products.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans from 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without having to leave the office at all.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not that surprising: online right-wing groups are all-young men who are pounding the rising rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends that hide behind state updates, wall posts, and the "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them will provide three different data per day, making this social network literally an “information supernova” that is behind the development of many new research studies. The number of academic papers in which Facebook has become a name has increased by 80 percent.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
“It used to be that when you wanted to conduct a survey of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to get to the side where you’d never be let go,” says Bartlett.
“Facebook is breaking all of this down – you’re just going straight to them.”
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify a socio-health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Morenova of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drinking outcomes on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent on the topic.
Morenov<0xC3><0xA1> suggests that peers of students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of the paper, Dr. Morena and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
“We’ve found a way to identify endangered children that we wouldn’t otherwise have a chance to discover.”
Facebook is constantly surveying the data of its users.
The information team of the website developed statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day relationship, the participation in the elections in 2010 and the satisfaction coefficient of the nation (mainly using the information to which they had access to the information - the access to information after the internet freedom was obtained).
But Facebook users know that the page is being watched, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the option to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the page needs to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline, but online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most of the users even thought that scientists could look at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students’ public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it so that the information was only between them and their friends."
It is then also necessary to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching offline there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
It is not possible to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that pencils and notebooks remain the best possible tool to use in research.
“When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
“Social research should be about society and social activities – and a lot of social activities are still going on offline,” he said.
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public court hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a “fighter of resistance” during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Templar knights," he said before the court where 500 people gathered.
"I raise an objection to the court because you have been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I confess no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought the prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for four months, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he was held firmly under lock.
All of them took part in the process to move the case to an early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told a NRK commentator.
“It wasn’t pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved a little further.”
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When entering and leaving the building without difficulty to see the present journalists and survivors in the eye.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of the larger "resistance" movement, the judge found him not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
For some, it may be comforting that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish she would fall out like a creature, but that's not the case," said one of the victims' relatives.
"If it were, everything would be much easier."
7 Lessons from a Lost Interview with Steve Jobs in This Week’s Movie
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge — and chose him as his genius Most Modern Inventor.
At a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs, which was provided for a special film that goes to cinemas this week, it will be for all Apple fans the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but at the same time also a pedantic organizer and a man who fits every detail into the smallest detail - he believed that a lot of entrepreneurs in the industry are suffering from the "experience of a product."
In 1995, Bob Cringley was working on the TV show Triumph of Computer Madness, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than hourly interview took place.
By this time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands with his new computer company NeXT, and was looking impatiently at how the broad public would accept the internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's entire interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were rumored to have been lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly trimmed, forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which takes place in selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has been known for their distaste for providing longer interviews, here Jobs seems to be surprisingly excited to be able to talk about their technology philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, it happens that there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how Jobs' answer perfectly reflects on it to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism emerges on the surface, when Cringely’s questions seem impatient and prompt him to get to the more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and reveals horrifyingly prophetic ideas as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing well and wrong, while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the posthumous assessment of Job’s career, but on Job, who we see here as a passionate dreamer in the blossom of his genius, there is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It wasn’t long before, and after he had expressed his thoughts, he began to put them into practice as well.
A quick summary of seven scenes from The Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned how to run a business:
“During the years of business, I’ve always asked myself, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer was always the same, ‘Well, that’s just how it’s done.’”
No one knows why they are doing what they are doing, they never think deeply about business-related things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the inscription "standard costs", he could only think of their amount. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs.
How he performed the Rosary on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the “Blue Box” he built with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
There has been a lot of writing about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a power tool is literally contagious.
It tells how Wozniak tested the devices using a paid phone and allowed them to switch from one AT&T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least a half-dozen times we've been around the world like this, so when we yelled into a paid phone, it was a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
“When we were young, we found that we were able to build something on our own that could manage billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us made a little thing that was able to control a much bigger picture – it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have come into existence without it.
Jobs continues by describing the joke, which Wozniak and I had almost reached the end of. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, pretending to be Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called up to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they even called the Pope himself, the couple cheered and put their headset down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12, and he scanned the spare parts to build the mileage, he found Bill Hewlett's number on the phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company really is and how it should behave towards its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit a company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager at HP, I progressed higher and higher, flipped around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How Innovation Invents:
In a few places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he invents new products on the run.
At the beginning of his career, when he went out to sell a couple of PCBs, one customer asked him to assemble an entire computer for him.
He had only 30 days paid to invent, disassemble and supply the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalled the problems they faced in the development of computer mice:
"I remember how we were fighting wildly... yelling at me that it would take five years [to put a mouse that would cost $300] until I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies get their breath:
Long before he led the revival of Apple, Jobs predicts that many industry leaders in his vision will slumber and lose their share of the market.
“Let’s say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you’re making better copies or printers, so what’s next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At this point, sales and marketing are already under control, so companies are led by people who are in charge of this, while people who are in charge of their own products are evicted from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has brought the company to its intrepid position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox was able to literally own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she was, she could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
Instead of winning, they earned a loss.
How to take innovation as a form of art:
“Between a great idea and a great result, there is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and as that great idea develops, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to come up with a whole range of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories will not make you do.
You have to keep in mind 5000 things all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
Ultimately, it depends on your taste – you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been embarrassed to let the best ideas go.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful that the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and at the same time the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was dealt with by a court.
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, will be present at the hearing.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges came together to discuss the proposals put forward.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care that Congress passed last year — a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the result of which will further develop the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who stands before the court and will try to achieve a rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been engaged in defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which huge funds are at stake.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
What about a guest appearance? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: These two judges have been taking part in the events of the Federalist Society group for years.
And it is certainly not a matter of anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
If this were not the case, however, their conduct would definitely fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in events that are being held by the related and other organizations in order to obtain funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor a programmer."
Nevertheless, Scalia’s and Thomas’ relationship with the two law firms operating in the case, and also with a huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
“This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is inconsistent with several judges’ claim that the Supreme Court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and had dinner for the social benefit along with the lawyers who were waiting for their case to be heard before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the feet of all claims of inattention, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics and told them that they too easily combine their judicial obligations with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a high-profile conservative activist.
Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem lies mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General under President Obama’s government when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Kagan's critics are pushing her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought for the law at the time so much that she could now be uninvolved.
Kagan did not indicate that she was about to resign.
Boeing acquires record-breaking order for US$18 billion in jet aircraft
Emirates Airlines is ordering 50 twin-engine jets of Boeing 777 with the option of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it is something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing has announced its biggest order in its history for the dollar value of commercial jets - 50 twin-engine Boeing 777s.
The Sensational Order came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines will be able to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would increase the total order value to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes referred to as the Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
This means that they not only have money to pay for airplanes, but the rise in fuel prices — mostly damaging airlines because they are one of their biggest costs — is not so decisive, as the country itself makes profits at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to rising fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The order from Emirates Airlines strengthens Boeing’s leadership position in the wide-body aircraft market and introduces Airbus SAS, which has sought to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after representatives of Airbus announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER, will be postponed.
This was due to the fact that customers demanded a larger payload of the aircraft and flight, so the manufacturer took the time to supply the machine with more engine power.
The share price of Boeing Co. increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister is reportedly defeated in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was assisted in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
It appears that Felipe Calderona's sister lost in the violent state elections for the governorship of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n. On Monday, she subsequently declared that one of her opponents was helped by drug smugglers to win.
Preliminary results have been attributed to the leadership in the governorial elections of the western state to Faust Vallejo by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the members of the organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially then until yesterday's election itself, is alarming not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole of our country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... They seized the polling booths, they built roadblocks... and they let people vote on the order for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, he plans to return to power early, and the victory in the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have defeated Calderon, who led the day before the election, only very closely.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has so far controlled the governing body. For the disputed and sadly persecuted party, before the 2012 presidential election, it is a very unfortunate defeat.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and invites other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the birthplace of President Calderon, and it was in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n that in December 2006 the military began the fight against smugglers.
However, the violence continued.
The PAN mayor, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates resigned from the election out of fear.
However, no matter what the results of the Michoacan elections look like for the PRI party, winning the party will help to gain a new impetus.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallejo and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB Bank Calls on Asia to Help Save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must “do everything in their power” to help the currency bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund, or through direct talks.
He warned that the BRIC countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all of Europe’s troubles “too undisturbed” and said that Asian financial aid combined with European leadership and funds will help to rekindle the long-term collapse of the economy.
"We're all in it together."
"So anyone who could help Europe from the crisis is right," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is certainly not immune."
“So if China and India can help, they definitely should do it.”
For several months now, the European Monetary Union has been subjected to a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy could rebound into a recession, and calls have started to emerge for emerging economies to come together and help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Institution - would provide greater opportunities for Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said India will “do what it can” to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying-out of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a naked fact, because how else could we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to 1.2 billion people in India, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
“One day they might find that the Greeks are retired in their fifties and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain,” he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is under threat of a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 is now facing a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to create “plans of unpredictable spending” to protect them from the decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Possible Reductions in Defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress put the boiler under the hood, warning that sweeping automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefields in Afghanistan’s Linz-Afghanistan.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next ten years, but it is now worried about another $600 billion in cuts if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress’s inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called suspension would cause 23% of the pause to fall and many new projects to stop.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this unreasonable way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can not buy only three-quarters of buildings or ships. In addition, there could be serious damage."
“We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements.”
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts will also affect combat troops, Panetta announced.
“Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected by this stoppage, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets,” Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The state of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
The two senators fired Panett ten days ago and asked him for details about possible impacts on automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a stay at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this tough measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign it."
“The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow.”
“It will only be seen if Panett’s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the Pentagon to be excluded from the list of cut-off areas.
Panetta was more and more open lately in talks about possible cuts, although he himself moved to his senior position in the Pentagon with many years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going to the desert.
At a press conference a minute a week, the defense minister indicated a brief picture of what his resort can expect - the shell of the army, but inside of which the nucleus will be missing.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of a speech at the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed..."
In the annex, delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, he specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations on the possibilities of deployments and deployments around the world; presumed unacceptable risks of future operations."
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could wait for completion, including those that are already being tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, a project of the F35, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle, with which the army and navy wanted to replace the humvee.
By stopping further development and testing of the F35 aircraft, it would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is necessary for the country to cope with further threats and threats from China.
How to Recognize a Lie
A fleeting look at recent newspaper headlines tells how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential nominee Herman Cain has a full-time job accusing him of sexually harassed several women — both sides say the other is lying.
Managers at Penn State University were accused of misconduct when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama with a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy entire careers and undermine the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately refuted by undeniable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of abusing finances from his campaign to try to hide his non-marriage.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that rallied around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinska.
It's all about cheating at school and at the university.
There are cases when teachers give their students test answers themselves, just to make them look good in their judgements.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending out a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many frauds do we face?
Studies show that in a single day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let’s assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers bludgeoned three times in their lives during the first ten minutes of the first meeting.
Determining lies, or “recognizing lies,” is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, to the <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC3><0xA1>da, when one shouts, "I have you." The recognition of deception is a serious branch of science working with the scientific data of the philosophies collected by the philosophies of the sub-projects collected during the past six decades.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're sniffing, sniffing, blushing, or embroidering.
Of course, do not deduce from the fact that it is somehow difficult for liars to notice and uncover.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the sentence structure, the small expressions on the face, the way questions are formed and their timing.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a vast and developing field of the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the discovery of lies is a modern skill, which can be easily learned after your work, and can be useful to you in today's complex world.
Good liars are able to read well in others, let them sink into alertness, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men carry more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect one's feelings - that married people lie less often than their partners.
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, look at the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "initial observation."
Thanks to it, he will have a later finding of what to compare with.
Notice the holding of the body of the subject, his laughter, working with the voice.
You should know if someone is constantly kicking their feet so that you don’t falsely accuse them of lying just because they start kicking their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the sums of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
However, consider it only as a warning sign, not as a proof of a lie.
People carrying a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their fictional story, they can turn the tip of the boots to the door, lean towards the east, change the posture of the body significantly, or expose them to a "slip-off" after the interview.
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is at the end, just to see what relief will look like after it’s finished.
Also understand the subject’s language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once spoke and used the past time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which sparked a nationwide search for her body.
The fraudulent individuals can also express themselves in an apt way: “I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinska” or they repeat the difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal characters are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "smoothing language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... from my best mind."
In such an answer, we do not know too many facts and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills by which a lie can be traced.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a greater chance of not encountering a liar and a fraudster in his personal and professional life.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delay of approval by the U.S. government appeared
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which was respected by trade unions but reassured the environmentalists - the company was reluctant to give the project a heads-up, announcing that it had been relocated.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will relocate the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada’s Alex Pourbax says the company is convinced that eventually pipeline construction will be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
The announcement came after the foreign ministry announced last week that it is delaying a decision on the federal approval of the project, from which it will not carry out a study of possible alternative routes, which would be possible not to interfere with the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the watershed Og.
"This is really a move forward," Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, that is, a year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to play any political role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request by the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flows daily.
Six states will have to cross this route.
This project is completely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by labor groups who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created when working on pipelines.
However, lawmakers in Nebraska opposed the plan and were considering enacting laws that would force the company not to interfere in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala water layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the environmental impact, commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, found that the project will have only a small negative ecological impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the inspector general from the Ministry ordered a new review of the study and a thorough review of the whole process.
Once upon a time, the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, was not present in the program of conflict of interest.
Another, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of giving up her toddler’s fears
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously broke into the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter out of fear.
The release of the hit singer "Lady Marmalade" scared eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family claims in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk landed the car, Roseanna Monk gathered her luggage down the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard and took Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said that she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "You know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I left to pick her up. "
LaBelle punished a pregnant woman with irritation.
"In an aggressive tone she told me, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, 'I don't care about your opinion.'"
She became angry and began to speak rudely—she shouted out loud the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started waiting for water from it.
He claims Genevieve had a hysterical attack.
“I said to the woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’ ” the mother said to the child.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother—who still had Genevieve in her arms—and had to stop her until her companion, who then dragged her into the waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The girl, meanwhile, cried so much when she turned around, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter apologizing to LaBelle, but they did not receive any answers.
Lawyer and singer LaBelle are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the whole case.
The lawsuit calls for a more unspecified damages but family lawyer, Sam Davis, said the case was taken for free and that the family plans to allocate the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
“The goal is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions,” Davis said.
“Such behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child.”
Climate change slows down the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and with them the economy
The year 2011 will be inscribed in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress in terms of the slump of the economy, however, the slump of the slump of the years to the disadvantage of the climatic conditions.
The low temperatures in February caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the opportunities for growth of the state economy, have a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of this year. In the agricultural sector, the dynamics of the sector also decreased by 31.16%.
According to the report of the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed, and the remaining 21.07% were found to be flattened.
The decline in economic activity in the first half of the year led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state.9% in the first half of the year.In the second half, the rate of unemployment in the state was increased.In the first three quarters, there was an increase in economic activity in the second half.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment related to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of the legislation, which the Congress has tried to pass, or those who do not have the power to do so in connection with the fight against the laundering of dirty money.
Stopping the migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said that the demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who go to work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the inconvenience of entry and then also because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. So the people stay in the state and do not ask for work from us."
Unreliability
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing insecurity that predominates in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Democracy 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without deducting social security benefits.
Unemployment and unreliability are added to other features of the labour market, such as low wages. In this administrative territory, the lowest wages are from across the country, as stated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa State was 5,352 pesetas as of September, well below the national average, which amounts to 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of Foreign Direct Investments
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was also the most significant decrease in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance in the period from January to June, the foreign direct investment amounted to an increase of 1430 697 dollars.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government lists investments in the amount of 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were directed mainly to enterprises in the field of services.
Dluh
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state in July asked the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revitalize the economy. The local congress did not approve a loan of 2 million pesos.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés pointed to a lack of management skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of coordination of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really small during this year. We have to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012, we have to do double the efforts, we will do the work, we will do the harmonization of the efforts of all of us, and in particular, we will have to do so in 2012."
Slowness of the economy
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that the events like the cold at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, among other things frost. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to re-establish the dynamics of the service, which would allow the service to be sub-contracted, and the product to achieve an acceptable level of movement.
Re-defining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employers Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we observe that it is working. We believe that it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan, which would redefine the goals and economic direction of the state, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources," he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said that the current administration had shown progress in the conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be polite. I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced to 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for a criminal act of threatening health, specifically for keeping marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by members of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 at a funeral in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was in a pick-up truck of white color. In the car in the shelf had a black bag and on the passenger seat a small backpack. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man has remained available to the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Effects of Criminal Offences.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk of not being reached to the end or of having major delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda said.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that if the construction work has so far gone ahead, now the government of the state will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require funds in the amount of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Up to this time, the funds for work have been supplied only by the Federation and the city, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of the projects.
"They have to secure almost 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we didn't get anything at all. And even though in July we had to get a part," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started and projects continue very frankly", but it is missing.
He said that last year, under the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant deliveries, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million that the state administration did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the aforementioned programs this year, we had to get funds that would cover what the state did not finish."
Despite the fact that there is a promise on the part of state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the secretary of administration and finance, to speed up the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
“We were supposed to get 12 million dollars, and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven’t even gotten a peso yet.”
Court approves ‘end of analogue broadcasting’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) has rejected a constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which seeks to speed up the so-called "disabling of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of in 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree setting out the individual steps that will lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the appeal filed by the Senate was rejected because a qualified majority of eight votes was not obtained, which was necessary for the court to express the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero proposes the possibility to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter that is reserved according to the law to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The Ministers’ meeting also decided to reject the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies without engaging in a discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify himself with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards measures for the preparation of public administration.
“I don’t think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that deferring change would defer the benefits of digitalisation, which requires decisions in the public interest, because digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but also "affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He said it was not possible for the government to introduce into the administrative area compliance with laws prepared by the legislature by issuing a dissenting decree, which to some extent interferes with the jurisdiction of the Congress.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n analyzes the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, 879 votes out of 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" appeared in this year's Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent, and that's not yet the case.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Authority approved a number of measures to harmonize local reform norms with the federal electoral system.
As will still be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n <0xC3><0x81>povetn<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>ov<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE>upan<0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislatures and declared the head of state’s vote on constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” because it has no right to “neither approve nor veto.”
On the question of the possibility of counting "voice by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal replied that the adoption of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM would make it possible for the local electoral authority to carry out both partial and total counting.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more ballots, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation of the votes in the relevant box or the votes of the polls are not available by the President; or if the President has not yet made it available from the polls; or
In addition, the total count of votes in all elections will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point in the second round of the candidate; whenever the party does not appear at the beginning of the session.
The total number of votes may also be calculated if, after a proper count, it is found that the difference between the probable winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also if there is an explicit request from the political party to the second place, the second place, the second place.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His Last Will <0xE2><0x86><0x92>

The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, a ceremonial ceremony and a backbone Mass will take place.
According to the family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, where the family and close friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant’s ashes reached the chapel of Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell was held at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, organized by his former high school tech classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinama Mountains. That's how he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant-colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age and attended the flight school Colegio del Aire in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, yet he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he barely came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked most in life: flying.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, the deputy colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honours that came to him to surrender the governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the citizens and the government of the state, the military of Mexico, the military of the school, through the Tecalite in the Tequila in the sixth military zone, in the front of the Mexican uprising.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days after a helicopter crashed, and the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all of the state's officials, were also on board.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltillan cousin Bacio Cortés arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force through the funeral service under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez on the premises, where the next son-in-law, his mother, son-in-law, and son-in-law, Crist<0xC3><0xB3>n and daughter Amanda, gathered together.
Three dead bodies were found on the ship Cadereyta NL
Several hours before the find, military officials presented to the media 11 people who had been detained in the area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting into different parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned estate of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place on the 1.5-kilometer road from Cadereyt to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the body of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the men wore a sports shirt in yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not shoes. Next to him was also a man in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three were lying face-to-face towards the ground.
According to data obtained at the sites, all three people were likely killed elsewhere because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime the other and also a number of traces on the bullets, both on the construction and on the door.
11 suspects were arrested in Cadereyt
The National Defense Secretariat represented 11 people, including young people, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyt area and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to published information, during the first attempt on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony, eight people were detained and one person was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and they confirmed they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
On November 12, at 6 a.m., the military personnel were at a rally in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyt, when they spotted cars without an SSP and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they made an inspection and discovered one rifle, a ammunition and 18 ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the complices in the La Frauda area was arrested on 13 November at about 2 p.m. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burials in the villages of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that will keep the country above the ruins of economic disasters.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that keeps the country above the brink of economic disaster and that has endangered the entire eurozone.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well-marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, i.e. in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has caused the debt to rise to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve a tough package of austerity measures demanded by European leaders, only to restore Italy's broken credibility.
Due to the volatility of the markets, the interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity exceeded the 7% threshold, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, the president of the Italian employers’ organisation Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Montim: “We said we would be very supportive of this government.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this fiery situation.
Monti’s hopes for success have increased significantly thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, who was forced to resign from the crisis on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are predestined for good results,” said Angelina Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because up until this point a number of its members have opposed the government with a technocratic majority composed of Monti.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong support from parliament in order to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any impediment or delay in the effort in question could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has added to the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti began talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by President Neapolitan on Sunday, who allowed a very rapid process in response to the crisis.
After a brief fall at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, interest on Italian bonds has returned to a critical boundary, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will reap success.
Saving Italy, which has a public debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion, would be beyond the possibilities of the eurozone's current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should hold on to power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, despite general prognoses that politicians only give him time to carry out reforms, and then announce early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politics in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be made up of only experts in order to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has come into because of financial pressure.
Political sources said that bilateral mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate an attempt to include political figures in the government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, 10 will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 allowed players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on Costa Rica’s side, when we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe champions, FIFA’s number one monthly rating, have a wide range of inter-league Class A matches on their account, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to have played 50 international matches.
He reached that number last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Stars and in the strong clubs of the English First League, maintain intense activity in league championships and domestic cups over the course of a year and in high-level matches within European cups such as the Champions League.
To the previous one, we must also add the experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated knockout matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is Concacaf here, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the biggest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has on their account goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches last Saturday against England (loss 0-1 in London).
Casillas will also play against Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even last week officially announced to UEFA along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account, among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and midfielder Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close to 100 with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and near Michael Umana, the left wing J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az moves with 48 matches and the goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 crossed the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's best shooter is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most interventions, nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
“The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality”
In an exclusive interview for Viva, Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself ensures that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That’s what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of the tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence and on Sunday 20th will be at a unique stop in Central America.
The day will start at 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium along with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n website.
For your Costa Rican fans it is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes a reality.
In South and Central America we are barely the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, and it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're so excited to be able to bring you our music.
I wonder, because here they literally love the group, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your biggest fans?
Thank you for having been with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people already call the concert the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve performed in the last 21 years have been created over the course of a few weeks.
We presented a few great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope that this will get us in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. So we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played here, we have no restrictions that we could not do.
We will try to perform the best show with a variety of tracks. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat a repertoire.
- Why?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs we’re going to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we’ve probably forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
With this tour you will celebrate 20 years of the art track.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've been able to do?
Yes, I do.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd stay in it for more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and it makes us feel that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love to make music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten any better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group in which the giants themselves are represented.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising that when a movement arises from a group of friends, too often it does not happen.
From time to time, a group arises in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to rise from one city at a time.
We are proud of it and are proud to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we are all lucky that we are still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have been able to open up musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we respect each other’s music, and I don’t think it could be any better.
Your relationship with the word of fame has not been easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually becoming easier to find a balance.
We try not to ride too much on the tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You must not let yourself be kidnapped by being famous, rock stars. None of us ever really cared about this.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at the beginning it was a great thing.
As a band, we have been in existence for three years and we never released any albums until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in a band with us. If I don't listen to a song or have to listen to it, I'll take a look at it.
She was an incredible person and we miss her very much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as predators?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious about what Las Robertas have to offer live and they have to be very fun.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
The first to attack me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all night about the bassists that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt a slight separation from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I imagine the bands that I mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the others that were created at the same time. And if this kind of music is still valid today, it's a great thing for him, because it's a lot like him.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly cloudy character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that the new album has a few songs that are lighter-than-heavy, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered to be very obscure, although they may sound like positive.
At both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and the songs are deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and that's what these two songs represent to me.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still make lavish music.
Peru:
Fujimori has been hospitalized again due to medical tests.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss he suffers in the lower limbs, his attending physician reported.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has caused him to have surgery four times and is now under the control of doctors.
MEP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could get mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He had surgery four times because of cancer of the tongue, dropped 18 kilograms and added to these problems were other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, cysts on the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murder squad of illegally operating troops in the first years of his government.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin their visit to Mexico on Tuesday, aiming to expand trade between the two nations and touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet on Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n. This is the most important meeting of a comprehensive visit full of meetings with representatives of politics, commerce and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was announced by the Uruguayan Presidential Council.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said in a statement on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries, which will continue to hold on to the position of tax havens, would be excluded from the international community, this statement prompted a rejection by Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world’s most powerful developing and developed countries. The Latin American country has signed an information exchange agreement since January this year to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to make fiscal exchange agreements concrete in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s "black charter", to which countries have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
"Super Mario 3D Land" is now available in 3D.
Super Mario has been fighting relentlessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser's villain, but has never yet appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming this month to all stores around the world, has been created from the start to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to wear glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell you how to use stereoscopy without glasses," Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a Nintendo specialist in Spain, told a video game show in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this medium", because up to this point successful shots such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to being a 3D image, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", the task of which is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can jump into the "second round" on levels of games that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and "not subject to optical deceptions".
This new Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays into the note to those who follow the arrow and repeats the successful formula from the previous parts. It is that the bearded man's installer will have to go through dangerous mined platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the moves, in the surroundings, in disguises, and also among enemies, Luigi will also appear "playing" Luigi.
Colom approves the release of Portilla to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had stepped down on the issue of ex-President Alfonso Portilla, who is to be held accountable for the conspiracy to launder $70 million in the United States.
This is the end of the process, the aim of which was for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that requested the issuance of Portilla in order to be able to prosecute it.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and executive power and that he recalled that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his term of office he did not "interfere" with court decisions and allowed all the releases he received on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be extradited for murder and serious harm to health, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's step means a step in execution after all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to lead the trial against the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the matter of smuggling $120 million at the Department of Defense during his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Department of Public Affairs withdrew and thus brought the case back into play.
Trinijov helped 6,000 young people in danger
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they do not fall on the edge of society.
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of the existence of the social support organization Trinijove is very important: 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion have been helped. The organization for 25 years helps them to overcome difficult situations.
This must be attributed to the long hundreds of jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to present the balance sheet within the framework of the festive event, which took place in the former production facilities of the Fabra i Coats factory and attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijova was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, without work, with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organizations and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years took part in the meeting yesterday in Sant Andreu.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniformity of the work carried out by Trinijova.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist mayor Ricard Goma.
The Fabra and Coats Hall was also attended by Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, and Jaume Lanaspa, the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa.
Mas said that Trinius was born in a very difficult time and that the present time also provides a number of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation".
The president cited Trinijov as an example of how it is possible to fight adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is not new for this organization and for the work it does, it is nothing new,” he said.
There was a relocation of the seized house, in which gigantic parties were held
Intruders seized 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without protesting
All evidence suggests that the nightmare that the neighbors of number 51 on Balmes Street have been through is finally over.
Twelve people left the building at noon yesterday voluntarily, where they lived illegally, and where they organized gigantic parties that woke the neighbors, leaving the building by court order and without having to interfere with the police.
At the end of the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the manager said.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind all kinds of waste, especially cans after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque emphasizes that the occupants of the building made it unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the discotheque costs 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to complaints from neighbors about noise. However, the problems were not caused by the visitors of the discotheques, but by the residents of the rented house and especially those who attended the festivities held here.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she has been forgiving her rent.
The city police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbours over the past few weeks about the situation.
Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, the chairman of the city group of the PP People's Party at the town hall, last week called for "the building to be immediately evacuated and thus end with the problems of civil coexistence suffered by the neighbours and with the destruction of the area".
The president of the people explained that only one floor was taken last summer, but in recent months, the occupants got to all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civil liability that occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 p.m., police arrived at building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four of them were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of filing a procedure, which carries with it more than controversy about fees
The city’s 16-gate selection process opens the debate on the role of the Collserola park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the greatest flourishing of the Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the disappearance of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the wildlings instead of the Yogi bear.
That was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 competitors for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, captures the park’s ideas.
Either this one, or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and based on reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It’s already a theme that’s as frivolous as when two members of this old caste, chosen at a meeting in the elevator, give each other their hand.
And it was this act that sparked one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects and the more prominent university professors think.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure has its reasons.
According to Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after the question was raised by the Gulf side, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side" as well, so Ildefonso Cerd's speech on green apples was not questioned until the end.
“We have to take the principle that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gate to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a delimitation of zones where it is possible to act".
The module, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifies design as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some danger".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty presently represented by the project of the public place" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the area of the Forum "its lavish singing".
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
“To define something is to take the next step already,” that is, in principle, to move one step further.
“We need to keep in mind the new urban planning and planning tools, because the current ones (referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster.”
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be considered a park, but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "could not end up in the garbage", although he welcomes the fact that the mayor offers his grammar to intervene in the project from the "first moment".
And in addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "doubts" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills").
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because in the documents for the selection process there is a lack of the global vision of Collserola: "16 selection procedures have been announced, which would have dealt with the whole axis of the mountain, but not with the study of the sea."
As a result, at least he has signed up for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of a single gate may clash with the concept and definition of the architect of a neighboring gate.
In his view, the city council should ensure that the area located directly above the Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the zone of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino apologised to Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal, who will be released
After 72 days incarceration, Cadino Red granted a pardon to Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the Casino Red legislature granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court in the district concerned, which was discussing a case of extortion in which he was accused of the mayor's brother Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask him to pay an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Hall to operate illegally in a betting house.
After a public indictment, the State Prosecutor’s Office initiated a criminal prosecution of the Panistic mayor’s brother. On September 2, he was arrested and jailed for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the State Department Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison No. 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the state capital.
He remained at this location for the next 49 days after the second imprisonment order was passed and the Public Prosecutor’s agent denied the possibility of co-participation or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyt Criminal Court on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casina Red for a sum of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderately severe surveillance because he was threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to stay in city cells in San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was given an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been collected to allow a 1,5-pronged opera to prove Jonas's guilt.
On Monday, Casina Red’s legal representative, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, delivered the case to Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for a pardon for his brother, the mayor of the region.
During the legal hearing with the representative of the Public Prosecutor’s Office assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damages were repaired and which of the companions decided to grant the pardon. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain silent.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal favour is granted to Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal. In the proceedings against him, it will not be possible to file a complaint. It is also not possible to seek compensation for damages or punishment.
After a hearing with the legal officer at about 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanéz, went to the prison in the city of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and that his case was postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come presented details of the plane crash in which the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people died.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident in which Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died show that the helicopter hit the ground directly with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, the secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the plane started, the pilot noted that climatic conditions allow flights.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings got entangled in a branch of trees 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the corpse."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, it stated that, based on the investigation carried out in the area of the collision, no components were found on the ground.
"The search found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft ran into the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all the requirements for the transportation of people.
The terrain exhibits a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is most important to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the collision, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at travel speed and there was an accident on soft ascent terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a common overflight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come named six key investigative points:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aeronautical standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate start conditions, in accordance with which the aircraft is proceeding towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the cloudy crew they were looking for a lower area and greater visibility all the way to the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the collision.
Coordinates of the collision and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that before the collision there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of the remnants of the aircraft in a restricted territory:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the collision occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The pattern of the dispersal of the aircraft's remains indicates that the helicopter was intact at the time of the impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident that would indicate an explosion or a fire had occurred.
The latest results of the investigation show that several contacts with the mainland may have occurred.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is tilted, the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the footage where there is likely to be a breakdown along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, no helicopter remains were found in an area larger than the landing site, which reinforces the presumption that the collision occurred in a state when the helicopter was still intact.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance Launches Gene Research That Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to discover a gene that causes obesity in children and adolescents. The research called "The Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescents" will allow you to get results related to obesity.
In a report, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Center of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Participation in the research can also be made by the general public, with or without permission. People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will take youth tests from 8 a.m. each meeting.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and as of October 8, this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Center (Eastern Mexico State).
Once data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and significance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity, and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on age.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He clarified that every Saturday all participants were subjected to anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure was measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels were determined and the genes were examined (trying to identify genes).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said the research reflects health care workers’ concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was a 77% increase in obesity in boys and 47% in girls, and a dramatic increase in overweight," the IMSS expert said.
He noted that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations in their genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and obesity.
He explained that in general the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calorie) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they are given an overall assessment of the condition of the children, which determines whether they have any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
The information is confidential so far, doctors pass it on in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes that they need to make in order to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, full-day sitting in front of the TV and using the means of transport instead of walking for a short walk.
Overweight also causes a large calorie intake, that is, greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no asphalt in UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature.
If the tile lining was properly taken care of, the lining of the lining would not need to be repaired almost 200,000 linings after each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, Rafael Herrer N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) would have warned the lining of the lining.
In his lecture, the Technological Cause of Explosives, which he spoke in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture of asphalts having similar characteristics to asphalts, but at the same time dissipate the asphalts.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the formation of excavations.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is a group of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight called asphalts, and others with a low molecular weight called maltenes.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity, and at 50 degrees is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day depending on the weather conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering expert warned.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible tile, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the topmost layers is an asphalt insert, formed by small stones embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that makes up the insert is filled with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is thus possible for the forces in the tiles to disperse well.
If it were modified asphalt, they would disperse even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that on the asphalt insert is placed the last layer called the coat, made of fine stone, that is, sand also poured into the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have a greater mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must ensure friction of the track.
Since as part of the tile will be exposed to a large load, the coat must be sufficiently thick and pay attention to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a big impact on the functionality of asphalt inserts.
Once the terrain is damp, the water spreads inwards and is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all layers of the tile and thus the formation of cracks.
He explained that during the creation of the extrusions, the first film of the coat is damaged and only after that the asphalt insert is damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one point, but it is a slow process that should stop already at the first signs using suitable maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of bulges, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of the tile must correspond to the load of the vehicles and must ensure that this load does not exceed the load.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do and research is in the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and make it easy to repair the outflows without having to use them.
What was missing from the candidate from Valle in order to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not win the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first overmiss.
Valle del Cauca did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia again.
Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of the winners, earning a silver crown and a sherpa, on the basis of which she became the new first multi-miss Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday’s finals, Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Isabella (1989), Is (1999), Is), Is (1990s), Is, Is), Is, Is, Is, Is, Is,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s
A question that many people ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the great favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she is about to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for free became the Royal Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volge. These titles were achieved by, for example, the Missiles from Talium Vargas and Natalia Navarro.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name her only the First Multi-Miss was the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?", which was put down by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez.
To the candidate’s question, she replied:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me the most in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book with the title "La sangorE".
This response was not liked either because of the term "culturalization" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned meant to her.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and delighted with the result: “The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The little prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> journalist suggested that the fact that she was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one that took away all the previous awards (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother) aroused the envy of other candidates.
This was evident at the first presentation of the swimsuits at Hilton Beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Although she glittered at both, it was known that she lacked the strength and ignition presented by representatives from Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for "As Home" on Canal RCN, believes that Melinda won the title of first overmiss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition ultimately does not leave with the Queen's crown.
Moreover, Valle has had a rather rude attitude towards the media in recent days and it did not pay off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just to the brink, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the Miss Colombia beauty contest in itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects even before they enter the competition."
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to deficiencies in her background and fibrosis, which was visible on the buttocks. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her as a physique "natural beauty" for the healthiest active body, and rightly so.
Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, who prepares the Queen, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on the butt, which in my opinion were not too noticeable, wore her dots until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that Valle's cousin made a mistake when she underwent several surgeries.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they have failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong side, and here she chose her tax.”
Because of this award, which was awarded for the first time by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the swimsuit parade, there was a cruel prediction, which was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina gave, so that he did not have to give her the best.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina has started the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, to which she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, it will enter history as one of the queens, who, despite the staggering success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonso Cana.
Cali's fingerprint expert has entered history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, last year, a CTI fingerprint expert in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of Farc’s supreme leader, “Alfonse Cana,” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint specialists working for the CTI department, this week it was the turn of Elias Gonzalez, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been working in judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in a town hall in Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to penetrate the forest for more than five days to get to the spot where the dead had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. palms of hands and feet.
In the week when the operation was carried out against Alfonso Can, they told Elijah to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected to happen.
On Friday night, he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead bodies and that one of them is suspected to be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to take a card with Guillermo Leon S<0xC3><0xA1>enz's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigative team to the place where the body was found, he did not recognize it due to physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beards, dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galton flap, ink, and transplanter and light, Eliasar began to compare the dactylo records of the dead with the records from the card.
She didn't disappoint: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the Puerto Tejada-born man was commissioned to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, whether it was really the Supreme Commander of the Farc.
Searching for traces
For the dactyloscope of Siena de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Elijah Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at the press conference of Operational Services against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of a mistake, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying the dead, these people help investigate criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When caught, a lot of delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall in the house, because the thief relied on this place to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not meant to be fingerprinted, but in this case we could get the fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in the event of a murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the fingerprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was indeed a murderer, it is clear that he appeared at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that the fingerprints are “wiped using chemical or physical reactive substances” from the objects.
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used for their collection.
Then the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians at the moment, whose data are not recorded anywhere," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown on the CSI TV show.
Like everything that glitters, there is no gold, not on everything you touch, there are traces left.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Corruption" protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters rushed to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stay.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the space and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked a New York City representative on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square by court order, from where they were taken this morning, after they tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters rushed to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order that allows the "disappeared" to return to the scene. The second part of the movement responded to the cleanup by taking the park to the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through assembly and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the movement, "Let's Settle the Street Wall."
Bray said the response to the camp’s evacuation, ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, came to a court where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stand by and out of the camp.
In addition to the "defamation" they also took another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the site of a parish in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take their place, but then the police came and arrested some of the demonstrators. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw that they had also placed ties to some journalists.
The organization says several hundred people have settled on the site, and a delegation of religious representatives has also come to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to members guarding the square, triggering “some small clashes,” Bray said, condemning the fact that some police protesters beat.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Occupy Wall Street movement or using “laws that were published after the protests began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places that they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city suspended the reopening of the public space and warned the protesters that local laws do not allow them to return tents and bunk beds.
The city's top official personally prevented the early removal of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and accessed because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it became "a place where people didn't go to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases hurt others" because "some shops got threatening letters" and "neighbours were worried about the quality of their lives."
“The morning clean-up was horrific and shows Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “disregarding freedom of expression.”
Representatives of the Occupy Wall Street movement also said they planned to organize "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months after the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, they will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Private CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will play the role of the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known for internet-based home pornographic footage, appears with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in the trenches depicting Jesus.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian Indian comedian who recently acted as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears on the stage.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear on a special Christmas CTV show.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "scooter" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is coming back to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the period of decline that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyu government counted material losses of $300,000 million, a wound that is well-cured despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September was in such a position that it was possible to turn the page with final validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
In addition, the results of the second quarter – for the Japanese tax year starting in March 2012 – predict the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery that is necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending falling by 0.9% compared to the period January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to take advantage of the crisis in order to get out of it reinforcement or to restore infrastructure: it is a matter of taking advantage of the shortcomings in order to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up. Particularly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma
The current currency has been entrusted to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "saving values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying U.S. forecasts. It is a privilege that is at the same time a great burden for exports.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to the yen price in September.
While markets continue to be occupied by EU marginalized countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
“We need to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen,” Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, said in a statement.
The prospects are not really encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economies of the major powers are slowing down.
It fell by four decades to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area even fell below the average, which is at the level of 100. It reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens Spreads Uncertainty Again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With fast and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty resurfaced, Greece is increasingly entangled in a labyrinth leading to the exit from Europe’s major debt crisis.
The presumption that the “agreement” of the new Greek transitional government is given by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received at his appointment will probably be short for their application, the chairman of the Conservative Party of the New Democracy, the n<0xC3><0xA1>pak n<0xC3><0xA1>pak<0xC3><0xA1> n<0xC3><0xA1>p, n<0xC3><0xA1>pop n<0xC3><0xA1>p.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clarify any doubts about his stance: “We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
In his address to the EU and the IMF, the president of the Conservatives went a little far. These organizations are to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. But at the same time he said that he would not support and sign any commitments regarding the implementation of the austerity measures.
The European Commission, already dismayed by the impact of Papandreou's playing with the referendum, yesterday stressed that its demands are insurmountable: it will not unlock any help unless the new government and the representatives of the main parties sign a "written commitment without any ambiguity".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will negotiate with the new government on "what it needs to pay the sixth part" 8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
The Greek squirrel has so much more to wear.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the privileged position of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position on a global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sophia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of servitude for social progress, justice and hope for a better future."
Yesterday, the Queen began the 5th World Microloan Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" for us to achieve the Millennium Goals, which the United Nations has set for 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in every corner of the planet and take this task responsibly," Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and the contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, will "should be carried out by the p<0xC3><0xAA>chn<0xC3><0xAA>t<0xC3><0xAA>ts, and will be able to make the most of the work.
"We have already achieved a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The Microloans Summit is intended not only to be a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty threshold they currently live under.
The concept of micro-loans has spread to Spain and other countries of the world after “the pioneer of Muhammad Yunus’s thought has embarked on this journey,” the Queen said, adding that it is “an act of justice and necessary recognition.”
She described the instrument's father as "an admirable idealist who went on a road to combat poverty." She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago, when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted directly with his loan policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by another. The first worldwide summit in Washington and another meeting such as in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to observe the constant development of the culprit," explained the queen of the culprit, "the culprit of the culprit", who, thanks to her support for this project, "explained the culprit of the culprit.
Queen Sophia ended her performance by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thus enabling them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity was "an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must abide by.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of ballot trade, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a “serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty,” and now more than ever, governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become victims.
For Spain, microloans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people with whom everyone else closes the door. The mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed the participants in the city.
CDU proposes to elect European President on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, without serious trouble for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party president.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it only happened in the autumn, especially to satisfy the members of the party, who consider the government's policy today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
The few-minute ovations come to the conclusion of Angela Merkel’s speech, and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubts.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
According to the Chancellor of Europe, “the time has come for change.”
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the eurozone member states, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "with a view to giving Europe one vote".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Britain is opposed, and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same stance.
But the direction is outlined.
Similarly, delegates have rejected a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank’s presidency depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously lead to a strengthening of Germany’s weight.
Led by concern to calm the climate inside her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to get Congress talking about "small" European states or countries in trouble willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe deals with one paragraph of the importance of "France-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not cite France.
Just indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Lipsk.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes fraud in the case of incapacity for work?
After the support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will address a recurring theme since 2007 on combating social fraud and redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First of all, because of budget savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of incapacity to work before they start receiving support for the disease.
Clearly, without the company’s consent, an employee who is sick would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
The measure, which risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which according to the newspaper Les Echos could bring in 280 million euros.
And also measures that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic scope: to give public servants one day of unfettered incapacity for work (so far they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority also triggers a fraud theme that this time focuses on crimes related to incapacity for work.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you get caught, you'll be back," Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about inequalities in employment.
These have in fact been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political support, which have brought fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008, daily allowances amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion, representing 5% of healthcare expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% were related to maternal allowances and work injuries and 54% were related to incapacity to work, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That’s only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that hides certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the job site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they hadn’t chosen a working day.
Another study, this time conducted by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity for work was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no more susceptible to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absences (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain.
Fraud in incapacity for work is only a very small part compared to black work.
When it comes to fraud, these are only of small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on incapacity to work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM found that 13.8% of the 285,000 checks carried out due to short-term incapacity were "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically monitored incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of "unadapted or unauthorised" cases were counted to 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unauthorised" cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than the number expressing the work in black.
According to UMP member Dominique Tiana, author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and therefore infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to revitalize its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke before the parliament and added that the 100 days given to his government unity will not be enough to carry out this task.
"In order to put our economy back on the ground, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout plan," the prime minister said in a speech on Wednesday, in which he gave his first public speech at the beginning of the debate on the vote on votes in parliament.
Implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country’s public deficit would be “about 9%” of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The law rejects the new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed his support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on the targets of deficit and debt reduction and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties to support the proposed measure, Antonis Samaras responded by saying that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything.
euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalised, says commission of experts
According to a report by the Royal Society of Canada, Canadians are denied death.
With regard to palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best possible palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives with the idea of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if such a choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cited a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “medicalization of death in Canada has led to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts mandated by the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies across Canada, while in the province of Québec this figure is highest with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it wants nothing to change the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts, who have also taken control of all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes some abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-humans.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, the co-author of the report, confirmed at a teleconference yesterday more than many cases of these hurdles in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
“Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
According to a 2010 survey conducted by the Angus Reid Forum, 85% of Canadians have already expressed their support for euthanasia because they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of lesser value.
In the case of persons who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents feel that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed rejection is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires that medical professionals be trained to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best possible palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final sedation already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already voiced their reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a medical law specialist, called the position of the report's experts-signatories "extreme" because, among other things, it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who should be over 18 years old could ask for help in committing suicide,” Pierre Deschamps, who studied the reports, said in a statement.
P. Deschamps also stresses that it appears that the authors of the report have placed a person’s autonomy above all the other values that form the social premise of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, particularly doubts the data of the report regarding the absence of defects in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordanian King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus is talking about a "conspiracy"
Syria Is Increasingly Isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters protested in front of the Foreign Ministry.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who with Russia’s support is resisting them and talking about a “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighboring Syria, took an opinion in favour of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "transfer power" in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at his heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country, told the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that efforts to mediate under the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, citing Syria's neighbouring country, against which Turkey is increasingly applying a tougher line.
The United States welcomed the “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the disrespectful conduct of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are increasingly applying a tougher tone" against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime’s forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed "in shootings and concentrated shooting of heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was “going on a journey out of the crisis”.
He also reacted lively to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus' membership, which he said was a "dangerous step".
“Syria will not bow,” he added, assuring that “the plots against Syria will not succeed.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the League of Arab States is currently considering a “civilian protection mechanism” and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also favours the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s “paranoid” repression.
A new special meeting of the League is called for tomorrow in Rabat to take an opinion on the plan for the resolution of the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and in which it was envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from cities crushed by divisions and the liberation of detainees.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the decision of the League of Arab States "wrong" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
ITALIAN
Monti Demands Time and Victims in Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that will contain “victims” in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers.
It should consist of a relatively thin cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important program with many victims," Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many parliamentary groups involved in the talks, said after meeting with a designated prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a statement of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will conclude with the introduction of Mario Monti’s small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness in the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democracy there are exact terms" regarding the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that the markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as president was initially favorably received by the markets, but concerns reappeared after the unexpected September collapse of industrial production in the eurozone.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept "policies".
He expressed the conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with an extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy "a strong element" of Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn’s spokesman stressed that “even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change”.
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria business union chief Emma Marcegaglio, who met with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth can not meet the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognized for his professional knowledge and independence as a "professor" symbolizing the "call to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
A big unknown will be the life span of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place government bonds worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for nuclear weapons, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the United Nations.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, which draws extensively from the documents of the IAEA, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was supposed to work for three decades from the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was supposed to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the explosive method.
In 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic troubles were supposed to lead him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was then to cooperate on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear data that the development of Iran's detonation system" was "derived from the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency about it in advance - worked on the program itself during a substantial part of his career.
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined slightly or rose slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase compared to 13% in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in crimes against Jews.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
“After the loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” said Human Rights First, “the rise in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior member of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these crimes,” he adds, and estimates that this could be done by improving police reporting of “hate crimes.”
"Hate crime" in U.S. federal law is the legacy of the Civil Rights War.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now even sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
Twitter’s microblogging site introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, somewhat resembling its Facebook services.
The new "activity" and "name" offers allow you to better and directly know the activity of other people who are following you or people whose responses ("tweets") you are following.
This lets you know whether they allow you to track posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat unintelligible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday to recommend following an other user) doing the bonhéur des initiés, s'ouvre<0x2B> and a grand public augment augment augmentation plus public.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it takes up a lot of space and it looks too much like Facebook,” he wrote.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some of the elements of my Twitter," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austria-Hungary
Enrollment of the Golden Rule on a Balanced Budget in the Constitution
The government of the large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include the "golden rule" of fiscal policy in the constitution with the aim of reducing the public deficit and avoiding any reduction of the valuation by the agencies.
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the <0xC5><0xA0>KODA or <0xC5><0xA0>KODA.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay three billion euros more on interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, a Christian Democrat.
Austria is thus continuing to request the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that, by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the balance of public accounts be included in the constitution or the law.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to decline every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), and starting in 2017, the federal state’s public structural deficit will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal government will be able to outpace both countries and the federal government.
The aim is to achieve public debt by 2020/21 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong Only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they were to continue to strengthen.
"We'll catch up, as we did last time, if we find too much volatility," Yen's exchange rate was quoted as saying by the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only climbed back to the historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yens for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which recently broke the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But it’s only since that time that it has steadily risen supported purchases by investors who consider it a “safe port” in the uncertain times of the world’s economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar again fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen latitude to close to the levels triggered by the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This fluctuation of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it costs the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues generated by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, Y. Noda, who fears that this treachery will not kill the yen yet in the egg of fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of disaster-infected households.
But the prime minister ruled that the high value of the yen did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's multi-governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" indicating that no further monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Issues increased its purchases of state Treasury vouchers by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling on the purchases of various securities in order to flood the lake.
Eurozone:
The prices are rising, the stocks are failing.
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to grow.
European exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
“With new tensions surrounding borrowings from eurozone countries in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to generate only a fraction of recent profits.”
“Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% decline, which suffered due to concerns from market participants about Europe’s ability to cope with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized," Mitsu<0xC5><0xA1>ige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said in a statement.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the eurozone is damaging to the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
In 10 hours, the European currency has a value of $1.3570 with a 0.4% recession.
According to the currency brokers, the cover came after CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal that would allow countries to leave the eurozone in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish tariffs far beyond the 6% limit
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrisome level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds reached 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds was 6.2%.
These tensions, affecting the interest rates of the southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded time on the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of her debt.
Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 will be the “main task” of his government.
Spain is once again at the forefront of the market when elections to the House of Representatives take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread rate gap between Germany and Spain's ten-year bonds has reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of the numbers reporting the growth of the euro area
According to statistics, France recorded 0.4% growth in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected 0.3% growth.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised the figure downwards in the second quarter to a 0.1% decline in GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it is the fourth quarter that concerns the economies the most.
For its part, Germany recorded an increase of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such investments and a place that occupies energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French have to base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause doubling the demand for electricity by 2050 if we don’t want to rid a significant part of the world’s population of important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to face a lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, and we must not forget the necessary need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases in order to combat climate change, which is what we want.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
And that’s why Germany remains on its own in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case with Belgium, which is subjecting its decision to find another resource capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the last generation of power plants.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, are continuing their commitment in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by renovating the construction of one power plant interrupted after the accident at the Three Mile Island power plant.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will be manifested by the increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be taken into consideration.
The European champion in wind turbines, which draws 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to the irregularity of the wind, which is why the CO2 emissions and prices of Danish electricity are higher by 65%, respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity bill 40% higher than the payment made by French households.
While in a globalized economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and ensuring that industry stays on its national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of Europe’s most expensive electricity.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they are not fundamentally opposed to this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Recall that our country’s energy policy has enabled the construction of an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 consecutive jobs.
The highly exporting sector is attracting a large number of small and medium-sized specialised firms to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be relocated abroad.
If France decided to leave the nuclear plant, it would sacrifice a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year to the country’s exports of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to run for 60 years, while the downfall of its manufacturer would be planned?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for the production of energy, even if there is no diabolical one.
The development of low-carbon facilities, nuclear facilities and renewable energy facilities by the French industrial group AREVA is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as over the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of blood safety.
Fifty years later, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island was in normal operating conditions and was left without human casualties and environmental impacts.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of the reactor and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accidents were the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as it has learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and constructors is that the EPR-type reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those looking to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to rivals of the AREVA group and EDF and freeing the way to take a leading position in the nuclear field.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations control the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the numbering of police, courts and administrations subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the "country of human rights" that France boasts.
Recently, it was administrative harassment that was targeted by foreign students, which became topical when the Interior Minister (see the May 23 release) declared that France "doesn't need foreign talents, butchers and waitresses".
But so far it has rarely been discussed from an economic point of view.
It must be said that in this area there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right.
To the right, in 1976, Jacques Chirac stated in his statement that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and to the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept the whole world poor".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of hordes of Polish installers on French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we strive to provide to immigrants.
In his programme, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to banality when he states that the common development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p.
Immigration restrictions are detrimental to growth and to the detriment of employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to lower their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by doing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive Influence on Wages
Just as the surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants cause immigrant incomes to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% will lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
In European countries, migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average, of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 for the rest of his life to the public budget.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed at the beginning of his term of office the wish to meet for the missing percentage of growth "with the teeth devalued".
The teeth used to repel immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invents democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and also a very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, because despite the fact that it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced during the twentieth century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Pluto.
Some people might have believed that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make the choice and make it in the most direct way possible.
However, it is already known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
The universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an “instrument of repression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been so since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of a Greek referendum of the type ‘yes’ will not have the value of a double revelation in this direction: a revelation of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also a revelation of a disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic uprising have shifted today, and many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot achieve anything if we demand a number of national referendums organized according to necessity and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolutist monarch or jump with his feet tied to the empty nationalist depth: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want a guillotine knife, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous performance of election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we wouldn't know where to stop the census - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its incapacity and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
It is urgently necessary to restore the governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For it is only together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governments and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will entail decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would have brought us into disarray.
After a long time of fighting against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands the European economic government.
Budiz.
But to think about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as citizens as such, would be a new madness and a new blind alley.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to form a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
A revolution in the interest of this could not have been enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This can only be achieved by building a Europe that is more politically democratic and a true European democratic supremacy.
Let us become Europeans in order to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chip Card Fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, in 2011, sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM phones) will increase by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable is the segment of contactless technology that allows you to pay on public transport or to handle purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide versus 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the APEC, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and are accepted by 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But the big business chains work for two.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
In order to rank a higher rate of speed, it is necessary for banks to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed themselves to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is necessary for the execution of transactions, is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They're getting late."
"But their real expansion is expected to take place next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales of 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which lasts from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without touch.
Terrorist Front from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are ties between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria "has gained certainty" about it from now on.
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he said, without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate bridges.
After AQMI members were kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their abductors during an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the aftermath of the attack, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Terrorist Part
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has been in Maiduguri for a long time, a town in northern Nigeria that is the dome of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to have AQl<0xC3><0xAD>.
“It’s progress, but we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about the operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has become more and more apparent in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
A quick success.
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Muhammad Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in Haoussa means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The sect is politicized and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters engage in a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extraordinarily active and multiplied their attacks on police stations.
The government’s response is the same as usual.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, the founder of the sect, is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its headquarters in the north.
At Christmas 2010, an attack in the city of Jos killed 80 people, followed by another one in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN’s local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now worrying all security specialists.
Now that the Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Igers and the Somalis of the Al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "deliver all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
When it comes to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry take the lead in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
At the hearing of the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating blatant statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, or Israel’s aid are intertwined.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican “Grand Old Party” nomination race, threatened the Chinese with calling before the World Trade Organization and accusing them of “manipulation of their currency,” which is a bearish theme in America’s crackdown on large-scale migration.
Worse, if this must involve the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, nearly stumbled upon a stance that “cools” emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is in last place in the election estimates, remains unheard of.
The image of President Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions do not succeed in stopping its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will imprison Iran,” he said fanfarefully.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also pledged to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his duties towards the partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China’s military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capabilities” – an obvious unknown fact that China has owned nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and still won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They underline the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the unsuccessful departure of the “boys” from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of the weak.
But the attack is not easy.
The population views President Obama’s national security policy, which removed Ben Ladin, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to deterrence.
And with arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leading position, Obama taps into the right place.
Nord Stream, the new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and led along the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to operate.
It has to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly underwater.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the valve controlling the Russian gas inlet into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will flow into Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomeranian Commonwealth.
The second pipeline, to be completed by the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be supplied, which is equivalent to the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries protested strongly against the project.
Nord Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being transported to the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats of shutting down access to Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
This was most strongly expressed by Warsaw when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with a reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying that this is a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, because the project has created gaps between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Just five years ago, Russia was able to pursue its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy, high-gas-consuming Western states whose bearings are nearing their end.
“This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,” Fillon said at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom’s leaders, who are present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply site.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a significant technical act.
The submarine pipe is made of steel equipped with a concrete shell to protect it from the anchorages of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, minefields dating back to the Second World War had to be avoided.
“For their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, a spokesperson for Nord Stream.
Measures for the protection of fauna and flora had also to be stepped up.
The pipe itself is a long metal hose weighing like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted anywhere in its entire length by either valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was supposed to be built near Sweden, but the project leader rejected it when the Swedes were only reluctant to see the Russian state company as it was permanently settling off their coast.
“In the event of a failure, we will stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute,” explains Jens Müller.
In the event of a gas leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, since the welds were designed to create a gap once every 100,000 years.
The gas pipeline’s condition is checked from the outside by an underwater robot pulled by the ship, while the gas pipeline’s interior is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is compressed by gas.
It will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts during the three-day journey at 3 m/s.
The long-distance pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without requiring the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased to this company a five-year contract that could be renewed, all its gas transport capacity.
“Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported,” explains Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will come back to them, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
Gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlet gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to once again provide the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves of faded white colours as if they were old-fashioned.
After all, Moleskine’s notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan at the time, decided to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is about to introduce a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of leather), which is used for example to adjust the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was very much appreciated by the writer and traveller.
“Moleskine has returned to the popularity of an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compose any artificial portrait of the buyer, as the note will appeal to businessmen as well as students or professionals.
Moleskine’s note is that its owners are people who are cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded.
A small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC chain of stores to small boutiques in the city centres, where he was able to promote his identity.
“We followed the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened an exhibition "Zach<0xC3><0xA1>zka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, she also released new records resembling a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is expanding to a wide range of carriers.
Success that sparked envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, investment funds, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today is the 15th week for the employment of disabled people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons with disabilities is even twice the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it shrinking?
“No,” says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of Persons with Disabilities.
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, there is still much to be done."
It must be said that for unemployed persons with disabilities, there are many obstacles to their entry into employment.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a degree and out of the 2.3 million college students there are only 10,000 disabled.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% of people with disabilities compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to get back to work and that are “the core of the problem,” according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses take in disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
It remains unspoken, ways of thinking, which are certainly developing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the managers surveyed had "a poor level of knowledge about disabled people" with "excessive perception of people in a wheelchair and mental or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employing 6% of disabled workers as set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which come from 2008, indicate the status quo of 2.6%.
“Now we’re moving around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, charged with collecting fees from companies that don’t comply with the law.
Evidence is the number of "punished" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 enterprises committed to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises," he said.
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What a Luck"
Before Tuesday night (20:45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was an association between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other at the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard briefly reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach delivered only words of praise to his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," said the French player from Lille.
When it comes to the difference between his performance in club matches and national team matches, "it's the same, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my brand."
Gambling, investigated against Romania on Thursday evening over this match against France, arrives at the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "light up".
The term “joy” cannot be ignored.
Play against Bleus, who he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning draws in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he said.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
More so, because opposites"are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We were crucifixing right away."
"To be able to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens also kindly reminded me of “pride.”
"Pride" to fight"match - holidays".
"The pride" also to note in the quality"neighbors", that France has become a very high-level team a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc has done a huge piece of work," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French in the direction of... Brazil.
“Our little Belgians are going to be big,” he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next games." Including against France.
Portugal is very self-confident
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is starting with great optimism a barrage against Bosnia (22:00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese national football team, whose steering wheel has been in place since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
In fact, Portugal is 90 minutes apart from happiness.
You have to play every match and every opponent - Bosnia.
With Friday's score (0-0) in the Hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of dominance, but it was not able to score a goal so rare that it would relieve him.
"It's a good result, but it's risky because we didn't score outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of an audience that should create a boiling pot there, even if the match certainly looks like "very balanced," says the optimist, but he would consider Bento.
"We are looking forward to a very balanced match, but we are fully convinced that we can have a top score," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroze, the successor to the Euro 2012 team, said in a statement.
The indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An undecided match can be enough for Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's risky because we didn't score outside," Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities," he added.
Just like in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that "they do not have time to think."
It's a good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
