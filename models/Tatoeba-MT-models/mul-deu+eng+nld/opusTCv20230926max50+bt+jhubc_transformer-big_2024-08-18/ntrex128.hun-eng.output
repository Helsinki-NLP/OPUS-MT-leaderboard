Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will find themselves in the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were applauded for the proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The disaster came after the rise, the name of the National Assembly should be the Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Now, representatives of different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title may make them a laughing stock.
According to one of the Labour Party’s representatives, their faction is concerned that their new name will rhyme with the words “Twp” and “Pwp”.
Not for the sake of our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means the same thing, and pwp means cocoa.
According to one of the representatives of the Plaid party, the whole faction is "dissatisfied" and therefore suggesting alternatives.
One of the Conservative MPs said his faction was “open” to the name change, but noted that it was only one leap from the MWP to the “Muppet”.
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh the letter "w" is pronounced "u" in the same way as in Yorkshire English, which means MWP pronounced "map".
The position of the Committee of the National Assembly responsible for drafting the bill introducing the name change is as follows: "As regards the titles for the appointment of the members of the National Assembly, of course, the final decision is in the hands of the representatives."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation, which proposed the inclusion of the name of the Welsh Parliament and which received broad support.
With regard to the title of representatives, the Commission prefers the title of Welsh Parliament Member (representative of the Welsh Parliament) and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation has rather supported the MWP alternative.
MEPs are coming up with new and new alternatives, but the deal is rather difficult, which is a problem for the Speaker of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The law on reforms will also affect other aspects of the work of the National Assembly, including the disqualification of Members and the Commission's structures.
Members will be able to cast their final vote on their own titles during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on changing the country's name.
On Sunday, citizens voted to change the country’s name to “the Republic of North Macedonia.”
The aim of the referendum is to bring an end to a decades-long debate with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour, in his name, essentially supports a territorial need, and has repeatedly objected to its request for EU and NATO admission.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on the change of name and thus does not participate in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise they need to make for their EU and NATO accession.
The churches of Harlem in a difficult situation, also the bells of St. Martin were silent
“Moreover, as I hear from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“None of them today.”
As he says, the disappearance of the bars would have been understandable.
“People are going in a different way these days,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the social lounge where people run out on a daily basis.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not replace the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will be held back where they started.”
Instead of the temples, he adds, there will be residential buildings, the community of which also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy an apartment in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and this will further speed up the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments will join the faith community.”
Both churches were built by white churches even before Harlem had grown into the city of blacks – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the 1930s.
It was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
The St. Martin church was taken over by the Black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend’s boycotted leadership of Harlem’s shopping street, 125th Street against blacks or blacks who are unwilling to sell their products.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell was built at the request of the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bells as "the bells of the poor".
In July, an expert on the bell toy said that the bell toy was “a cultural heritage”, “an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world’s first bell-tower, voiced by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who 18 years ago joined the larger bell-tower of the Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin did not hire anyone to replace him.
In St. Martin, a complex situation has emerged in recent months with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who were partly involved in the secular management of the church, partly in the episcopal office.
The governing body of the parish, the church council, addressed the episcopal office in a letter in July, arguing that the office would “clear the costs” for the council, although the council did not participate in the office’s contracted architects and architects.
Some members of the faith community complain about the lack of transparency around the office’s house.
Capa attacked a 13-year-old boy in California while hunting
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy during a snail hunt on the opening day of the snail season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he became aware that a boy was screaming for help, and then drove several of you there to help him get out of the water.
Hammel at first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then realized that the boy was yelling, "He's got it!
He's been bitten!"
"His shoulder was torn at the keybone," Hamel said, as he saw what he had seen when he came to the boy.
“I started shouting so that everyone could get out of the water, ‘There’s coffee in the water,’” he added.
The boy was transported to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As Captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier sharks had been spotted in the area, but then it was found to be one of the non-humanly dangerous species.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
Authorities have closed the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the time of the investigation and for security reasons.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's to expand into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's expert salesmen and wholesale-style pipe stands would compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
In the midst of the decline in the sales of fashion and household items, a growing volume of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the UK beauty market is also being tested in 11 stores across the country, and the success of this case is due to the fact that the chain is already testing larger pipe stands.
The reinforcement of the pipe line is due to the fact that stores try to recharge the shelves previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household items in a variety of ways.
Sainsbury’s said it is doubling its supply to 3,000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it is now offering for the first time.
But the former brands, L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also be located in a larger area at booths by brands such as Boots and similar stores.
The chain is also relaunching the Boutique makeup family, in which most of the products are now vegan – because today more and more young buyers are looking for them.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened in Croydon, south London, and the other in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
With the spread of online shopping as well as the redirection of grocery shopping habits to small local retailers, wholesalers need to make greater efforts to deceive shoppers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says the supply will become more and more similar to mixed retailers as the store chain is trying to compete with discounted retailers and retailers by introducing more and more services and other products besides food.
Since buying the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury’s has opened hundreds of Argos classes as well as a few Habitat classes – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The store chain’s previous attempt to frame the beauty and pharmacy classes has been a failure.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate over the distribution of revenues for the pharmaceutical classes operating in its stores ended.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury’s three years ago sold its 281-store pharmacy business, the Celesion, which operates the Lloyds shoe chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to the store chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by transforming the look of our pipe stands.
In addition, we have recruited professionally trained staff who assist the interested parties with advice.
Our brand range caters to all needs, the attractive environment and the convenient location provide an allure that will take your shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones 'stolen' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones has left after Holly Willoughby’s television host discontinued an 11 million-million-dollar deal for his lifestyle product sales business to sign a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the truly brand that sells homewear and accessories.
The two celebrity companies were compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old director of This Morning announced on Instagram that he is coming out.
Holly Willoughby thoroughly pulled the hood out of The Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, when she emerged from their promising lifestyle-products business at the last minute – to be extraordinarily close to Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was “stunned” when the TV salutary announced during a tense meeting at the headquarters of Jones’s business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that they would be able to sell <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of new contracts to a number of people who had already signed them.
The two celebrities' ventures were compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truey, Jones traveled from the island to one of his vacation homes.
According to a source, “Truthy was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this in the long run, and this will give him his livelihood over the next few decades.
The fact that she came out was a complete surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, as the departure was so close.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods waiting for sale."
According to experts, the departure of This Morning’s show host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars of solid sums invested in a range of items ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-child show host and husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby Capp launched Truly in 2016 and took over the presidency in March of the 52-year-old Jones.
The two couple are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S producer and will take over Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night: “We don’t want to say anything about [Jones’] business.”
Hard words came out, “Then we fell in love”
He joked about what kind of criticism he would receive from the press for what some might consider “unprecedented” and why he said so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump allow so much?
Trump asked in a funny “reader’s” voice.
“I didn’t allow any.”
As he noted, Kim would also like to meet for a second time after Trump welcomed the first meeting in Singapore in June as a huge step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament, however, have deteriorated.
More than three months after the June Singapore summit, Ri Jongho, a representative of North Korea, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees, no “appropriate response” from the United States would be born.
Instead, he said, the United States will continue to maintain sanctions against the use of pressure.
Trump said in a campaign speech that he was much more optimistic.
“Things are going great with North Korea,” he said.
It was like we were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have lost there.
We have a very good relationship now.”
As he said, his efforts to improve relations with Kim put positive results in the foreseeable future – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of U.S. troops.
He also explained why he talks about his relationship with Kim in such an unusual way.
“It’s not hard to behave in general, but now there’s not a crowd of ten thousand out there trying to get in, there’s only about two hundred standing in front of me,” Trump said.
Indonesia: Hundreds of dead in tsunami and earthquakes rocking the island
After the Lombok earthquake, Indonesia has refused to help international aid organisations in the region.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be evacuated, no national disaster was reported, which would be a prerequisite for international aid.
“In the past, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult,” Sumung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a rescue team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in on-site rescues.
Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Protection Agency, said Indonesian authorities are currently conducting an assessment of the situation in Bali to see if there is a need for the involvement of international aid organisations.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared for the destructive power of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh province, this is not common in other coastal areas.
While there was a tsunami signal, the apparent lack of a tsunami signalling siren system in Palu also contributed to the development of a disaster that claimed lives.
Transport between the Indonesian islands can be difficult even in the best time.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before the disaster hit the area.
President Joko Widodo put the development of Indonesia’s crumbling infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and did not save on costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now facing budget deficits ahead of next year’s elections.
In addition, the president must also face the ongoing anti-ecclesiastical tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have begun to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to be deployed as a result of the riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs fell to each other with carvers, bows and arrows on the streets, as well as other mounted weapons.
Video: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge scores a huge equaliser against Chelsea
In a Premier League game at London's Stamford Bridge, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool by a 89-minute goal, which was not lost to Chelsea.
His team suffered a 0-1 loss when Sturridge received an induction from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal.
He first put the ball to the left and then threw a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot went high above the sixteenth, and went towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reached the net above the seeding Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get in position because there’s always someone like Shaq who is forwarding the ball, so I tried to get myself in as good a position as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I just took it off, then I didn’t think much and I shot him.”
Chelsea took the lead in the halftime 1-0 after winning the lead in the 25th minute with a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the battle of the blues, Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> passed the ball with the corners, then managed to break off in the middle, and sprint into the Liverpool area.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> started after a quick shot and got the ball back in his midfield.
Then, with a beautiful hand, he launched Hazard towards the sixteenth.
Hazard ran the defense, and eventually sent the ball to the remote corner of Liverpool's gate next to Alisson Becker with a ball shot.
As the next season of the Champions League group games, Liverpool will meet Napoli on Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will play against Videoton on Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League.
There are 832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the local disaster protection agency said on Sunday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday and the six-metre-high tidal wave in its wake have buried several people, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press release.
The streets of Palu with more than 380 thousand people are covered by the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in connection with the woman being stabbed
Police launched an investigation into the murder case after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Mercedes, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. and was arrested on suspicion of murder of a 32-year-old man.
The police are asking residents of the area to report to anyone who has seen or died.
Superintendent Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still in its early stages, but this time I would like to ask anyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street and may have seen or heard anything to contact us.
In addition, I would like to ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera, to also look for us, because they may have information that is relevant to the investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman killed was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, the woman's friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning.
The investigation is underway and the police are currently conducting a notification of the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but he was informed by the police that no one can enter the building and no one can leave it.
When he found out what had happened, the man could not speak.
Residents of the building have now been informed that it may take even more hours before they can re-enter the building.
One of the police officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with her tears.
“It’s terrible,” he repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police minibuses were stationed inside the cordon and another outside.
Several police officers within the cordon were also watching the block.
Anyone with any information should write a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers without a name at 0800 555 111, and refer to file 247 of September 30.
Parliamentary statue of Cromwell is the latest victim of history rewrite fever
The expulsion of the statue could be a poetic truth, for which Cromwell and the followers of the fanatical puritan were enthusiastically destroying the cultural and ecclesiastical heritage of England at that time.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "stupidity", an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Palace of Westminster would eventually become a target sometime during the current debates on the removal of statues.
During the English Civil War, the imagery was not commissioned by Cromwell and executed.
So perhaps another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of Thomas, his ascendant from the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive depiction of Cromwell reflects the opinion of the nineteenth century, and makes a memory of a historical figure that is still to be celebrated by many today."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwellt may have been less than at the end of the 19th century, but many consider Parliament to be a protector against external pressure, which, of course, was external pressure in his case, the monarchy.
The question of whether this image is true remains the subject of a historical debate.
However, it is certain that this conflict, which arose in the mid-17th century, had an effect on the further development of our nation’s destiny, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
As a Lord Protector, we deserve to celebrate his achievements and remember them.”
Killing Pig Injured to Death of Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The name was found covered in blood from a man only identified as Yuan, with a stabbed stab wound next to a pig on the market in the city of Liupanshui in the province of Kujcsou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a breeding facility in Xining, China, on May 30, 2005.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby Jünnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found him on the man’s grave and discovered that the door of the neighbouring pig was open.
According to him, the huge guinea pig in the pig's mouth was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found that the 250-pound pig actually killed the owner.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody, and they were ripped apart,” he told Guiyang Evening News in the name of his cousin Wu.
According to security camera footage, Yuan entered the pig farm at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked away so that it could no longer harm others, while the police are investigating the traces on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly discussing compensation for the man’s death.
Although it does not occur often, it has been reported earlier that pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, on their Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a married couple and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales squeezed a farmer on a tractor until he was not able to alert his wife.
After an Oregon farmer had his own pig walled up in 2012, a Manitoba landlord told CBC News that while pigs are generally not prone to attack, the taste of blood can become aggressive.
“They are very playful.
Like the little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect,” he said.
Heavy rains in the wake of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern region of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it reaches the colder waters of Mexico's northern coastline.
Rosa, however, will continue to cause heavy rains in the coming days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
With winds of 140 km/h, Rosa struck as a Category 1 hurricane on the east coast at 5 a.m. on Sunday, 620 km southwest of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia.
The hurricane is expected to start northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone forms over the Pacific Ocean and begins to move westwards towards the western coast of the United States. As the Pink Moon approaches Lower California, tropical stormy areas are like tropical storms with heavy tropical storms.
On Monday, some areas of Mexico can receive up to 25 cm of rainfall.
Subsequently, the tropics encountering low-pressure masses will cause heavy rainfall in the coming days in the southwest.
Here, 3-10 cm of rainfall can cause sudden flooding, flooding with debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rainfall can occur anywhere from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in the southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest are expected to receive 5–10 cm of rainfall, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden floods may also occur, with rapidly decreasing strength due to the sporadic nature of tropical rainfall.
During tropical rains, it is especially not recommended to take a walk in the desert.
Due to severe rainfall, the canyons can turn into churning rivers, and the zivatars are occasionally accompanied by sudden winds and dust clouds.
The impending low-pressure masses may cause severe rainfall in some places on the southern California coast.
Up to 1.5 cm of rainfall is possible, which can cause minor flooding with debris and flat road conditions.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Weird tropical storms can occur in Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, and on Mondays and Tuesdays, rainfall also extends to wider areas.
Severe rainfall will spread to the Quay region on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States as the circumferential air masses cool down, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This can cause drastic temperature variations from time to time, even at short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is about 10 degrees.
In the coming days, it is expected that even the summer heat will be felt again in larger areas.
The central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to be warm in the first half of October, and temperatures from the southern part of the Great Plain to parts of the Northwest are expected to be around 25-30 degrees.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, temperatures in the eastern parts of the United States will likely outweigh the average temperature by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
A total of more than 20 million viewers on six television channels followed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate has not been resolved, and broadcasters have also had to interrupt the regular broadcast because of the last-minute Friday twist: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has been able to get the FBI out of jail for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that at the time a high school bully had captured Kavanaugh and tried to take him down.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
More than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen were likely to have seen the statements on Friday.
Nielsen was the average viewer of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels that mediated the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network numbers, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has a hard time measuring the number of people watching shows at work.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are used to being the football deciders or the Oscars giver.
According to Nielsen, of all channels, the Fox News Channel had the highest number of viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's audition.
In second place, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
CBS 3.1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
Interest has not diminished since the hearing.
The protagonist of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement saying that Senator Kavanaugh is putting his voice down, it was seen on CNN and CBS on Friday morning as a crowd of demonstrators were receiving a loud reception as the judge lifts it up.
He was staring at the scene for minutes while the crowd cheered, and CNN broadcasted the scene live.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said a woman to the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the public?”
Others cried out to him, “You have the power to do what so many women don’t.”
Flake only said that his office issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would share what he had to say at the hearing.
On cable and broadcasting channels, it was seen live hours later as the committee voted on whether to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for the vote.
However, Flake said he would only be willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as urged by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake was convinced of the need for this in his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision following conversations with the Coons and later other senators.
Flake lived up to his decision, as it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve the nomination of Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI crackdown on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Brexit Opponents of Political Play
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of jeopardizing the UK’s future and undermining the nation’s interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party’s conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview directly alongside May’s interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacks May’s so-called Chequers plan on Brexit, saying that the imposition of Britain and the EU to deal with each other’s tariffs is “complete.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Assassining LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims' death.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested on charges of manslaughter in a high-rise, police chief Baton Rouge said.
Police released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and announced that Sims' glasses had fallen during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene, and on it Simpson's DNA, it sounded on the WAFB channel that belongs to the CBS network.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police announced that the young man had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the lawyer’s report, the bail was set at $350,000.
According to a preliminary report released by the East Baton Rouge County morgue on Friday, the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The office thanked the Louisiana State Police Department for dealing with the fugitives, the State Police Crime Lab, the University Police and the residents of the area for assisting in the investigation into the suspect’s arrest.
LSU’s athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their “committed and persistent work in uncovering the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-metre-high striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also the LSU's coach.
Sims scored 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the final season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the news of Sims' death "shocked" and "shocked" the team.
“You’re always afraid that something like this happens,” Wade said.
Volcanoes flood Mexico City with ash
The ash ejected from Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After volcanic activity intensified in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash surveys took place in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Prevention called on the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several riots and riots.
In some districts of Mexico City, for example, in Xochimilco, the windshields of cars are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, 72 km southeast of the Mexican capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in September 2017 shook the central region of Mexico.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence party protesters clashed with police, and thousands joined the rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s split in the referendum.
A group of <0xC3><0x81>larcos separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the ramparts that held them back, so the streets that were crowded with tourists were now covered with dense powder paint.
In the later part of the day, further fighting broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with a rubber bottle.
The "We do not forget, we do not forgive" slogan-scandalous independence party groups and the "Long live Spain" slogan of unity party demonstrators stood against each other for hours.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated with minor injuries during the protests.
Tensions remain unabated in the region, which has been declared illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists in a referendum on 1 October.
Voters voted with a large majority in favour of the split, although the turnout was rather low, as the majority of Unionists boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly a thousand people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting in the polling stations with actions that sparked aggressive clashes.
The independence party groups were on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration that supported the national police force.
Although it was not prevented, the demonstration eventually did not go on the normal route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said there was no longer any chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
“I saw my parents pour tears of joy over what we could vote for, but for now our case has been cut short,” he said.
Although the regional elections in December last year achieved a significant, even if narrow, victory, the parties of the Catalan Independence Party have been difficult to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most well-known leaders have been forced to go into voluntary exile, or exile.
The 42-year-old carmaker, Joan Puig, who recorded the protest with his phone, said the conflict was shot by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he says.
Oriol Junqueras, a Catalan leader who has been awaiting preliminary arrests since last year, announced on Saturday that he will start the European Parliament elections next year.
"I can most strongly reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents if I participate as a candidate in the European elections," he said.
Londonderry: Police arrest three men who drove their car into a house
Police arrested a 33-year-old man, 34-year-old, and 39-year-old man who drove into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
You may have even been shot in the car with a serial number at a given moment.
Menga scored 1–0 for the Rangers at Livingston.
Dolly Menga's first goal to secure Livingston's victory
Livingston, who has just entered the first class, was a big surprise to the Rangers by adding Steven Gerrard, who has been coaching the Ibrox club for 18 games, to his second win.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference, as Gary Holt's team went into a deadweight competition with the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrardék remained without a foreign win in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they face the first-placed Hearts team, who are eight points behind.
But ahead of him, the Rangers are still waiting for a match in the Europa League against Rapid Wien on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, increased the division's inequalities to six wins, which means that last month's replacement, Kenny Miller, hadn't finished with the team yet.
Livingston missed a number of positions against the inaccurately played guest team
Dead's team could have won the lead well before the only goal of the match, as they had caused a lot of problems with their attacking games for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but too longed the attack, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved to be broad after slipping to reach his intersecting ball before Craig Halkett's goal.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game, as they were confident that they would be able to disturb the guests in fixed game situations.
The decisive goal was born out of a situation like this.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in the defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who used it to pay for the mid-16s.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in possession of the ball, but the domestic defense remained unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's door was barely in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the match, with the exception of a single situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was kicked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow lost to Livingston in another free kick.
The Cross-Balls made their way to Livingston's 16th, but the defending team was defeated every time. The attacking team did not win two penalty shootouts: one Halket entered against Glenn Middleton as a substitute, and the other was a pedigree.
"Phenomenal" game from Livingston – match analysis
Tony Macaroni Arena Reports by Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland
Livingston gave a phenomenal performance, and dropped the babysitters.
The players were one-on-one excellent, and in a row they exceeded expectations.
The team’s members and style of play have barely changed since returning to the front line, but Holt’s efforts also deserve serious recognition, since the coach’s arrival has greatly upset the team.
Several players have also brought their best form.
Halkett formed a huge team captain with his well-organized defense, and Menga was well-mannered by Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played with no idea.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard’s leadership, they were now unable to reach that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – by the way, they only managed to break the home defense once – so the Rangers had to get back together quickly as they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an found a mixed reception in Cologne
The morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin was pleasant and cheerful.
This was the last day of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police banned the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, including many Kurds, expressed their disapproval of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations exemplify perfectly the shared nature of the president’s policy, which is celebrated as a hero by some German citizens of Turkish descent, while others see the autocracy in it.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist crashed into a car and lost his life
He lost the life of a cyclist when he crashed into a car in London.
The caramel took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high-traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped and the attackers tried to help the bike, but he lost his life on the spot.
The collision took place just a few months after another cyclist was fatally gassed on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of Saturday’s crash.
According to a London police statement, the police are still working to determine the identity of the man in order to notify the relatives.
As a result of the investigation, roadblocks and bus disruptions make it difficult to transport, and the authorities advise that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Disturbance
Six prison guards were injured in riots in a heavily guarded man's prison, the prison's directorate reported.
The riots began at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at Long Lartin Arms in Worcestershire and have not yet been able to curb them.
In order to manage the situation, a special formation named "Tornado" was deployed on the site. The riots involved eight fugitives, who were confined to a building wing.
The members of the special unit suffered only minor head injuries, which they were able to provide on-site.
A spokesperson for the Penal Enforcement Organization said: “Specially trained prison guards are handling the situation at Long Lartin Arms.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, we will hand over those responsible to the police, and they can expect further prison sentences to be downloaded."
More than 500 convicts are being held at the Long Lartin men's arsenal, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to be given hospital treatment after one of the slaves attacked.
Last October, a special unit was also needed to deal with a serious disturbance, during which the prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (however, the situation in drought-affected areas may improve)
Arizona is seldom hit by tropical depressions, but this is what the state is expected to do at the beginning of next week, when a remnant of a hurricane named Rosa is sweeping through desert southwestern areas, drastically increasing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood preparedness from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as the southeastern areas of California and Utah; the preparedness is also in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to pass straight through the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring heavy rain.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service posted the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within 200 miles of Phoenix in the form of a tropical storm or depression!
For example, Hurricane Katrina (1967) has reached its limit of 40 miles.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50-100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the south-western desert areas (the central areas of the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, etc.) it can be expected to rain 25-50 mm, but in some places it can rain 100 mm.
The rains brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas not threatened by thunderstorms, as the area is currently hit by severe drought.
Despite the fact that floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall may have a beneficial effect on the south-western landscape facing drought.
“More than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is affected by minimal extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” according to the U.S. drought watchdog.com report.
Hurricane Rosa will hit the coast for the first time on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
It continues to be hurricane-like, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, it passes about 600 km south of the Mexican tongue of Punta Eugenia, and will go north at approximately 19 km/h.
The storm will encounter colder currents in the Pacific Ocean, and it will lose its power.
As a result, the coast of Mexico is expected to reach again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall can be expected, which significantly increases the chances of flooding.
“On average, rainfall could result in 70-150 mm of rainfall from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora, where it could rain 250 mm per place,” the report said.
Rosa then moves north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday, by which time it was already in the form of a tropical depression that swept through Arizona, reaching the southern territories of Utah on Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger caused by the Rosa and its remains will be extreme rainfall in Lower California, Northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening thunderstorms and flooding in desert areas, and in mountainous areas it must be feared from landslides.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 04:00 a.m. local time, an injured teenage boy was found in a neighborhood called Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital, his condition "stable".
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
Authorities are asking the public to contact them if anyone has a mobile recording of what has happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh had to suffer from “the anger and anger of the Democratic Party”
“Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Democratic Party had to suffer “his anger and anger.”
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where she resolutely and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that the man had committed sexual violence against her as a teenager decades earlier.
At the hearing, Ford also testified and stood up to his earlier claims.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans could see with their own eyes” the “brilliance and fearlessness of Kavanaugh.”
“The vocalists of our time, alongside Judge Kavanaugh, are among the most outstanding legal professionals of our time, who have an unshakable public service experience,” Trump said in a statement.
President Kavanaugh slammed his candidacy as he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Just five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not going to go, but I’m going to go,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are following the tactics of “resistance and obstruction.”
Kavanaugh's nomination for the first Senate vote is expected to take place no later than Friday, a leading Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia’s earthquake-induced rush hour, death toll rises
The price has smashed many, and at least 384 people have lost their lives when the huge waves hit the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tremor on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival held in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of nearly six meters (18 feet) high reached the coast at dawn, scattered many, and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The current was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
“When the flood warning sounded yesterday, people simply stayed on the coast, didn’t flee immediately, so they became victims of the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB).
“The source price not only came by itself, cars, trailers, houses, and everything else was shipped off the coast,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had flown at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before reaching the shore.
There were some who climbed the top of trees from the price and escaped, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palun.
The agency’s aerial footage of the disaster shows a number of destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks shook the coastal city.
Earthquakes could be detected in an area of about 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Technology Evaluation and Applications (BPPT), about 200 times more energy was released during Friday’s earthquake than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the geographical features resulting from this could reinforce the impact of the fountain price.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant", thousands of homes were destroyed in the disaster and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far is 540, and another 29 people are looking for.
According to Nugroho, in the coastal area 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, in the area called the Dongala, the number of casualties and the damage caused could be even higher, as it was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication was “completely depressed, you can’t get information about Dongal,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, announcing that the organization’s professionals and volunteers are already on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be even worse,” he added.
The agency received a number of criticism on Saturday for not informing the population of the flood that hit Palut, but according to the management, the waves had already reached the shore while issuing the alarm.
On one of the amateur footage shared on social media, a man is seen trying to warn street dwellers of the impending waterfall with desperate screams from the top floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, a huge wall of water hits the coast, transporting cars and buildings with it.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and flooding caused power outages, making communication in the Palu area impossible, making it more difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army has sent relief shipments from Jakarta and other cities by cargo planes, but officials say the evacuated population will continue to be in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was opened only to facilitate relief work and is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres set up by Palun on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian rush hour has exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
The World Vision team safely arrived from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found shelter under tent pavements erected in the office yard, but encountered traces of horrific destruction along the way, Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of houses falling into ruins,” he added.
“It’s very bad.”
While the relief teams contributed to the preparations for disaster relief work, some complained that foreign professionals with extensive experience in this area were not able to travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, all overseas aid, relief shipments and personnel can only be admitted to the territory of the country if the scene of the accident is declared to be a disaster-stricken territory at a national level.
That hasn't happened so far.
“The case continues to be treated as a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government acknowledges that it is indeed a national-level disaster, we can allow international relief services, but so far no announcement has been made.”
On the second night after Friday’s uprising and the flood, Palun’s friends and family members continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose salvation would be miraculously numbered, smuggled some light into natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, the workers were able to release a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days alongside the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national skating team, has prepared two riders from the missing skating skating team for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month, this time held in Indonesia.
In addition to the disappearances, other students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran sniper, what happened is a huge spiritual burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the ski umbrellas, for hours he desperately tried to reach out to the competitors who had just participated in the beach festival Palun on WhatsApp.
In addition to the messages, however, only one gray pipe appeared instead of two blue pipes.
“I think that means that the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
$26,750 stolen while charging an ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping mall
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from one of Brink’s employees, who was charging an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall, according to a press release from the Newport Police Captaincy.
The driver of the cashier's car just emptied a ATM in the entertainment center and was prepared to fill in with additional banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
A man “approached Brink’s employee from behind” while he was busy with his work and stole one of his prepared money bags.
Witnesses have also seen several suspected perpetrators fleeing the scene, but the police statement does not state the exact number of suspects.
Anyone who would provide information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper's name changed to Y<0xC3><0xA8>re
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: “The creature that was formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while, and this was the title of her eighth album, which was released in June.
He announced the change of name before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release a new album, Yandhi.
On the show, Ariana Grande takes over, citing "emotional reasons," said the show's producer.
The new name is not only an abbreviation of the rapper’s current artist’s name – it also has religious significance for West, according to his previous revelations.
“I know that ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier when he spoke to the Big Boy radio host about the title of his album.
So I am you and I are us and we are all one.
Kanye means the one and only Ye, which symbolizes the good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we really are.”
Ye is one of those famous rappers who love to change their name.
Sean Combs, for example, has also run under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he now prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West’s former co-creator, JAY-Z, also varied several times by whether his name should be written together, in parentheses, possibly in capital letters.
Mexico's President Says He Won't Put an Army Against Civilians
Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, President of Mexico, has pledged on the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bloodbathing student protests that he will never engage in military action against civilians.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador said on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on the square for participants of a peaceful demonstration, killing about 300 people when left-wing student movements showed signs of fortification in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans – to provide students with a monthly financial grant, and plans to set up additional free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and a lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The U.S. should double its funding framework for MI-solutions
As China becomes more and more active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for research in this direction, said Kai-Fu Lee, the proprietor of artificial intelligence-based solutions for Microsoft, which is the co-investor and application of Apple.
He then said that the U.S. government had made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country’s goal is to become the world’s number one MI developer by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for MI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly short of the US, and the next breakthrough in MI territory is on the way,” Lee said.
Doubling research grants could also double the chances of the United States taking the next big step in the field of artificial intelligence, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order) is published in this month's edition of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's book.
In the 1980s, he worked on an MI system at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the best American Othello player, and later served as a member of the board of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the technology competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the results of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next such event would take place, as this would give him the opportunity to explore new future designers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the state support they need for their research, Lee said.
"It's not China that's acidifying scientific leaders, it's big companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have also contracted several large university shells over the past few years to work in the MI field.
According to Lee, the change in immigration policy could also greatly help the U.S. efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think you should automatically get a green card for those who have a Ph.D. in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s national natural science foundation provides support to employees of academic institutions in a similar way, as the U.S. National Science Fund (NSF) and other governmental organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers in the core, the subsistence of academic work.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee named Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently spending $100 million a year to support MI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which planned to set up a national security MI committee, has not taken any further steps in the matter for months.
Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name is being held
The people of Macedonia voted in Sunday’s referendum on whether to change the name of the country to “Northern Macedonia”. With this step, a decades-long disagreement with Greece would be resolved, which prevented NATO from joining the EU.
Greece, one of its provinces called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbor indicates that it is in need of the Greek territory of the same name, so it has so far denied the country's NATO and EU membership.
The two governments signed a deal in June on the new name of the state, but nationalist opponents say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the largely Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became questionable whether there will be a 50% turnout rate required for the valid referendum.
The question on the ballots is as follows: ‘Does the country support NATO and EU membership, and does it accept the agreement with Greece?’
Supporters of the name change, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev at the forefront, argue that this price is worth paying in order to give Macedonia, as one of the countries that has risen in the rubble of Yugoslavia, a chance for EU and NATO membership.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country so that Macedonian youth can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough MEPs have stated that they feel they are obliged to vote on the outcome of the vote.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
According to the state election committee, no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m. on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate so far has reached only 16%. This was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ultimately led to 66% of registered voters taking part).
“I came to vote for my children because we have our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica, and their son Dusko, voted in favor of the name change in Strumica, in the September 30, 2018 referendum that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO ties.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for those boycotting the referendum.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we would like to join with a proud, elevated head and not through the exchange window,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can also turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership could be expected to be an investment in Macedonia that the country with more than 20 percent unemployment needs most of the time.
“I think the majority will support our cause, as more than 80% of the country’s population basically supports EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He also added that the “yes” vote “means securing the future of the country”.
According to a poll published last week by the Macedonian political research institute, 30-43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required turnout rate.
According to a survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, the participation rate is expected to be 57% on Sunday.
For those who want to go to vote, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be at least 50% more than one vote.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the West Party government, which came to power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player wins full Brighton defence by scoring goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deeply saddened by Brighton's defence, so Manchester City won 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine batsman received a pass in his midfield as the first step of the attack, and
Between the three Brighton defenders, he stepped out into the open field.
At that time, four green forests surrounded Aguero.
He picked up a defender and then ran for more when he reached Brighton Sixteen.
Then he went to the left for the Sterling who appeared there.
The English batsman gave the ball back to Aguero, who finished the action with his right foot, beating Brighton's goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan's right side.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that you can play for 55, up to 60 minutes.
And so it happened.
Luckily, he scored that goal.”
With Sterling's action, he managed to get the blues on the English Championship rematch.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute, when
Aguero, who lives on the Brightonians, has received a great pass.
He kicked a beautiful crossball towards Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he could have kicked Sterling in the long run.
In the battle of the blues, he could only kick the ball into the gate before sliding out of the base line.
City will play for Hoffenheim in the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday from 12:55.
Scherzer wants to make it harder for the Rockies
Since the Nationals missed the opportunity to enter the postseason, there was no reason for them to really practice.
The always-competitive Scherzer, however, is looking forward to Sunday's race against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponents still have a chance to play. The Rockies have a match advantage ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured at least one spot with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still waiting for them.
“Whether we don’t have a chance anymore, we can stand against them so that in Denver, the mood of the audience and the other team is expected to be at the top of the line for the whole year.
I’m so glad I want to be on this path!”
The Nationals have yet to pick the starter for Sunday, but the news is that in this situation Scherzer will be the thrower.
For Scherzer, who took part in the pitching on Thursday, this will be his 34th starting pitch on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-handed Washington player is 18-7 this season, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 games.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president also covered up the situation around the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done so far is at stake.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big ones, the big ones – I don’t go personally, but I’m basically going, which is why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump said: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing, they can see with their own eyes.
They are really determined, and they are able to use any means to regain power, you can see evil and subjugation.
It doesn't matter who gets hurt, who gets kicked out so they can have control, they can have power, they want control and power, but we don't give up."
According to the president, the Democrats are introducing “resistance and obstruction.”
“They’ve seen all this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and malignant and lazy and lying.”
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on whose hearing he voiced the disapproval of the assembled crowd.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the paperwork?
Uh, what's that?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The Workers' Party no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who are free to say what they think
I was not surprised at all when Momentum activists in my own party decided to support my censorship.
After all, I am only the last in the long line of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
Joan Ryan, my fellow Member of Parliament, has been treated in a similar way, for being disdainfully opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship didn't like the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy, in terms of national security and Europe, which ironically are precisely the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with the previous leaders.
Invitation to the Workers' Party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday said they wanted "a welcoming and productive meeting".
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Today, however, the voice has unfortunately changed, and the promise of a “more restrained, more polite” policy has been forgotten, if it ever happened.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate differing views, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This trend began not long after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. Those of my colleagues with whom I thought our political attitude was similar, have been waiting more and more recently for me to turn my back on his or her personal opinion as his or her own, not his or her own, not his or her own, not his or her own.
After all my public speech – no matter what I have actually said – they begin to gossip on the social sides, they demand my removal, they criticize the politics of the middle class, and they tell me that I shouldn’t even be a member of the Labour Party.
This is not just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are generally restricted to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues, who are forced to face up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of today’s politics is that attacks of this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up on diversity, and with every motive of “distrust” and with every change in the electoral rules, the party is becoming more and more tolerated.
Over the past few years, many have advised me to take myself back, not to be so vocal, and then “everything will be okay.”
That’s not why I took a political career.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, even as a student, because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had so neglected schools that our classroom was almost outdated, and then I fought as a better public room for the most needy as a local councillor and mini-government.
I have never concealed my political views, nor have I done anything else in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was perfectly clear to everyone what political positions I represent and on what topics I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will not only hurt families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to turn so much time and energy into a sign that I am going to use.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise you that I will not let you be distracted or threatened by any political means.
Chris Leslie, Representative of Nottingham East
Ayr–Melrose 38–17: Ayr breaks to the top without a hit
Two late attempts have slightly altered the final result, but there is no doubt about Ayr’s deserved victory in the funniest match of the day, the Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the forefront of the table, the only one of the ten teams to be unbeaten.
Thanks to their unparalleled defense and superior use of the situation, they won, so the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a lot of challenges in our games so far, but we are still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Melrose player Robyn Christie said: “We need to know that Ayr has taken better advantage of his situation than we have.”
With Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt to score a point for Frazier Climo, Ayr was in favour of the match. Thanks to the yellow card from the Warriors to Captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors borrowed from the Scottish captain, Melrose couldn't have made the difference.
Climo slammed Ayr's defense with a penalty, right at the halfway point, then scored a point from a single-person experiment, so the first half ended with a score of 17-5 in favor of Ayr.
Melrose began a strong second half, with Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Baggot, reducing the team's downside by five points.
The game lasted for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to take him off the track, and in the sequel Ayr further increased his advantage by attempting Stafford McDowall, whose babbling he managed to defeat with the help of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, the captain of Ayr, also received a yellow card, and Melrose was able to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment in human form, thereby breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to bounce again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dismantling Climot without a ball, MacPherson showed a touch down from the penalty line behind Ayr's shaking team.
Climo sold what he repeated almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's high shot and sent Gregor Henry's breakup forward for the homes' fifth attempt.
The protagonist of Still Game has started a new career in the hospitality industry
It seems that Ford Kieran, one of the stars of Still Game, is moving towards the hospitality industry: it is clear that he has been led by a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he co-wrote and co-starring with his old comedian friend Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the final season will be the ninth in a row, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, though a source from the Scottish Sun cited Kiernan as trying to profit from Glasgow's "flowering hospitality industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a coastline hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling around the naval commando decorated with sailorship in La Paz.
In public buildings, ocean blue flags float.
The naval bases, from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, have the following motto: “We have a right to the sea.
We have an obligation to recover.”
In Bolivia, where there is no coastline, the memories of the lost coast, which Chile lost in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, are still alive, and there is a strong desire to re-suspend the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps now gained the most strength in decades, as Bolivia awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice in October, which will conclude a five-year consultation.
“Bolivia has the ball that fills people with the spirit of cohesiveness and peace who are in a positive mood for final development,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are monitoring the International Court of Justice’s decision, hoping that the Hague Court of Justice will stand by Bolivia, and that Chile will be obliged to sit at the negotiating table for decades after a rapsodic attitude. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous president – who faces a conflicting struggle to continue for next year’s re-election – could lose a lot with Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favor of Bolivia, and that would not change much in the situation if its decision were still favourable for Bolivia.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to judge Chilean territories, and has also stated in advance that it will not affect the final outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was born just six months after the closing talks indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert in international law in Chile.
In addition, the past four years have not helped the Bolivian case, but have even withdrawn it.
“The current Bolivian government has turned the issue of seafaring into its own goals,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate explained.
“Because of Morales’s hostile rhetoric, the rest of the Chilean people have lost their goodwill.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue the negotiations at some point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the conclusion that the court decision would have been unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia offered an “extraordinary opportunity for a new chapter in its relations with Chile” and a chance for “both to come out of the close of a 139-year conflict,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, had used the maritime debate to forge a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgement gives us an opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: There is no nuclear deterrence until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke in front of the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises to the leaders of the two rival countries at the summit in Singapore.
The remark was made when it appeared that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had succeeded in resuming heated nuclear talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after the Singapore summit.
According to Ri, “I desire” to believe that the American impediment to the ongoing sanctions and the declaration to end the Korean War will ever be enough to force North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards defamation.
Both Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Phenjan’s commitment to the demolition of arsenal, which he probably sees as the only key to the country’s security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris Fashion Shows, there are huge headgear that will soon appear in the top-class stores as well.
If you want to expand your hat collection, or you want to completely cover the sun, then you don’t have to look anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/summer 2019 collection, which was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats have created a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the fashion designers above have also put their notable works on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with pencils, wide arms, and almost completely swallowed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements, there was a gemstone-decorated Greek dwarf, a magic wand, and even a pineapple, which wasn’t really designed to keep a person’s head warm.
Thom Browne has also produced a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were stitched together in his mouth, and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than of haute couture.
One of them resembled a scuba mask, equipped with pipes and glasses, and the other was painted like a melting oak-cream ice cream.
If you get into these spectacular pieces, then you're in luck.
According to the predictions of style analysts, huge hats may already be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path embossed by “La Bomba”, a 60 cm wide straw straw that has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the unpractical hat conquering the social sites introduced another piece on the outlet: a beach bag made of straw, which is almost the size of the swimsuit model that holds it.
The dark orange raffia bag – decorated with raffia bodysuits and a white leather strap on top – was one of the highlights of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring/summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see huge hats and beach bags in top-class clothing stores next summer. The designer has created an elemental effect that makes it difficult to deny the oversized outfit."
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. With the latest outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed for 2018, which is only further reinforced in sports, the arts, music and other community initiatives and consensuses.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in institutions of this type represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and who strive to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, for higher education, for their chosen careers, and for what position they take as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where there is an opportunity to design and introduce customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove to be popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak a language that you understand, it gets to your head.
But if you speak in his tongue, it will reach to his heart.”
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of this year’s exams show that students from independent schools across the country brought the best results from foreign languages.
68 percent of all students who learn a foreign language have achieved a higher A degree (a result exceeding 85 percent).
Based on data collected from SCIS 74 member schools, 72 percent of students received a degree in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spaniards achieved a degree in Mandarin.
These findings also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland are considered to be essential knowledge of foreign languages, which children and young people will undoubtedly need to know in the future.
Today, languages, as chosen subjects, have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both in independent and other types of schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Vocational Training Commission found that 17 percent of employers found that filling vacancies was a problem due to a lack of language skills.
We can also see from this that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in order for young people to have a successful career.
As more and more workplaces expect knowledge of foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of what career you choose, if you have learned a foreign language, you will gain a lifelong knowledge that has a clear advantage.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to applicants who speak multiple languages.
According to a survey by YouGov – which surveyed 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 – 75% of respondents did not know any foreign language well enough to be able to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by 10% of respondents.
Therefore, it is important to focus on the language teaching of children.
Speaking in several languages, especially in the languages of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children with which, when educated as an adult, they have a better chance of applying for more important jobs.
In Scotland, all schools will be taught different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while more will be teaching languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of paramount importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, you will be able to learn more languages of your choice from independent schools and will be trained by teachers who are experts in their field.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is not difficult to note that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital to a country’s future, and that education should reflect that as well.
As far as modern language skills are concerned, they should be treated as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools offer the opportunity of choice, diversity and quality education to the young people of Scotland.
You have to do it – that’s how it has to be.
John Edward, a Scottish Council of Independent Schools president
LeBron presents in San Diego with the Lakers on Sunday
Fans who sit on needles don’t have to wait long to see LeBron James enter the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you will spend on the track is still questionable.
“More than one, and less than 48,” Walton wrote on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the preseason.
“At this point in my career I don’t have to play in the pre-season to be ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump is starting a long line of campaigning events in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This will be Trump’s first of five polled events next week, including stops such as the Tennessee and Mississippi that support him.
Now that a vote has been postponed to confirm his candidate for the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to rally supporters for the next midterm elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose their power in the near future.
When will Trump’s West Virginia event begin tonight, and where can it be followed online?
Trump’s speech in Wheeling (West Virginia) will begin tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 o’clock Eastern Time.
You can also watch Trump’s West Virginia meeting online via YouTube live stream.
Trump is likely to be affected by this week’s hearing by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has proved particularly tense in light of allegations of sexual harassment, and the Senate’s confirmation vote has been suspended for up to a week.
However, the primary purpose of the sudden-growing events is to help the situation of the Republicans before the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser said next week’s five events will serve to “activate voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
"To be able to control Congress in his hands is such a critical point for his political plans that the president visits as many states as possible. We are looking forward to a period of intense campaigning," a spokesperson told Reuters.
The event, scheduled to take place in Wesbanco Arena tonight, “Can bring supporters from the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and even get involved in media coverage in Pittsburgh,” West Virginia Metro News reports.
It will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who polls say is not in a favourable position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should intervene in person to play a better role in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team struggles with full shoulder width ahead of Sunday’s individual to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup was in great need of four games.
Luck and momentum are the driving force behind a sporting concept that is quite breathtaking, yet every player believes in it, especially in races such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have only four points, so we can say we have the ball right here," Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe still leads by four points, and there are twelve more.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they have finally been given a little backwind, and they can draw encouragement from many things, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved unmistakable from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
<0xC3><0x96>blös's victory cries grew louder as he progressed with the round, with a critical slump paid and balanced in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were at a double disadvantage after the two.
The decisive twist of the match resulted in a shout of joy similar to the 15th hole, a kind that can convince the viewer that not everything has been lost for the American team.
“You just have to dig deep into yourself and just take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s exactly what the players are waiting for.
18 holes for the chance to leave a trace of yourself.
In the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup’s most popular pair, have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's odd but loving couple brought four out of four, and they don't seem to be able to make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to perform above the pair on Saturday afternoons and on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and Friday mornings to perform similarly.
Thanks to the dynamics of this series and between them and the audience who support them, they became the benchmark on Sunday, and no one expects them to secure Europe’s victory on the Le Golf National track with the rest of the Sun, like Fleetwood or Molina.
It would be best to win one at a time, at different holes.
However, it would be too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly executed Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning, playing alongside Alex Noren.
Once and twice, the Spaniards and Swedes made the first nine holes in the pair, beating them in a wave valley from which they had no chance of climbing.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball games and four-match games are extremely entertaining thanks to the interactions of the pairs. You can watch who gives you advice, what you don’t give, and how you can change your strategy at a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and it starts with a significant advantage for him on the last day, but this fourth section has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, although many of them are lacking, mainly from the American side.
Europe kicks off the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a well-being advantage after the Saturday four-ball and four-ball games were closed with a 10-6 result against the United States.
The twins Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the hair, winning two victories against the underdog Tiger Woods, raising the difference by four points on the Le Golf National track.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team – which is trying to regain the trophies lost to Hazeltine two years ago – dominated the American team in the morning’s four-ball game, winning the series 3-1.
America saw greater resistance in the quarterfinals, bringing in two matches, but they were not able to make the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should earn eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a series, while he and Molinari – referred to only as “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After beating the Woods–Patrick Reed pair in the four-ball game, they beat the unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau to a definite 5&4.
Woods, who has drawn himself in two matches on Saturday, has sometimes still felt his talent, but has lost 19 out of 29 of the four-ball and four-ball games, seven of which in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning quarterfinals, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, and was defeated 2&1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third-placed pair in the world rankings.
However, not all of Europe has succeeded in this pleasant, windy day, south-west of Paris.
The three-time defender Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it with two points on Saturday.
A silent 2&1 win against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the quarterfinals after losing their first two leagues.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team only managed to come back from a four-point draw in individual competitions twice, although Furyk's defending team was determined enough to retain the trophy.
However, after only being the second best for two days, a Sunday counterattack seems rather unrealistic.
North Korea’s unilateral resignation if it does not trust its negotiator
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions had only increased the perceived distrust of the United States and ruled out that the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the World Organization’s Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken “significant and broad-based steps” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, shutting down its use of nuclear weapons and its use of nuclear weapons, and not promising to do so.
“Unfortunately, we don’t see similar responses from Americans,” he said.
“In the absence of confidence in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally and first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s disappointment over Washington’s resistance to the idea of a “stage” nuclear decommissioning, which North Korea said would receive rewards for the actions it had taken so far, Phyris’ statement did not make any difference.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a US president and a North Korean leader to be held in Singapore on June 12, during which Trump’s letter of resignation was delivered.
North Korea is seeking to formally make a point at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States is of the opinion that Phenyan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has not been allowed to impose any stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament and increases the pressure by sanctions to force its will on us, and protests against who can declare the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that we can be forced to our knees by sanctions is the desire of those who don’t know us.
The problem is that non-relieving sanctions only increase our suspicions.”
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump would be planned, which the U.S. president spoke about separately at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed that there have been three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun-jin over the past five months, and then added: “If the country involved in the nuclear devastation would not have been South Korea, and not the United States would not have had access to North Korea.”
Despite this, Ri’s speech differed dramatically from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the “evil president,” described Kim as a “missile man.”
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards degradation, but also noted that he still has a lot of work to do and if he doesn’t have a lot of work to do, sanctions will be imposed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time limit, meaning "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the efforts he has made so far.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be complied with impeccably until we have reached the actual, final, proven nuclear state.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously upheld sanctions against North Korea in order to curtail the funding of Phenyan’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with R<0xC3><0xAD>bel during the break of the UN General Assembly, and then announced that he would travel to Phenjan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not very successful.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but hours later, North Korea accused him of making “gentle-like demands.”
North Korea has pledged to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility as part of a meeting with Mun this month, if the United States takes “appropriate steps.”
According to Mun, the “imminent steps” Kim mentioned would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, or steps that could lead to the normalization of relations with Washington.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Harvard Students Are Taught to Rest Enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year has pushed students to more sleep, thus also fighting against the increasingly space-saving mascot culture of caffeine-warmed all-night study.
One academic concluded that the students of the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should take care of themselves.
The course, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard College of Medicine and practices as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He encouraged the students to develop the course by giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning in the past.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I just facing this as a graduate?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised him,” he told the Telegraph.
During the course, which was launched for the first time this year, students will be introduced to the fundamental impact that proper sleep habits have on their study and sports performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard College of Medicine and the university’s director of health care, said the university decided to start the course because the students were found to be extraordinarily restless in seven years.
The one-hour course also includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light on what it means, what it means for you, what it means for you, and what it means for you to do.
In another part, participants are introduced to how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They present a map of the university area with interactive icons, so that participants are encouraged to rethink their daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have a right to this knowledge – as well as a right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which it is considered a performance to be spent one night, continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students leads to increasing problems with insomnia.
Adequate and high-quality sleep is a “secret weapon” for students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain to starve and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So assisted Professor Czeisler in designing the course, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year he first enrolled in one of the professor’s courses at Harvard.
He said that those there who heard opened their eyes and encouraged them to fight for the launch of a university-level training program.
He hopes that as the next step, postgraduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training program before they are placed in the competition sector.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set a warning to bedtime, an alarm clock to wake up, and familiarize themselves with the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily excite them.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomber Steven Gerrard slid his team into a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibroxians tried to gain their first foreign victory after the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second win so far from Gary Holt's team from the first 18 matches of Hebrox, who led the team as manager.
Menga was knocked down seven minutes before half time, and the Rangers' unmotivated team hadn't even come close to the match.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place with this, Livingston clung to third, simply lagging behind the Hibernian due to the goal difference.
In addition, the Rangers may face additional difficulties after the coaster Calum Spence suffered a head injury due to medical care due to an object probably dropped from the guest’s store.
Gerrard also changed eight points on the team that reached the Betfred Cup pre-season with Ayr's debut.
Dead beckoned Livingston with the same 11 men who took a point from the Hearts last week and would have looked happy to see their perfect team suffocate their opponent’s game where it was just for him.
Although the Rangers led the ball in possession, Livingston took more with what he acquired.
They could have scored in the first two minutes, when Menga first kicked Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's door, but the midfielder failed to sell the zipper.
Keaghan Jacobs landed a low free kick with team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only found the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the final third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian grievances.
The Rangers were only able to show the first two half-time shots, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely had trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi’s attempt in the 34th minute was opposed to the course of the match so far, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, just for their hard work.
The Rangers again missed a zipper forced by the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond at the time when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball to Scott Robinson, who perfectly found Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard decided to take a break, replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kentre, and this almost immediately had an impact on the game when he jumped on the extreme Morelos, but Kelly, who had a stunning shape, was blocked in time.
Livingston went on to play exactly the game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett smashed the long balls one by one.
Dead's team could have had a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow could have sidelined from a corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came in as a replacement for the Rangers, tried to fight another eleven when he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson was not able to convince him.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
A detail of our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... the day the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that may have resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a staple of science, and thanks to the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado" featuring strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, it has also become a part of pop culture:
Man: “What is this miracle?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. You can search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on this headphone, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: “Hey, listen, he’s pretty horny now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, he lives on in the invention that bears his name.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to “See” Abnormal Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to “See” and Destroy Abnormal Cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a laboratory.
In this way, they are able to "see" the protein, which is accompanied by many types of cancers. The treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients suffering from various types of cancers.
A woman who has been treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells has been able to say goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of extracting immune cells from the patient; modifying them in the laboratory to “see” the protein called HER2, which is a frequent companion to multiple cancers; and then replanting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the American National Cancer Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 "scanned the growth of multiple types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, which is based on highlighting immune cells and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells, has previously been used successfully in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West’s SNL role in the MAGA hat culminated in a humiliating tirade in support of Trump.
It didn't cook too well
Kanye West was kidnapped at Saturday Night Live after an unrelated demonstration in which he honored U.S. President Donald Trump and then announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in his cover of Make America Great Again, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to someone who is white, they ask the question: ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
“If I were interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
Matt Damon opened the SNL show with a parody in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh made fun of his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment charges.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, the video of West’s speech was uploaded by Chris Rock as a humorist to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with the upload.
West even complained to the audience that they were scrambled behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They were scared behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat."
It's intimidated!
And they said I was in the sinking place,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West went on, “You want to see a submerged place? I’m going to put on my Superman hat because it means they can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try it out with love.”
The demonstrations were accompanied by whistles from the audience at least twice, and SNL’s actors apparently felt embarrassed, according to one eyewitness to Variety: “The whole studio was covered in silent silence.”
West was invited instead of singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose former boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days before.
West raised several questions when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed in a Perrier glass.
West, the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, tweeted: “One of the bravest spirits: WE CHOOSE HOW WE COLLECT THE TIME.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply “self, and that’s great.”
“But I have decided NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or his fashion articles or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe to be an ideology of its own and disseminate that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he is "the creature previously known as Kanye West."
He wasn’t the first artist to change his name, and so did Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His rapper partner, Snoop Dogg, also recorded the name Snoop Lion, and of course the ancient legend, Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Man Accused of Delay in Belfast Restaurant Attempt to Kill
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to a police statement, the case took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are reconsidered by the D.A.
Kit Harington, Star of the Thrones, finds excessive masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow in the Battle of the Thrones, and in the violent fantasy series HBO, he often takes a sword.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke out against stereotypical mascot heroes, stressing that in view of such heroes, little boys may often feel that hard action is needed to fight off respect.
Kit said in a statement to The Sunday Times Culture that he thought “something was wrong” and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of the harmful effects of excessive masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
The star, who recently married also 31-year-old series co-worker Rose Leslie, said he thought it would be very important to cure the problem.
“Personally, I am deeply touched by this matter – how has the portrayal of masculinity been so distorted?” asked the actor.
“What did we teach men in their childhood about the problem we are facing now?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for spreading the distorted image of masculinity, as the shows often feature very masculine characters.
Continuing the thought process, he added: “What is born with us, and what is it that we learn?
What do street and TV tell young boys that they feel they can only be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
Because it's clear that something's wrong with young men."
Kit said in an interview that after the show's summer season's end, it will not be featured in the Battle of the Thrones series or sequels, because "there's plenty of battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, Kit will remake Sam Shepard's film True West, which is about a producer and his life-threatening brother.
The actor told me that the best thing he got from the Battle of the Thrones was his wife, Rose, whom he knew during the making of the series.
“I met my wife on the set, so I can thank the series for my future family and my life ahead of me,” Kit said.
Rose Ygritte, who was in love with Kit's character, Jon Snow in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new patients increased by 14% in China
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
According to health officials, this means more than 820,000 people affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by around 40,000.
Compared to the previous one, this means that a significant majority of newly infected people are sexually transmitted to the disease.
The disease was spread at a rapid rate by transfusion of previously infected blood in parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Jünnan province said that the number of such cases has since dropped to almost zero.
Despite this, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men end up marrying a woman because of the country’s conservative values.
The disease in these relationships spreads in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been providing universal access to HIV medicines as part of a programme to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her staff had leaked data from Republican senators and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that one of her staff had published the personal data of three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
According to the Los Angeles Democratic Representative, the allegations were circulated by “extreme-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more subversive lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the address and phone number of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as the address and phone number of Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was released on Thursday on the Internet. The person of the publication is unknown, but it is certain that they were published from the Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on sexual harassment by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred not long after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, say the source-identified IP address can be linked to Waters' office, and data has also been disclosed about a member of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
“These accusations are completely baseless, false, and obviously false,” Waters said.
– My staff member does not bear any responsibility for leaking information. However, the right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been violated due to fraudulent and false accusations.
These accusations are completely baseless, false, and obviously false.”
Waters' statements were quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“Based on this, Waters doesn’t seem to have the blood pressure required for the office.
If you suspect someone with something they didn’t do, you can’t react to it in anger.
You can't act right.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You need to stay calm and calm.”
Mr. Fleischer's reaction was apparently compared to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to the Democratic Party's criticism, which some critics said seemed too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters as a Republican candidate in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified the “competent authorities and law enforcement agencies” of the false accusations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified,” Waters continued, “and that they are legally held accountable for any act that threatens or harms any member of my staff.”
Johnny English hits again, or Rowan Atkinson cheating spy game
Today it has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British films, and there is no exception to this, but the franchise, which is a Johnny English action game/parody, is a franchise that will be included in the first part of Johnny English in 2011, and the second part of Johnny English in 2003.
Will the British nation become the new export product of sarcastic, self-parodying satires in which we face our own obvious curse?
It is so certain that Johnny English, who was blindfolded, incompetent, had enough ammunition to make another comeback – it is already clear from his name that this comic character was created in order to be seen in the cinemas of the non-English-speaking countries of the world.
Johnny English is, of course, a shoved secret agent, who imagines himself to be gaining momentum with his bizarre mannerism, so he reminds us a little of Inspector Clouseau, occasionally Mr. Bean, and occasionally of the guy who would be able to join me at his 2012 press of a button.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, and who left chaos everywhere behind.
There are a couple of good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotors came there for a few moments knocking on his helmet.
Atkinson's comic veins are well-liked in the film, but the humor of the film doesn't really work, and in fact, it does seem superfluous, as today's "serious"-sounding franchises such as the James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series are bravely tapping into his device of humor.
Feeling that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and for me Johnny English’s fluffy, left-handed adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is perpetuated: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal hacked into the super-secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents to the greatest horror of the vigilante agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got such a small role in the film.
This may be the last corner in the coffin of the self-described and sharing prime minister, whose political popularity is still in ruins: Emma Thompson is practically portraying Theresa May, and taking everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
The intelligence advisers explain to him that, since the identity of all active agents has been revealed, he must appoint a serenaded agent to work.
This retired agent is of course nothing more than a two-handed Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher at an outstanding school since his retirement, but he teaches children to spy, apart from the curriculum – there are, of course, some funny scenes here, while I’m talking about your English-like “Rocksuli”.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he reunites with his long-suffering former gunman, Bough, who is now portrayed by Ben Miller.
Bough has since been married and married to a captain of a submarine, whose mouth is always open to the ears – portrayed by Captain Vicki Pepperdine, who has been called to a much better role than that.
The two-handed pair of Batman and Robin from Her Majesty’s National Security Service is back in action and confronts Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a woman of real destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly being embroiled by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and he is portraying Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their clown mission: a waiter disguised as a puppet fires a French restaurant, then smuggles into Volta's luxury yacht in the midst of an astonishing twist, and English actually frees himself from hell when he uses a Volat-head.
These stations are needed in order to get to the final stage of development, but no matter how happy and twisting it is, it may be a bit too much of an impression of a children's movie.
The end result is pretty mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English films, the question has now come to my mind: Can the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
British Workers' Party denies introducing four-day work week while paying the British for five-day work
Jeremy Corbyn's Workers' Party is working on a radical plan: to introduce his four-day job. All this in a way that employees would work for a five-day salary.
The party is said to want workers to benefit from the benefits of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, so that corporate executives can provide employees with an extra day off thanks to increased revenues.
According to the plan, workers would be given a three-day weekend while bringing home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea would “fit” into the party’s economic program, which aims to tap the workers’ side in the language of the balance in the country.
The idea of the four-day job is also supported by the Trade Union Congress, which believes that workers can also benefit from the changing economy.
One of the Labour Party’s top officials told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to the next, but its four-day work is an idea that fits well into the party’s program that would push the language of the scales towards the workers in the economy, and also fits into the party’s comprehensive industrial strategy.”
The Workers’ Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has already campaigned for its four-day work in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: “The four-day work schedule is not part of the policies supported by the party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at a Labour Party conference last week.
McDonnell has said he is desperately fighting to regain power from the “unarmed directors” and the “beneficiaries” of the regime.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water companies would not get back the full profits of them, because a Labour government would provide “deductions” as punishment for the alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell has also confirmed that he plans to make employees a member of the board of directors and create Inclusive Ownership Funds that can allocate 10% of the private sector companies’ shares to employees who are able to raise <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have revealed in the show "60 Minutes" that the FBI's crackdown on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
As a result of the FBI's pressure to investigate the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, at least a week later, Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court will be held as a final vote on whether he will be elected to the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to think about.
Kennedy seemed to be less committed than his South Carolina counterparts.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that before the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called for the case to erupt, after the charges were made, and I asked, "Did you?"
The answer was clear and clear.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems to be concrete.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take extremely serious charges to think about myself,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know that Brett strongly denied the claims,” Graham said in a statement to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people named by Dr. Ford have substantiated the accusations.
This is a 36-year story.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the Global Citizens’ Festival, and has it managed to mitigate poverty?
On Saturday, the annual music event, the Global Citizens Festival, will begin in New York City. World stars will perform at the festival to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival is now being held for the seventh time, and is expected to be held on tens of thousands of Central Park Great Easter, where participants can enjoy not only the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the actual purpose of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival was first organized in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by engaging more people in the fight against poverty.
You can get a free ticket to the concert (unless you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket) to perform certain tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a leading politician to attend a project, a phone call, or anything else.
But how successful has the Global Citizen really been in achieving the goals set in the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with a concert ticket to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clickivism” when people feel like they’ve actually contributed to a Twitter thing or a tweet about it?
Since 2011, according to the Global Citizen data, more than 19 million “actions” have been carried out by project sponsors who have served a number of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to the allocation of $37 billion by world leaders to anti-poverty policies and commitments that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and notifications that their actions stem from, of which $10 billion has already been paid out or collected during the fundraising process.
According to the group’s estimates, the money raised had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors, which aims to “help children reach their potential as much as they do”.The organization has pledged to deliver $35 million to Ruanda for her.
“With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put social injustices and malnutrition in the footnotes of history books,” said Dr. Tracey Ullman.
The group also claims that after asking the UK for more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has allocated resources for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizens website is, “Why do you think that poverty can be eradicated?”
According to the Global Citizen’s response: “There will be a long and difficult road that sometimes leads to failure and sometimes to failure.
But like the previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we will achieve our goal because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e will perform at this year’s event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: U.S. Navy to Apply ‘Blockade’ to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
“If necessary,” Washington would even deploy the navy to stop Russian energy carriers from entering the market, and Russian energy, for example, would not be able to reach the Middle East, said U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
According to Zinke, Russia’s active presence in Syria – especially regarding Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government – is only an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets for itself.
“I think they’re only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Interior Minister, there are ways to prevent the Russians.
“The U.S. is able to ensure that the naval routes are open, and it can block them if necessary, so it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the participants of a nonprofit event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the nonprofit group, by the way, defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington’s actions against Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be economically sanctioned in much the same way: using existing energy carriers and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy”, pointing to the country’s fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby removing Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That’s why the Trump administration’s top officials, including the president himself, are winning Germany to back down behind the so-called “impotent” pipeline project Northern Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Moscow a “neutral” Germany.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the project, which doubles its existing capacity and raises it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project for the 11 billion-dollar Northern Stream.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so fiercely opposed to the project, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
“I suppose we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure, and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak told U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The attempt to convince the Americans has gone backwards, as Germany has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy, as well as refrain from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third country intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Dieter Kempf, the president of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after the last meeting of Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is 'seriously considering leaving for the presidency in 2020'
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was “seriously considering” going for the presidency after the midterm elections.
Warren, in Massachusetts, at a city meeting in Hollyoke, confirmed that he was considering leaving.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and restore a malfunctioning government, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I am seriously considering taking up the presidency.”
At the city's meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said he thought he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction."
“I am paying close attention to what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren has outspokenly criticized Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “So of course there is a need for FBI pressure before the vote.”
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, a majority of Warren’s Massachusetts voters do not think Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Center for Political Analysis and the Boston Globe survey, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren "with a good chance" say the senator should not run for president until the end of his term.
32% support Warren's candidacy.
According to the survey, Deval Patrick’s former presidential nomination would be supported by the majority of respondents, 38% and 48% against.
In the 2020 presidential election, among other things, the name of such high-ranking Democratic politicians as former Vice President Joe Biden or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has emerged.
According to an Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to start by January.
Sarah Palin Track Referred to Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump Meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for one year after signing up in September
On Monday night, he was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through since coming home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD, and the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” said Sarah Palin, a senior officer in the US military.
Palin's son called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that his son, like other war veterans, "changed, hardened, and continued to walk in his head for the sake of all his troops, and whether his fellow members deserve the service, the service."
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla police, said that Track Palin, according to a report, was also carrying a gun and drinking inside his family.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support judicial review of asylum policy
Eighteen states and Washington D.C. also support a judicial review of the new U.S. asylum policy, under which those who are fleeing violence by gangs or in-family cannot take refuge.
Representatives from 18 different states and Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who is attacking the policy in court, NBC News writes.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions case initiated by the U.S. Civil Rights Union against federal policy in August has not been made public.
The woman claims that her partner and "sons of her violent crime" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
Prosecutors of the Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many of the asylum claims filed against the United States come from, as these countries are a continuing problem for criminal gangs and fraudsters.
The new U.S. refugee policy has revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) that allows immigrants who do not have family documents to seek refuge from domestic violence.
Attorney General Karl Racine of Washington, D.C., said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be judged according to the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter said.
The prosecutors also said in the letter that the policy of rejecting immigration is detrimental to the U.S. economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill in the lowest-level jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum-seeking judges not to grant asylum rights to victims of domestic violence and fugitives from crime gangs.
“The right of asylum is a person who leaves his country for racial, religious reasons, national renunciation, persecution for a particular social group, or political conviction, or for a justified fear of persecution,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has not been designed to solve all the problems of people around the world, every day – no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of dead doubled, the rescue units run a race with time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more optimistic.
“Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while reassuring her feverish baby boy at one of Palu’s evacuation centres.
The rescuers bring in the bodies every minute.
We have hardly any drinking water.”
Some of the residents returned to their destroyed home to rescue them from the wreckage, which can still be saved.
Hundreds have been injured, and the hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are not able to provide people.
Some of the injured, including the broken back and shoulder Dwi Harist, were transported to the Palui Military Hospital, where the patients were seen outside the hospital building due to high-strength follow-up.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears as he recalled how the fifth-floor hotel room, where his wife and daughter were occupied, was shaken into the destructive upliftment.
“There was no time to escape.
“I think I’m stuck in the broken walls,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife yelling for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of smuggling the country with propaganda
The U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press, a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper that lent the U.S.-China trade relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited an advertisement in the China Daily Des Moines Register – Iowa’s largest-selling newspaper – while accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump accuses Beijing of trying to intervene in the U.S. election, some U.S. officials told Reuters that it would be a new phase in Washington’s increasingly toughening action against China aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertisements, there is an increasingly intense trade war between Beijing and Washington, in which they impose new and new tariffs on each other’s import products.
U.S. and Chinese experts say the tariffs imposed by the Chinese in response to the trade war were aimed at exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including in Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, has said that Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses, as the state of Iowa exports a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that "China is further invading our country by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the highly valued American tradition of freedom of speech and the press by spreading propaganda in paid ads placed in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, if we go to a newspaper in Beijing, we hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all faithfully reflect the different, different opinions of the Chinese people on the growing prospects of the Chinese economy.” The Chinese media said in a statement.
Branstad added that "one of China's most expensive newspapers was unwilling to take down" his article, but he did not name it.
Analysts say Republicans may alienate women’s voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh scandal
Analysts say that many high-ranking Republican politicians are defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the crossfire of sexual harassment charges. This could lead to the loss of support from women voters in particular.
The case sparked intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be resuscitated, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, in a Saturday article at The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute FBI pressure put forward by Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake would be enough to reassure the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — not tomorrow, not in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told a Washington, D.C., newspaper.
Mic reported that on Friday morning, some protesters in the Senate corridor chanted, “November is approaching!” as the Republican-controlled Justice Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement.
“Amazingly, there will be a leap of democratic enthusiasm and motivation,” independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg said in a statement.
“A lot of people say it’s been huge so far, and that’s true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the uncertain women voters in the suburbs and young people (18-29 years old) who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not go to vote."
Analysts have already assumed that he could retaliate against the Republicans if they continue to stand for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, and Ford has since described in detail why he accuses him of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was on the wrong ground,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about how the Republicans handled the case and how they behaved with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, the Democratic presidential candidate.
It seems, however, that the Americans are quite divided in whether Ford or Kavanaugh's confession is true. Kavanaugh is believed by a little more than Ford.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believed Ford’s statement completely or rather, and 35% of respondents gave the same answer at Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably or surely lied in his confession, while only 30% of respondents believed this about Ford.
Under Flake’s motion, the FBI is currently investigating the credibility of Ford’s claims, as are the claims of another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh.
A week ago, Ford swore to the Senate Judiciary Committee that at the age of 17, Kavanaugh had drunkenly harassed him.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitalia in a bully in the 1980s, when both of them studied at Yale.
Inventor of the World Wide Web Launches New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solidra.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access the individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “the acquisition of sovereignty over the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data repository”, also known as POD.
This can include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available from the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who has access to their data.
The company calls this “the exercise of the right of self-determination of persons over personal data”.
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, said the company’s mission is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the contract developers involved in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt page.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team are not asking Facebook and Google to introduce a technology that will bring about a complete change that will bring the company’s business models to the top from day to day.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post published on Media on Saturday that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solidra.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important opinion maker in debates about internet neutrality.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the global network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann Celebrates Victory-Cross in the First World War
The only Anglican to receive the Victorian Cross celebrates his hometown 100 years after his heroic performance in the First World War.
Bernard Vann, the Honourable and Colonel, was awarded the Medal of Honor in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he could never know that he had earned the highest honour of the British Armed Forces.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “symbolic” that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning act.
According to the London Gazette, Bernard Vann, the Honourable, and Lieutenant Colonel, on 29 September 1918, crossed the Canal de Saint-Quentin in the midst of a "dense fog and heavy cannon and machine gun fire".
He later rushed into the faceline and stood at the top of the flag line with "exceptional heroism", then himself slammed a field cannon squadron, injuring three of its members.
Bernard Vann was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never reach out to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility,” Vann, 72, said in a statement.
After a performance by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also carved the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said he felt honored to have played a role in the celebration and added: "The litigation of a true hero is evidenced by how many express their respects later on."
MMA volunteers streamed all night to watch the broadcast of Bellator 206 instead of getting a Peppa pig
Imagine that you've been running all night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, and that's what's missing.
The San José show featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live at night in the UK as part of the main competition show, Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the English spectators were not surprised by Peppa Pig instead of the match.
This was discredited by many, who were left up to the early hours of the morning because of the clash.
Instead of the MMA game, the children's cartoon was titled "some kind of sick joke" by one of the fans on Twitter.
“Under state regulations, such content can no longer be broadcast on the channel at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator’s communications and marketing department.
“Yes, it’s Peppa, the pig’s time.”
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, has promised that in the future the schedule of the show will be revised to include viewers in the UK.
“I think we can do it again and again,” Coker said.
“But since it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, until Sunday, which is already Monday, we can’t fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show was switched on, there were a lot of messages, and so most of them weren't really friendly.
At first, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the error.
This was not the case, but a legal issue.
However, I can promise you that next time something like this will not happen.
Instead of the previous six, there will only be five games in the program – we would have liked to have liked the spectators, but we have counted ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Fights Minority Complex for Sexual Attitude
Tom Daley said at the Olympic Games that he felt inferior to everyone at a young age because of his sexual orientation, but he was motivated by this to be successful.
According to the 24-year-old, he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like him.”
In his radio show, Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told broadcaster Lauren Laverne that he stands out for the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the show’s permanent director, spent many years on the show, missing out on several months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" when he was young than anyone else because "it was not socially accepted when someone loved boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and otherness is what gives me perseverance and strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he also deserves “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when it comes to his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community, and taking advantage of his participation in this year’s international community games in Australia, he has asked governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke about the matter because he felt lucky to be able to live his life openly, without negative consequences, and would have liked to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was “completely surprised” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker he met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and her 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter got married last year, and she said the age difference was never a problem.
“If you go through so much at a young age,” he said, when he was 14 years old at his first Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it would be hard to find someone in his own age group who had similarly extreme experiences.
In June, the couple adopted a young boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, according to Daley, completely turned his attitude towards the world.
“If they asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold coin,” he said.
“But you know what I came to realize? There are more important things than my Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal, Robbie."
The child's name was named after Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
According to Daley’s statement, his father did not want to accept that he would die, and one of the last questions was whether he had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t answer him, ‘Dad, you won’t be in the front row any more,’” he said.
“I held his hand when his breathing stopped, but until now I couldn’t accept that my father wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt like this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
Heather Small Proud (Büszke) helped her a lot in the preparation of the Olympics, and will still be skinny to this day if she hears it.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 local time.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was kidnapped on the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
U.S. Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in the 47th Cup match at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must regain his form if he doesn’t want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays for the 12th time on the record at the event held every two years, but due to his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-match matches, team captain Jim Furyk sent him to the podium.
Instead of having five wins in the big tournaments, a player who would be at the center of the events as often as he had to fight for the victory of the United States, now in one half of the day he will surprise his team, spend the other half of his time practicing in the game.
At the peak of his career, he was never among the most accurate strikers, so the 48-year-old does not really have a narrow track at Le Golf National, where due to the high grass, a very high price has to be paid for faulty strikes.
And if the track itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson is faced in Sunday’s ninth game by the English champion Francesco Molinari, who has won all four games this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans start strong with a four-point draw before the 12 individual matches, then Mickelson’s game can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else could he say?
“He’s fully aware of his role in today’s development. He shook my back, crossed my leg and promised he’d be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
- She's very confident.
He is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and in the past week.
I didn't mean two games for him.
I planned more, but in that situation, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson’s Sunday appearance will break Nick Faldo’s record as no one has played more games in the Ryder Cup.
This allows you to close a series on the Ryder Cup that is far from the player’s individual performance.
Mickelson may have 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven innings, but Furyk emphasized that the veteran's presence does not have tangible benefits for the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to joke with others, he’s a great team member,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the games they played against him, and it’s good to see that.
His presence is beyond the game in the strict sense.”
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their acquired advantage
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the European team, knows that even if someone gets a significant advantage for the last day of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn his back on his luck.
The Danish player made his debut in a 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros won a five-point lead against the Americans, and in the end they managed to keep only a hairpin lead to the 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 ratio.
“We always have to remind ourselves that we won a great advantage in Valderram<0xC3><0xA1>n, but we only won with one hairpin, and we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got it out,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said in the picture on the golf course at the Golf-Lezl<0xC3><0xB3>n 10 in the 2018 class, 5–3 in the gymnasium.
“We’ve been thinking about the races of the past few years and now everyone can see that the game is not over yet.
You have to play with full force tomorrow.
So let's go and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal that is nothing more than to win this trophy, and that's all we need to focus on right now.
As I said before, I’m mostly concerned with the 12 players on our team, but we have to pay attention to the other side, which, incidentally, is one of the biggest players in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is proud of the team’s performance on the difficult track, adding: “I would never give up on your predictions in a situation like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different pasta.
Then everything depends on the individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It’s a great feeling to play in a couple when things go well, but when one stands out individually, it turns out in every respect what a golfer really is.
It is important to understand with the players that tomorrow they will bring out the best of themselves on the pitch.
They have to break up with their partner, who will also have to bring in the best form.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team, is strongly confident that his players perform better individually than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last day's resurrections: Brookline was a member of the winning team, and then stood on the losing side after the European team's "miracle of Medina" performance.
“I remember every goddamn word,” he said when asked as he encouraged the players before the last day of team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we’re going to have the best start at Brookline, as we’ve seen at Medinah.
If one team is really under pressure, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent’s players in the middle of the game.
"We have put together the order accordingly and have prepared our players so that they can perform a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of leading the efforts to reverse the job, and Rory McIlroy plays in the first match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I also decided to go for the order because I think that’s how the picture works from beginning to end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added to the individual setup.
The transfer of Germany's newest warship has been postponed.
The latest frigate of the German Navy was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this is still waiting for itself for next year.
The flagship of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the "Rheinland-Pfalz" was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the navy in 2014, but the ongoing delays have made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to replace the Bremen-class frigates.
We know that it will have a large firearm and will be equipped with various anti-aircraft and aquatic missiles and camouflage technology, including a signal suppressor that reduces the ship’s radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that there is less maintenance needed, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from the mother ports.
However, due to the continuous sliding of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel power overseas, may already be outdated when they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The heavy-duty F125 frigate was put on the cover last year when the German Navy officially refused to give up the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent back a landing ship to the manufacturer.
Not much information about the reasons for the return has come to light, but the German media mentions several critical "software and hardware errors" that render the warship useless for a combat deployment.
The software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will be served on the Baden-Württemberg-class warships, which is only half of the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also apparent that the ship was extremely overweight, which impaired its performance and made it impossible for the Navy to make further modifications later on.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as the Germans ordered similar class ships in World War II.
With the exception of faulty components, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is an increasing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial project amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the warnings that Germany’s maritime presence is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s national defence committee, recently acknowledged that the navy was “starting to run out of acceptable warships.”
According to the official, the problem has become a self-intimidating process in the meantime, as the old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships with which the gaps could be replaced.
He expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of seafarers
A new research is underway on a Scottish terrestrial estate, with the aim of discovering how seafarers use the features of the landscape while hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single-flying mammals, which may also be useful for later breed conservation initiatives.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will examine the behavior of common and soprano dwarfs, as well as brown long-headed dwarfs and aquatic dwarfs at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed at the appropriate points in the area so that the activities of the seafarers can be recorded during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will be collecting mobile data with handheld detectors.
By analyzing the volume of the recordings in detail, you can determine the frequency of the fish sounds and what kind of species they are doing.
The researchers will also create a habitat map and report, which will help to determine in detail how the behavior of the animals develops depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important for marine mammals and how they are used.
This information will help to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the formation of reefs, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
In the territory of Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of pig populations has decreased significantly over the past century.
Construction and land-development work disrupts the dormitories of animals and reduces their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are some of the chemical procedures used in the building materials used in air-conditioning, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Fleas aren't really completely blind.
However, as night predators, they rely more on their hearing when they hunt prey than on their vision.
With their sophisticated ultrasound-reflecting technique, they can determine the exact position of insects and terrain objects in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the question of mariners very seriously.
They work with ten qualified specialists, who regularly conduct studies and sleep checks, and occasionally participate in rescue work as well.
The organization established Scotland's first and only dedicated marine reserve on Thrave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten marine species.
According to property manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for seafarers.
“There’s a great place for the bats in Thraave,” he said.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But we don’t know a lot about the seafarers yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great.”
He also stressed how important it is to make sure that fishers live there before renovating the buildings, as the destruction of a single settlement could result in the destruction of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Marines are prohibited by law from protecting animals, their destruction, their harassment and their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for the help of the public.
“There’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, and we have hardly any information about the situation of the population of most domestic species,” he said.
Ronaldo denies accusations of sexual violence, lawyers start litigation against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of "fake news" about sexual violence against him, saying others want to use his name to "enter the public consciousness".
The footballer's lawyers are ready to sue the indicting German weekly newspaper Der Spiegel.
A member of the Portuguese frame and Juventus battalion were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375,000 to listen to the case, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
33-year-old Ronaldo announced in an Instagram Live video a few hours after the allegations came to light that the news was “a lie.”
“No, no, no, no and no.
“What they’ve been saying about me today is all a lie,” the five-time gold ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into the public consciousness.
It's like that.
They want to be famous by my name, that's the life of the actors.
I’m a happy person and I’m fine with my life,” he added with a smile.
Due to the allegations, which have been called an "unacceptable, privacy-infringing suspicion," Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to infiltrate Der Spiegel.
According to a statement by attorney Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for damages "to a degree consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights committed in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in one of the suites of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the sportsman's suite, where the man had anal raped a woman, according to documents filed with the District Attorney's Office in Clark County, Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo knelt on his knees after the incident and told him that he was “99 percent good boy,” except for “one percent.”
Based on the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having had sexual relations with the woman, but said all of this was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and made a statement in a hospital about his injuries, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because he was “afraid of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman now wants to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the case continues to exacerbate her life.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of a rematch (from Real Madrid to Manchester United), and this summer Italy’s giant Juve bought the player for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: the UK will "forever regret" the loss of car factories
The UK will “forever regret” if it loses its position as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added: “Toyota UK is concerned about the BBC’s statement that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the car factory will be forced to temporarily stop production at the Burnastone plant near Derby.
“There’s a tough deal,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jobs could be cut due to delays at the borders.
Last year, the Toyota Auris and Avensis factory in Burnaston produced 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“I see that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burnastone.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, also expressed concern about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, said it would close its factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned that a no-deal Brexit poses risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal.
Toyota’s production line is based on “just in time,” with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU member states.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, disruptions at the borders could lead to production delays and a lack of components, according to industry representatives.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough parts for more than one day at its plant in Derbyshire, so production should be stopped.
Clark said the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was “precisely formulated to avoid border checks causing delays.”
“We have the capacity to reach an agreement, and we want the best possible terms and conditions to not only enjoy the fruits of our current successes, but also offer new opportunities,” he said in a statement on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our highly successful supply chain at the moment.”
Toyota was unable to tell how long the production would last, but warned that the cumulative costs could deteriorate the factory’s competitiveness in the long run, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is currently working for the union Unite, the union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, we will never get back jobs that end at that time.”
A government spokesperson said: "We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be postponed, the White House said.
"Another week may be postponed," Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's high-profile meeting could be postponed as the debate over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian influence on the election, possible relations between Trump advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months, Washington has been speculating on whether Trump will finally oust the deputy attorney general, endangering Mueller’s independence.
According to a New York Times report this month, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting fraudulently in order to record a conversation with the president, and the question was also raised whether it would be possible to replace Trump under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied what he said.
On Monday, however, he visited the White House, and there was a speech to present his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in front of the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "not like to" manage Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and her suspect woman, Dr. Christine For Blase, were also sexually assaulted.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI crackdown to investigate charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump’s secretary of press, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: “We don’t have a designated date for now, and even this week we can highlight, but I see a chance of another one-week delay in the Supreme Court case.
It will soon be revealed, and I will, as always, notify the press."
Some journalists, however, doubtfully accepted the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Show host Chris Wallace also asked about the reason for this.
Sanders replied that the rarity of press conferences was not due to his disapproval of television reporters’ “sensational bias” behavior, but added: “I don’t dispute the fact that I really am a sensationalist.”
Thereafter, he pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and the press representatives would be held more often.
"The president gives more question-and-answer interviews than any previous president," he said, adding that without substantiating the claim: "We've looked at the numbers."
Sanders said: “If the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, the light years are better than if they talk to me.
We often try to get in line with this, and in the last few weeks there have been a number of such occasions, so instead of the White House press conferences, they can speak to the President of the United States in person.”
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when he leaves the White House, or attends public events, or perhaps press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
The press conferences held alone, however, are quite rare.
Why, perhaps, we can conclude from what happened this week, when the president in New York produced an unusual and occasionally bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the health fund addressed in a letter to NHS Scotland's European Union employees over concerns about Brexit
The head of the health fund said in a letter of gratitude to the country’s employees of the Scottish NHS from the European Union countries, and that he hoped they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's expected exit.
The Scottish government has already agreed to cover the costs of EU citizens who work in the decentralised public service in connection with their applications for legal status.
In his letter, Freeman said: “This summer, negotiations on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and the European Union have continued, as a result of which a decision is expected to be made in the autumn.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also added to the preparation of a possible non-agreement scenario.
I am aware of what an alarming period this may be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, no matter what country they come from.
Employees from different EU Member States and other countries have valuable experience and expertise to support the work of the health portfolio, which also has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before midday.
“He walked out to the coastline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaching team and medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the track, then put it on a sledgehammer and took it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie was beyond the surgery performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he "can't know more details about the type and extent of the injury" while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a year-long second-year student, spends his first season with the Tennessee State team, where he passed from Illinois.
He presented a total of five successful installations on Saturday before he left the track, so he is already in the season at 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for properties purchased in the United Kingdom.
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for properties purchased in the UK and support the homeless with the extra income from it.
With this step, I would neutralize Corbyn’s success among young voters
The increase of the tax is aimed at those who do not tax in the UK
The State Treasury estimates that this would mean <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in annual revenues, which it would spend to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for properties purchased in the UK, and the resulting surplus revenue will be spent in support of the homeless, Theresa May is about to announce at a press conference today.
The goal of the move is likely to offset the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which he has achieved by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in the tax will affect individuals and companies who do not tax in the UK, and the excess revenues resulting from this will be used to combat homelessness.
The surcharge added to the current tax, which can be charged up to three per cent in excess of the higher tax imposed on the second apartments or properties purchased for the purpose of spending two years ago.
The state treasury is expected to receive <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK nationals, resulting in a significant price increase, which is becoming increasingly difficult for first-time home buyers.
Many of the country's rich districts have become "spirit cities", especially in the capital, as there are many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in fees, which could help young people who are preparing to wait for their first home.
He personally considers large construction companies to be responsible for keeping property prices high, which have become the habit of buying up the land and leaving the parlament. He asked Mayt to erase the quotas allocated to affordable houses and to start "shameful things in the country".
Corbyn has put forward some notable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including housing control and the abolition of unfounded evictions.
In addition, it will provide more powers and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my Prime Ministership to the restoration of the English dream and to making life better for every generation.
To do this, the real estate market situation needs to be settled.
Britannia continues, as always, to be open to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right that individuals living outside the country, as well as companies of foreign interest, should be able to buy property just as easily as hard-working British citizens.
Dreams woven from one’s own home have become almost unattainable for many, and the state of homelessness has become too accessible.”
Jack Ross: "I really want to be the manager of the Scottish team"
According to Sunderland coach Jack Ross, his “most desire” is to become a manager of the Scottish national team once.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take on the challenges of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first-class league, with only three points short of first place.
He then transferred his seat to the Stadium of Light, after successfully returning St. Mirren's team to the first-class Scottish football championship in the previous season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
“Unfortunately, I only managed to get into the backups,” Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampden with my dad, and something always came back to them.
But now I only have a chance to succeed as a club manager.”
The Sunderland managerial post includes the predecessors of Ross, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach is not worried about having to step in the footsteps of such big names, and has previously rejected the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, I’m going to measure whether I can get the team back into the first class.
“If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly his place in the first-class league,” he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back, but it’s more than likely that I will only be able to consider my activities here if I manage to get the club back.”
Ross's managerial career began just three years ago after working as a substitute coach for the Dumbarton team and spending 15 months in the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Aolla to stand back after the team relegated to the third division and won the championship title with St. Mirren, who was on the edge of the finish the following season.
Ross says he feels much more confident now than ever in his playing career, either at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real defining moment,” he recalled his time as Alloa’s coach.
“I clearly thought that managering was more for me than being a player.
That sounds strange, because I did well, my life quite well, and in fact, I had some really memorable moments.
However, sometimes the lives of players are very hard.
Lots of things to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to cope with the stress and pressure of the job, but the management tasks lie with me.
I’ve always been interested in management, and now that I’ve tasted it, I feel the best in my skin as an adult.”
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September, from 12:00 to 13:00 local time on Radio Scotland.
According to a study, beer falls best on Saturday afternoon at 5:30 p.m.
In the summer heatwave, the traffic of British pubs in a difficult situation has increased significantly, but the restaurant chains are still under a lot of pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but decreased by 4.8% for restaurants.
Peter Martin, an employee of CGA’s business consulting firm, which compiles the statistics, said: “Thanks to the longest-running world championship performance in the sunny season and England, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when the pubs were 2,8%.
The revenue decline of restaurants by 1.8% in June continued to deteriorate in July.
Pubs and bars selling mostly alcohol performed best, which produced a higher rate of growth than even the outlets at restaurants.
Pubs offering more food were also adversely affected by the long-lasting sunshine, though not nearly as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
It seems that people prefer to drink at a time like this.
Revenue from pubs and bars operated by companies rose by 6.6% this month, while revenue from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results follow a trend that has been trending since the end of April.
Weather, as well as major community and sporting events continue to be the main revenue factor of the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It’s no surprise that restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual revenue reduction of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to the ongoing cost pressure.
It could not have been worse for the long, hot summers for restaurant operators, and it will only be revealed in time that the milder weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area as well."
Total revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, which also reflects the slowing pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK hospitality industry (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is a widely accepted industry benchmark, has a total of more than 9 billion units with a total turnover of 47 members.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents.
According to one survey, one in five children (up to 11 years old) has a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high schools, the number of "Insta-sides" increases
In the wake of the news, the fear of sharing sexual content increases.
20% of students responded that they have a “master” account that their parents can see
One in five children (up to 11 years old) creates a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta-alpha accounts" that refer to the Instagram photo-sharing page is increasing rapidly.
As a result of the news, there is an increased fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students said they have an immaculate “head” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found him on the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a profile of a teenager who said to “rape him.”
According to a study by the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents the directors of Digital Awareness UK and independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” said Mike Buchanan, head of HMC.
Doyle will be the voice of the "athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle, Scotland’s most successful athlete, and body president, Ian Beattie, said that his extensive international experience over the past decade will be invaluable to the decision makers of the sport.
"Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and its presence will help the development of Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am delighted to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really help the work of the Scottish sports leaders.”
Two of the four Olympic gold medals won at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where he was a regular expert on the BBC, were 200 metres and 400 metres, but he was forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain circuitry.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that it would pass over time, whether I'd be back at all.
With a job trying people, but I managed to fully recover, I can walk again, today I am going to agility training!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breastfeeding Ads That Look Like Cow’s Mothers Share the Online Community
There has been a heated online debate over the advertising of a company that makes breastfeeding products, which compared breastfeeding mothers to head lice.
According to Elvie, she developed “the world’s first silent, portable bust” and announced the launch of their product in an ironic commercial citing music videos, which showed what freedom the device gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a stew-filled cowboy booth, while in the background you can hear a song that highlights the following lines: “Yes, I can understand myself, I don’t have a cock yet” and “If I hadn’t come up, these aren’t cocks, but my breasts.”
And the refrain reads, "Pump, pump, so that the child eats big, pump, pump, I cover the girls."
The ad posted on the company’s Facebook page quickly came to the crossroads of online debates.
The video has reached 77,000 views and has received hundreds of mixed-reception comments, many say that advertising is ridiculing the dairy industry’s “fear.”
“To advertise the product with very tasteless cows.
Similarly, their bodies only produce milk if they give birth to their offspring, but they lose their cows within days,” one commentator recalls.

According to another comment: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother animal and for the cow.
But why don't we use them to sell breastfeeding to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added, "It's a completely insensitive ad."
Others were raised to protect the advertisement, one woman admitted that she thought the video was "equally funny."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would have bought it immediately if I were still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not trying to see it anymore.
“The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
According to another commentator, “This is a funny ad at their workplace or in a toilet for mothers who are milking and feel ‘real’ about it.
It is not the milking that praises or condemns."
At the end of the video, the women show that they had a discreet suction cup in their bra while dancing.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use the sucker sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not apply wires and tubes, can be discreetly placed in a breastfeeding bra so that women can move freely, hold their child in hand, or even move out during breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s co-owner and communications director, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
We wanted to draw attention to the parallels between the women who are breastfeeding and those who are breastfeeding, to the challenges posed by the use of breastfeeding, and to sense in a funny way how our breastfeeding provides a sense of freedom in comparison to that.”
Elvie's bust didn't get in the news for the first time.
At London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother dressed as Marta Jakubowski walked out on the dress while using the product.
Hundreds of child migrants have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of child migrants detained has reached a record while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly due to the fact that the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and measures so far have made it harder to find host homes.
Recipients are also typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that it would ruin their chances of staying in the country if they applied for children's admission.
This threat increased further in June, when it was announced that the parents applying for the host and the adults living in a household with them should give a fingerprint, and this information is shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the chief official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in a statement before Congress last week that dozens of people have been arrested who have applied for unaccompanied minors.
The office later confirmed that 70% of the detainees were unpunished.
“Employers and 80% of those living in a household with them are illegally staying in the country, and a significant proportion of them are convicted criminals.
That’s why we continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them must appear before the court within one month of their detention, instead of the 60 days so far, according to social workers.
Many people come to the court via a video conference call, instead of a personal appearance, to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not provide the legal protection, the immigrant is quickly deported.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer the detention takes, the more nervous and depressed the children will be, and the greater the chance of violent eruptions or escape attempts.
According to law enforcement officials, these risks are only increased by a larger facility, similar to the towers, where it is more difficult to filter out those who need psychological care due to the number of children.
They added that if they don’t provide enough time for children to prepare or say goodbye from friends before moving them to such a facility, they will be even more traumatized.
Syria has called for an immediate departure of US, French and Turkish "resisting forces"
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking before the UN General Assembly, has called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the country’s eight-year civil war.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces illegally entered Syrian territory with reference to the fight against terrorism and “will treat them as such.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem testified that the “war on terror is coming to an end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus is “continuing its sacred struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “the illegal presence of foreign nationals.”
The 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, most of them training and advising the Kurdish forces and the Arab militias fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-ravaged country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem argued that the conditions are appropriate for their return, and only "one Western country" is aroused by "irrational fears", deterring refugees from returning home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help the return of the population,” he said.
“They’ve made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition on the conclusion of the war.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey that will create a zone of conflict around the rebels’ last major outpost, around Idlib, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russo-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a wide-ranging attack on the three-million-strong province.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement set “clear deadlines” and indicated Abbey’s hope that the military actions would only be jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked An-Nusra Front, which should be “rooted out.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will be convened soon, with the task of preparing a post-war Syrian constitution and preparing elections.
Moualem’s terms include the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, for example, only “reviewing certain articles of the current constitution” and cautioning against any external actors interfering in the process.
That’s why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless his hopes for a number of liberal viewers come true and he ends his presidency before a trial or a scandal.
We can be sure that this would be "the most dramatic presidential finale of all time."
For now, however, viewers are enjoying the show.
Since 2014, it has nearly doubled to 1.05 million views on CNN's main season, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its views to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers on the show, instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is the most watched cable show with its 3.5 million viewers this evening.
“It attracts us like a fire because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s drama series “The Nominated Survivor.” In this series, the cabinet is sitting in a low-ranking miniseries in the President’s chair.
Nell Scovell is the author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club.
Here’s how to quote a Boston taxi before the 2016 election:
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why,” Scovel asked him.
“Because he’s laughing,” the driver replied.
This is the amusement of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of Roe vs. Wade precedent-like affairs, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can make you not to worry about these facts.
It is no longer a part of the responsible information, however, when we have been watching for the sixth hour of a trial show, in which, according to Trump, we are talking about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward's book "Food."
As far as I'm concerned, from now on, I'll always remember Super Mario.
“It’s a bit like watching a reality show where we’re getting something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, the creator of the song “Stars of the Stars of the Stars”. Trump’s new song is coming out.
If you miss a part, you'll miss it right away.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant 26-degree, sunny weather in Kauain, but he was still sniffing inside his house watching MSNBC while filming the CNN show.
He couldn't break away from television as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing began in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the Supreme Court itself was the future of the game.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were just joking, but it seems they were right.”

Both parties are pouring the money into the toughest contests in the midterm congressional election.
No one was surprised that in Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency, both parties were spending the money innumerable after two active MPs were fighting for the same seat after the congressional districts were reassigned.
One of the contestants for the newly redesignated Pittsburgh suburban district is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former 12th constituency, which has a significant overlap with today's 17th constituency.
The map had to be repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January found that the former district courts had been manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the funding bodies of the two parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), bid almost for each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name came to prominence in Pennsylvania after winning a close contest in the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania, a major March midterm election.
The seat has been Republican for more than a decade, with Donald Trump winning the district with a 20-point advantage.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador because of China’s support and then abandoned the plan.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, to which Washington barely responded.
In June 2017, Donald Trump negotiated with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization’s leadership team from there.
The State Department has recalled U.S. delegation chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for their “recent decision not to support Taiwan,” Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
Sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the United States, including in the fight against drugs, as well as development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have painfully affected the Central American country, where the unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the closed-door meetings continued, the North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, and the primary goal of the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which made it clear that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is also speaking at a conference scheduled for mid-October, which diplomats say is a clear indication of how important the administration is to the event.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue condemning statements and did not enact criminal measures.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, reported anonymously.
Their reports were also supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also only willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next blow may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump has somehow impeded the justice system... but many facts have been made public.
Mueller’s investigation also reportedly includes whether Trump’s team was collaborating with Russia trying to influence the election.
If Democrats get a majority in Congress, they will certainly try to hold Trump accountable, who may have to face the verdict of his fellow politicians after the vote.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain issues, and the fall of Trump is by no means inevitable... just as it is for his European friends of principle.
Serious decisions have to be made on both sides of the Atlantic – it depends on how long the fight will last.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to stab Hitler, just waiting for the West to stand alongside the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
The aid was delayed, so it was not possible to prevent the collapse of the following years.
At historical turning points like this, the inevitable development of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
In today’s America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s chair has been sinking since last year when — as our newspaper reported — he proposed to record talks with the president, and admitted that Trump was incapacitated for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation launched against Brett Kavanaugh is biased or incomplete and is appointed a member of the Supreme Court despite a credible charge of sexual harassment?
And most importantly, are we voting in the midterm elections for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a long winter.
I am confident that this will not be the case, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that was once housed in a building serving as an ambassadorial home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked for candles to be lit on a table bearing the sign of lasciviousness during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how could I be pessimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans plays for the Rangers ahead of the Rapid Wien match
The Rangers will be hosting Rapid Wien on Thursday. Victory against the Austrians after an unexpected draw against Spain's Villarreal can ensure their participation in Group G of the Europa League.
The midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to enter the season's 2–2 match against Villarreal due to his knee injury, but felt that based on this result, the Rangers could also score bolder goals for themselves.
“It was an important point for a great team against Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old.
“We believed we were able to score a point and we also scored a point.
Maybe we could have scored another goal in the end, but we can't complain about the indecisive.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
This Thursday will be another important European match.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were good enough in their previous game, but with our fans behind us, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
“Last year was quite difficult, I got injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys enjoy the game, the training goes well.
I hope that if we put everything in place, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results.”
Many women worry about not saving enough for their old age
Participants in the survey had accurate insights into what age-appropriate care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about it with their family members.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents disputed with their spouse the expected costs of their elderly care.
Only 10% of the respondents said they talked about it with their children.
“Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the issue,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
The following are worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take proper care of you if you don’t tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with your counselor and family, they choose where and what kind of care they want; these decisions have a significant impact on subsequent costs.
Introduce a financial advisor: he or she can give useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be done with a traditional old-age insurance bond, or with a hybrid savings life insurance that can cover expenses, or you can use your own wealth as a cover... if you have enough resources for it.
Prepare legal documentation: In this way, the possibility of further litigation is cut in advance.
Entrust a representative, a trusted person, who will handle health issues on your behalf, oversee your medical care, and ensure that everything happens according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
You can also trust someone to manage your finances.
This trustworthy person will make the necessary financial decisions and take care of paying the bills when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the little details either: Let’s say your elderly parent has been in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, with officials saying the death toll could continue to rise.
The area’s communications network was also damaged, so no news has been received so far from the Donggala Governorate north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 residents had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important data about Palu and Donggara on the island of Celebes:
The capital of the Palu Central Celebs province, on the west bank of Celebs Island, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
It celebrated the 40th anniversary of the city’s founding when it was hit by an earthquake and a torrential rainstorm.
The Donggala Governorate extends over 300 km along the northwestern coast of Celebes Island.
The population of the governorate – a smaller administrative region than the province – was approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebs is mainly characterized by fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years.
A 1938 estuary killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
In 1996, a floodgate reached West Donetsk and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the territory of the terrestrially active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes are common.
Just a few of the biggest earthquakes and tremors in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive quake began on the west coast of the North Sumatra province of Aceh, triggering a rift of 14 countries, which claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, killing more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of violent quakes rocked the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake rocked the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia's largest island, and caused nearly 700 casualties on the southern coast.
2009: 7.6 magnitude earthquake destroyed Padang, near the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake rocked one of the islands of the Mentawai archipelago near Sumatra and caused a 10-metre rush that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface quake reached the government of Aceh Pidie Jaya. The aftermath of panic and destruction reminded many of the memories of the terrible 2004 fountain bear.
This time it was not created, but still more than 100 inhabitants died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a powerful quake claimed 500 lives here, mainly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the land, and thousands of tourists have been trapped on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges in New York City
Track Palin, Sarah Palin, a former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of physical abuse.
The 29-year-old Palin lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of committing domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, state police said in a statement.
According to the police report, when a mistress wanted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took the woman's phone.
Palint is being held in Mat-Su prison in pre-trial detention with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and responded to a question about his guilt, “not guilty at all.”
Palint is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to up to four years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, he is charged with a Class B rule violation, which could result in a one-day lockdown and a $2,000 fine.
Palin is not the first to be confused with the law.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and preventing the reporting of a crime, as well as with possession of weapons under alcoholic influence in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that the man had stabbed him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palint was also criticized by a group of veterans for attributing her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and torrential rains in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a flood that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for power supply and telecommunications have become inoperable, and the number of deaths is likely to increase in the coming days.
The center of the earthquake was near Central Celebs, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are a number of videos on social media about the arrival of the price.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach of Palu at a celebration, when the price of the fountain reached the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Ask for Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are requesting the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipovra, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that claimed eight lives, and have not been executed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with driving a truck rented from Home Depot on a bicycle road on the Lower Manhattan West Side Highway in October, gassing several pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of the victims and "intentionally" inflicted injuries," the New York Southern District Attorney's Office said in a statement.
According to the document submitted, the evidence of either of the two charges can justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipovot was charged with 22 crimes, including eight-degree blackmailing murders, which were used almost exclusively against organized crime, as well as the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack “required significant planning and a preconceived intention,” the prosecutors say, and Saipov said it was carried out in an “identified, cruel, inhuman” manner.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the family of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York last applied for the death penalty of a defendant for a decade.
Khalid Barnest was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time they executed a death sentence in the New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple were convicted two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
Uzbek-born Saipov, according to court documents, did not bear any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the interviews, he said he was happy to do what he did.
Saipov said the ISIS videos he watched on his phone gave him the idea for the attack, according to the indictment.
According to police, he asked for an ISIS sniper to be placed in his hospital room.
In all 22 counts, he pleaded innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipovot's public defenders, said he was "comprehensibly disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
“In our opinion, the actual loss of life for confession would have been more favourable, and the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all the actors involved in the case,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defenses have previously urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for defenders.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage, speaking at the Tory conference, said he was “calling the people’s army to battle.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May’s partners said Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone, who does not fill any office, told attendees of the Birmingham meeting that the UK would have "long since quit" if Farage was Brexit minister.
It is well-characterized by the pressure inside the party that has been exerted on May by the remaining party Toryk at another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires a permanent rift between Brexit and left-wing parties, as well as between the EU.
Despite the negative reactions, his allies are trying to reach an agreement with Brussels that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose between their package or “complete chaos”.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that he had to count down with the Chequers alpha.
He suggested that Farage should be elevated to the House of Lords, and that he should be entrusted with the negotiations with the Spirit in Brussels.
“If he was leading the negotiations, we would have left,” he said.
The wellingborough MP added: “I stand by Brexit, but it has to be counted down with the Chequers.”
Criticising the EU, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars to be the servants of others.
We want to bring about the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the presumption that the 2016 vote had changed the mood: "There is no real basis for the British people to change their minds and want to stay."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Tory Party for Brexit, also attended the meeting and told reporters: “All I ask is: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers principle is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote, the party membership is unpopular, and especially among the activists who work on the ground and have helped us get to government.
Forget the Chequers and listen to us."
As a corner message to May, he added: “Only the Prime Minister can keep his chair, who will keep his word.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians “need to feel the pressure” not to dare to betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, the people and our politicians, is now at stake,” he said.
“They want to sell Brexit, and today we’re here to sell it, we’re not going to let them do it.”
With these words he addressed the enthusiastic crowd: “I would like our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We call on the people's army to win Brexit and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom once again an independent, independent, proud country," he said.
The remaining parties, meanwhile, marched in Birmingham, and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A number of activists waved the flag of the “Turkey Against Brexit” movement that formed over the weekend.
The Labour Party's Lord Adonis was ahead of the Conservatives in the party's application due to security flaws during the opening of the conference.
“These people said they have the IT background to a Canada-plus-plus agreement, to non-existence border crossings, and to a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just talking to each other.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he stressed.
Warren “deeply considers” to run for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she will be carefully considering running for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future at a population forum in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for a November re-election against Republican state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was a co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There have been speculations for some time that he may be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke has been a meeting with voters at the 36th Population Forum since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to leave for the presidential election.
In his response, Warren said it was time for “women to take a role in Washington’s recovery of the half-circulated government, including taking the top position.”
The person suspected of shooting Sims in LSU has been arrested. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Louisian Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a man suspected of sniping the Wayde Sims, a basketball player who plays at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Command reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. East Coast time.
Earlier, a video of Friday's shooting was posted, and they asked for help identifying the man who was seen on the tape.
The 20-year-old Simst reached the University campus of Southern University on early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from a shooting that proved to be fatal," Murphy J. Paul, a police chief, told a news conference on Saturday, according to a report by 247sports.
Wayde's friend intervened to protect him, and that's when Simpson shot him.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was staying at the scene, had a gun, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, and the man was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Captaincy.
A grown-up at Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games in the last season, 10 as a starter, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 knockouts.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the World Cup title after team-leading win over Sebastian Vettel <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play a major role in the race.
Starting from pole position, Bottas started well and almost got Hamilton into trouble as he defended his position in the first two rounds, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, Vettel got into the boxing rink and let Hamilton get caught in the traffic behind the midfield, which should have proved decisive.
The Mercedes stood out one round later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came ahead after a close action during which his Ferrari driver defiedly left the inner bow after moving twice as a defense in the third corner.
Celebrating its 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the wheelchairs, and by the end of the first round it was already the seventh.
He then drove the majority of the race as he did not change his tyres to quickly reach the target and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in hopes of fourth place.
He finished in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds, making Räikköne the fourth place.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let me go.
“The team has done an exceptional job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting as the senator insisted that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing her of sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court's nominee Brett Ka.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony, which he made in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but only noted that what is happening in the Senate proves that people are “loyal, hateful and lying.”
“What can happen, and that’s the wonderful thing that’s happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see anger when you see people being angry, cynical, hateful and lying,” he said.
“When we look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, well, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked?
Remember the answer... you leaked the document? – Oh, oh, what is it?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Well, let's stop for a moment.
We leaked? ... No, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and leaked the letter in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to handle it confidentially, and I handled it confidentially as he requested.”
However, it seems that his refusal was not accepted by the president, who remarked at Saturday night's meeting: "I'll tell you what the situation is: his body speech was very bad.
Maybe it didn’t leak, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president went on to claim that the three women accused of sexual harassment in the Supreme Court are protected by the Democrats’ use of the alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They were determined to do it by any means, but they will regain power.
They can see the hypocrisy, the degradation, they don’t care who they’re hurting, they have to go out and get power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars–Belfast Giants 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in a match against Dundee
With Saturday's 5:3 win in the Dundee rebound, the Dundee Stars raced in Friday's Elite League match for their defeat to the Belfast Giants.
With the help of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants had a two-headed lead early on.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie matched the home team, after which Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's draw and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
This was Adam Keefe's third Elite League win of the season to beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two sides faced each other for the fourth time in the season, with the Giants winning the match in the previous three games.
Dwyer opened in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. from Kendall McFaull's goal, and four minutes later, with David Rutherford's help, Beauvillier doubled their lead.
In the revolving opening third, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt's pass matched Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were able to take a break when he scored his second goal the night before the end of the first third.
The home team reorganized their streaks, and Bouchard again equalized with a man advantage goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's match-up helped Nielsen take the lead towards Dundee's second-third end of the match for the first time, and then secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the last-third half.
The Giants, who thus lost four of their last five games, returned to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller has lost his life in order to save hundreds of people on the plane from an earthquake
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia who lost his life while making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely land.
More than eight hundred people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday, resulting in a typhoon attack.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many have been devastated in the city of Palu.
However, despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung has refused to leave his post in the wildly populous control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palästina.
He stayed there so that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was already on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he ran out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, however, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were exhausted when we heard the news,” he added.
Authorities fear that the number of deaths could be several thousand, according to the country’s disaster relief organization, the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is difficult to approach.
“The number of casualties is expected to continue to rise as many have been trapped under the rubble and many have failed to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Waves up to six metres high destroyed Palut, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aerial vehicles provide assistance and supplies to the public.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Emergency cars bring more bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Small shops have been looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian leader of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors in a race over time, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is a real tragedy, but it can be even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work day and night on the tasks related to the evacuation!
Are you ready?" CNN's report.
Indonesia has been hit this year by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing in plane crash in lagoon
According to a recent statement from the airline operating a plane that crashed in Micronesia in a Pacific lagoon, one man was missing, although it was previously claimed that the evacuation of all 47 passengers and personnel from the landing plane was successful.
According to an Air Niugini press release, a man can't tell you about a passenger, according to the situation on Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to any additional information related to the passenger, such as questions relating to his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospitals.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are not yet clear.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
According to eyewitnesses, the plane took off the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane landed very low.
“It’s a really good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to gasse in water for as long as possible to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
According to him, the flight attendants panicked and yelled, and he suffered minor head injuries.
According to the U.S. Navy, ships repairing a rafting site nearby also helped to save and transported people to shore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters below the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugin.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor on Saturday announced the charges against the man in his retrial, who is accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He told the jury how he compiled the motions of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several phones based on the night of the woman's death with Tellis Chambers, which contradicts the man's previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police interrogated Sanford.
Sanford made his testimony on Saturday, during which he said he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis " lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis reportedly knew Chambers about two weeks ago at the time of the woman's death.
According to the cell phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the woman's text messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
“It wiped him out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio called for a negative view of the genre to the bureaus by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed in Bristol, hip hop has moved away from its roots in political messages and social problems.
They would like to go back to these roots and make the conscious hippo popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Commons are again popular in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is it a black one again?
New York City Dada sued for firing a party after a “racist” message
A New York cop filed a lawsuit against a couple for dismissal due to discrimination after a wrongly sent message to her mother complained that she had been able to use a "black man" cop once again.
The couple denies being racist, and the lawsuit is likened to “extortion.”
The two-child mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her disappointment when the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, saw the woman black on her first day of work when she arrived in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEM, MORE MAKE A FACT!” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after waking up to the shooting, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “unpleasant” about it, fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing scoundrel, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one-day job and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation for his dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internship he was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the march, which cannot be done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations that they were accused of racism that it was reasonable to discontinue Maurice's application because they feared they could not trust him after he was violated.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t understand.
He's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you were rude with, even if by chance?
Your newborn baby?
Come on!"
Plasco, who described the case as “extortion,” said his wife gave birth to the baby only two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would someone attack you like that?
It’s not really a good thing to do that,” added the investment banker.
While the legal process is taking place, the court of public opinion has already quickly condemned the party in the social media, damaging their behavior and logic.
According to a letter just found, Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not be able to connect to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine someone who reads it first before it is published.
This information is pretty fun now that we know what a huge success Paddington is."
According to his father, who worked as a BBC operator before being inspired to write a children's book about a small toy cat, he would not have bothered if his work had been rejected, and he added that his father, on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, would have died.
He called Paddington “a very important member of their family,” adding that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was unimaginable at all,” he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a kid who takes him to something: we’re proud of him even if it’s not really what we deserve.
I think he could see Paddington's success somehow.
"Although he created it and emerged from his imagination, he always attributed success to Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
He and his daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for their lives in vain.
“Nad regularly called me to tell me that she was in a very bad condition and that she wasn’t expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter is going to die in the next two minutes and I have to thank her.
Bye-bye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given by doctors to her to keep her heart beating, she slowly lost weight, and then left her body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to be over.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the others, who did not care about the trial she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I shook my head and all the time my tears were shaking.
It’s hard to explain, but there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That you need my love and my understanding.
I knew you loved my daughter very much.”
Postcard with grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put out postcards filled with inspiring messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef, and her vigil stuck to everyone.
“He knew everyone’s smile.
They always said that her smile would pop up anywhere.”
However, before his death, he gave up his job because he was in “very poor condition.”
Tyler was found dead by his then 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that this would have caused some domino effect.”
Ms. David created the postcards with the aim of “to let people know that there are people who can be searched and talked to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit down, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who for years had lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend, Mark, who had been a life partner for 15 years, not long after the death of the man's mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely under him on Christmas Day: when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything like that."
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to work on it: “He left a huge space in the family.
It broke our hearts into small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting.”

The Future of Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI Begins Investigation
“I thought that if we could achieve what he asked — a limited-time, limited-scale investigation — maybe we could reach an agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall to pieces” because of the party’s decision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI's investigation?
Their resistance can only be attributed to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to fail, it will be much harder for them to get their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby with them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House, and through it also introduced his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to bring Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of dissidents 'decreased' under Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengsko cited data from the Southern Unification Ministry and said that in the last year there were 1,127 dissidents compared to 2011, when that number was 2706.
Park said tighter border detentions between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
The majority of North Korean dissidents are granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are headed for China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China accepts dissidents as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is practically still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, the focus of their meeting was on the heated nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came at a June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on a broader line of cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is unthinkable that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” man who said he was unsuitable for the Supreme Court
The House’s minority president, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “mystical” and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I also inadvertently came to mind that if a woman ever behaved like this, I would call her ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested the rumor that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in their teens.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling, and his voice was closed as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also specifically condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against her “great and coordinated character murder,” organized by angry liberals over the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s behavior had proved that he was not fit for work at the Supreme Court, as he had shown that he was against the Democrats.
“I think he excluded himself with his statements and with the behavior he testified against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable in the event that he fills the post and if Democrats gain a majority in the House.
“I’m saying that if you don’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, it’s not for the court where it is right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the Court of Appeals in the capital.
Pelosi added that he is concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as he considers Kavanaugh a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh’s hearings, he raised questions about whether he would violate the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There is no time here for a hysterical, biased person to be amongst the members of the court, and he expects us to be repulsed by joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to keep their hands on it.
This is a legitimate outburst, which has been accumulating anger on the surface for months and years, and can't get out without crying.
“We’re dying when we’re poisoned,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that rare, do I?”
“I was helped by a woman who worked in a leadership position somewhere,” she continued. “She told me that she was crying in anger, but she developed a technique that, when she started crying in anger, said to her conversation partner, ‘Maybe I’m crying, you think I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was a great idea."
In part, they view tears as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early job, an office dominated by men, where I once began to cry in my angry helplessness that an older woman — a cool manager I was always afraid of — grabbed by my neck and took me to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ve managed to upset you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair with his Monkey Business hair, and as a result of his departure from the competition, Ms. Schroeder was deeply frustrated with the idea that there was no reason why he could not run for the presidency himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and they wanted another candidate in the middle of their back.
It was called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder was left behind with the fundraising, so she vowed not to enter the competition unless she collected the $2 million.
It was a battle of great loss.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“You think I’m getting a discount?” he thought.
When he held a press conference that did not launch an official campaign, he was so moved by the emotions of thanks to the people who supported him, as well as the fundraising and direct access to the voters to a system that made it difficult for him to feel frustrated, frustrated and exasperated.
“They could have believed I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder said, citing how the press reacted to it.
“They could have believed that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my gravestone.
“S<0xC3><0xAD>rt”?
How can the U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening streak of the trade war between the US and China was almost deafening, and while the battle is not yet nearly over, the break-up between the countries could, according to experts, benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump fired first warnings earlier this year by imposing a tax on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place as the new tariffs are already affecting a $200 billion product, taxing virtually half of the goods coming from China to the US.
In any case, Beijing has cut back tariffs, most recently between five and ten percent, on US products worth $60 billion.
China has accepted that it is cutting back every time, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you want to persuade Washington to back down, it would mean you have to give up your belt before the demands, but public rush to the US would be too embarrassing for China’s president, Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is well-tacted, U.S. trade war pressure could be good for China in the long run, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would put any of the economies of the two countries into economic turmoil is far more serious than what observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a non-Asian researcher at Security.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country that was destroyed in a war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem said that the country’s conditions are improving.
"The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who have had to flee between terrorism and the economic measures taken by themselves, which have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Six million more people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would welcome all assistance to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team in a 16.5-10.5 ratio at Le Gold National outside Paris.
The United States has collapsed on the European stage for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its championship title as the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached the 14.5 point needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star who struggled throughout the tournament, threw his punch in the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the win.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in every corner, making him one of the four players who have ever achieved a 5-0-0 result since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth won 5&4 from the lowest-ranked player of the European team, the Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have participated in the last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, became the tournament’s best European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for his choice and faith in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after her European victory.
Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2nd & 1st singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and preceded only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing result of the U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said, "We are proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Down with the hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, with the American PGA and with our Ryder Cup Commission, to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to raise your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us.”
