Barack Obama is the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a check of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the north-western metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The Presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will reach its climax with the ceremony at which Obama takes the prestigious award.
He receives this as the fourth U.S. president, but only as the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes the prize.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgets to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, at which the Prime Minister and 250 invited guests will be present in addition to Norway’s King and Queen.
Obama was very reluctant about the price from the start.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this was a "call to action".
Conservationists are accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz Police accused the chairman of the civil association "Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community" of blackmail.
In several cases, he filed appeals against some construction procedures in the past year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the chief police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
Chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and he faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sortier-müllcontainers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages, you can find the sortier-müllcontainers again step by step.
And in Brno?
It would take a few minutes to find the right trash cans.
I do not want to say that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors do not care enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all due to the number of tons of waste for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moorish square in front of the affected gans.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be upset with us, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not a honey sludge in other parts.
A whole bunch of my friends don’t prefer to sort the waste.
out of flaws.
It’s too far from the trash cans.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on Konicova Street, I didn’t see any tints of rubbish in sight.
Luckily, I got to the right place when driving the tram.
The rubbish was almost gone.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably make the Brno socialists cold.
You’d rather buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the republic than buy a few tons more trash and offer the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brunt.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking on the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brünn is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick money
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no longer any money in the budget for pensions, sick money and construction savings.
But also not for the state debts or for the international court dispute.
This will cause them even more problems that will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for the wage increase for some groups, they calculated that the government would pay the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions, or for the sick-money. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mine laying," says Janota.
Interest is being paid from the loans, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the treasury is empty.
If social benefits or costs for state-owned enterprises are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
To get the pensions or the sick money, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people don’t have to be afraid, they get that money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, the state treasury will not only be missing 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and faster, along with the costs and interest.
The state will need the money to make up for it, then it will no longer be enough to raise the VAT only slightly or reduce the maternity money, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the money laundering in favour of some constituencies, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of highways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly justified.
Get maximum, which is also not free.
This means delays or the discontinuation of thirty large buildings, Europe’s money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the flow of money salomonically – it attacks the CEZ share dividends in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from these the money is then poured into the traffic funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion euros went into the budget from CEZ.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage-liquidation payments, the pension account is filled up and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP, according to EU rules.
But this is not the end of the carnival of revolutions.
Nearly three billion dollars went down the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for the litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gamble.
If we lose an international litigation, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota says.
The minister must then save the money nationally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already launched two billion-dollar project "State Treasury", which is intended to allow on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
Should the finance minister not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
Americans expect the future to have a phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The proposed plans look promising, however.
Just press a button, and from Windows Mobile will switch to Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate these into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware already successfully introduced the journalist to the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the mentioned systems run simultaneously Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to come to the customer by the year 2012.
Snow shortage in the mountains torments hotel owners
Scenic slopes do not only concern the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but by now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year’s Christmas party will be on snow or “on match,” said the information portal operator Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Those who want the New Year’s Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly as they imagined should not hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of your stay is only second place, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think they will try to sell these for a while longer, but then they also have to give up, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, dear Jandura.
Free beds on all winter dates are always offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
About half of the seats are still available in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper Christmas holidays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year’s Eve in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales are also found in the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is not always snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for the snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the weekend in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes be snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than the previous year.
On New Year's Day and at Christmas we only have a few rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80% for the New Year’s Eve stay, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still available for Christmas at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne.
Pleasantly surprised us this year of January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker now is February, but the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains is certainly also rising, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia hotel.
The Giant Mountain Hotel owners are now waiting for a bigger snow shear.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that there will be a warming again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Meteorological Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost bizarre with which student aspirations Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of being the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it down over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario for three years.
Not only did he use the wording “as in Iraq” several times in the text himself, he even used the name of the January 2007 Bush Declaration as the name of his own declaration: “New Forward Path” without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea – fresh troop contingents to be sent to Iraq plagued by the civil war – as an “irresponsible and consequently catastrophic decision.”
But the months that followed showed that the Bush strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only one that was possible and so successful that today there is no more talk in the news about Iraq.
Bush’s reputation was not improved because he objectively left his successor in a much more gratifying starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the troop contingent, the military again asked him, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite his subordination habits criticized the infamous snipers in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but came up with no better idea, and so he deliberately betrayed the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he pushed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy is his intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years, leaving more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they have been formally established correctly, remain only fictitious structures behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially due to the intransparence of the conditions, which further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
The establishment of a “actable state”, which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Timeline of Obama’s strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now on the brink of the explosion.
Believe that the little soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that is not impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans’ willingness to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is in decline.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents how Germany’s or Italy’s security is related to the war in the Hindukusch Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very difficult question arises for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period when America is stepping up to Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only comfort for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to come up with a different strategy that would turn out to be a total failure.
The managers of Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive bonuses in cash
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which thus reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money, but you can only sell them in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers if they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, said former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion for bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to Reuters, despite the measure indicated today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the beginning of the financial crisis.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses that exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
France is also preparing for similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Today in Stockholm, five women from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf have won the Nobel Prize in Literature and in the fields of literature.
In addition to the four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with her countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
Israel’s Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, has received the prize for chemistry for enlightening the ribosomal structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was awarded to the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman won a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith have won this award for their research in the field of fiberglass, together with Willard Boyl for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prize winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate on the acquisition of the money prize.
There are ten million Swedish kroner in each category.
If there are multiple prize winners in each category, the money prize is divided among them.
According to tradition, U.S. President Barack Obama has received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and he is also at the forefront of the country that is leading two wars – in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policies, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to fight for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus will receive finance minister Eduard Janota early on Friday, who is considering his stay in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form that it was released by the assembly of deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet will be the themes of Friday’s meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President's spokesperson, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
On Monday, Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in office.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
But on Wednesday, parliament voted on the left-wing party proposals for monetary change and increased money for government officials’ salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that it covertly increase the budget deficit.
There has been a sharp domestic political dispute between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party on the other, and therefore the question mark on the further work of the Fischer-Official Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have been formed.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquidated the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fisheries Government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, is to end the government debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but doesn’t have to, said at breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the “serious problem,” which is the “unsustainable deficit” of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek said the budget is horrendous, and the government should weigh up its continued existence.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial board as "strong statements".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrendous that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeded 200 billion kroner.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Mandela played in Morgan Freeman's new film Clint Eastwood
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows the world much of the country, its struggle and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, race conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon is in another important role.
I said to him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, but from which, in the end, many have become so important to the slave-holder, as well as to all, as ever, a fictitious, U.S. president.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active activities in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "undefeated", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak.
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that even after apartheid, his people remain racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team is rising to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema.
He had no other goal than to play this role so as to approach this reality as closely as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes in front of his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I noticed that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know how you feel, he said.
It’s important to me to be another person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I called the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film, I look a lot bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The Daily Variety film critic, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "This was a very good story, very well-executed film."
In the movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76% positive reviews.
Light Secret About Norway Dissolved: Russians Tested a Missile
A special light effect was observed over Norway of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful and the missile, dubbed the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian general as well as of the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on site during the missile test did not have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights
This 13th attempt went normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was driving under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is probable that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted from the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has defended itself against this and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fail and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test launch was carried out without failure, the Department of Defense’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore satisfies the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic bomb heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov is back in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former World Champion, Olympian and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in the emergency, and probably already in the Friday goal KHL against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergey Nemcinov.
It is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, co-player Nemcinov said.
When Fetisov returns to the ice rink, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game, according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was credited with 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also achieved success in the NHL, where in the Detroit Dress, he twice lifted the Stanley Cup overhead.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Room.
Hyundai gave up the unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced on Monday that it was ready to strike.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday layer this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday layer.
The employees will also receive it in the aftermath for the Saturday 28th of November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave on December 28th to extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday layer are paid the fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of demands and complaints from trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to abolish all overtime for the month of December.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for another 2 overtime hours.
As of the signing of the agreement, the readiness to strike on the part of the trade unions will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike.
The situation at the automobile factory has escalated last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged scams.
The management was of the opinion that employees had to make the overtime to comply with the automotive supply needs.
The unionists also demanded in their Monday strike-ready call that employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be impeached with sanctions.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5,000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
As of this September, around 80,000 vehicles were produced here, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ‘stealed’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have as much effect on common viral variants as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease AIDS can not yet be cured.
However, the composition of the drugs can prolong the life and prevent the multiplication of HIV viruses in the body.
However, its intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus propagation has also resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have proven that the substances referred to as metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus propagation in a different way than all the drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new <0xCC><0x81>enhanced <0xCC><0x81> compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would form.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the reproduction of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CR Academy of Sciences.
In the paper, published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
A bit weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagent glass, also against their resistant (resistant) variants, which were obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the metalocarborans interesting compounds for further development of effective drugs against HIV and organolastic research aimed at the development of institutes for HIV and biochemistry for biochemistry of the Akaturk, says Pavlina Remiebora, Head of Lazacova.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to Fischer, who resists
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek called the approved budget for next year "grayful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The ODS statement referred to the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he is about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however, with proposals from the Link Party to amend more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for government salaries, for maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that it covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a balance of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the wishes of the government, because even the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisorium.
Disappointment and senselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the case that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up for the premier for Monday after the government deal.
He said he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget.
The extent to which Fischer argues for the further struggle with the budget deficit, so according to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will step down if parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those pertaining to sick pay and pensions or the service bill.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
This is a matter for the Prime Minister and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy office who profess to be TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fisher decides to waive the fight against the deficit ceiling of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I haven’t thought about it, and if it’s going to be current, I’ll deal with it,” Defense Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrats, told reporters in parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon for the European Council meeting.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would likely vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked the MPs of the civil democrats to allow for the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize that my voice would be missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevism of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
The Czech railway will be closed or restricted from 13 December onwards some less-loaded high-speed and local trains, while other connections will be reinforced.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new schedule compared to today.
Most fares incl. base and customer fare will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital, for example, are provided to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses for this route trains of the type Pendolino.
The high-speed train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer high-speed trains also run on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Kingsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis are also cancelled and on a few days a week the operation of some high-speed trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to switch to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth transport route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distances to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel at a time interval of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers will no longer be able to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's bill for regional railways: an increase of 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year receives four billion kroner,exactly as this year.The local trains provide the districts, in total they pay for the next millennium.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains as well as high-speed trains, the railway has re-entered a 10-year contract, so far the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps that is why it has not taken the price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day online ticket CD Net and with cheap internet ticket eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the plug driven, so far it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine millennials arrest more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Militants kidnapped 75 people today in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the agency AFP, which initially informed only over 65 kidnappers.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 million people reportedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the millennials belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police were chasing the kidnappers for the violence that demanded retaliation between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed, the right of residence was imposed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the governor’s office, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, peace talks with the Philippine government resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will appear in the American cinemas “Invictus: The Undefeated”, which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
The cinematography of the film also makes the reactions of critics as well as the public loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sachar Prize, in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when on the one hand, preparations for the World Cup culminate in South Africa, but at the same time the media is the world's public with frightening news about the rising hatred of races and the discrimination of the people on the other hand.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are initially positive, despite numerous reservations against the cast of American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I - as they say - can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film’s festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good to be able to explore Mandela’s personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on a book by British writer John Carlin, translated “In the Role of the Enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people, portrays the South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two races and populations that have been separated from each other year and day throughout the course of the film, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in his role in the South African national rugby dress at the World Cup, which South Africa won at the time.
For the entry of the grass in the dress, which is almost considered a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela fourteen years ago harvested large ovations, mostly from the white public and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may bring people together into a single nation, led by Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only show itself.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, told LN in a recent interview.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to Usti nad Labem district fire spokesman Lukas Marvan, six units were intercepted in the fire.
Originally, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special firing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, according to the company’s spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova, the safety operation of the pipeline system did not endanger the accident.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, more precisely the damage will be counted only after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For over 10 years, nothing like this has happened in the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the wiring system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred in the distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises fines for libel against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, today raises a fine for slandering three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Moravian district, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice district and the head of the Olomouc district, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radiojournal.
The complaint relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional trains in some districts.
In the end, however, all regions have signed long-term agreements with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders are attacking us and saying that we are taking out the Rosins, and we have only submitted the offer on the scale as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this insult to the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal record for the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that even in this matter it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail traffic and uses false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million kroner in advertising, which will point to the district’s detrimental move.
He told the radiojournal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and wants to continue the campaign after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts had agreed to operate regional rail traffic with the Czech Railways and had not awarded tenders for the order amounting to 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contradicts the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, Jancura said, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could lose the bus licenses, too.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don’t say his name, Jancura told the radiojournal today.
Free and voluntary vaccination against pneumococcal disease
Infection against pneumococcal disease changes from January onwards.
It should be free and voluntary for families first.
But already there are reports that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal disease culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
The specialists are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New Vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumonia, which was born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of vaccine yet.
Those who have already started the vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further re-vaccination themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are required.
Overall, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses will spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all area vaccinations of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle lobe inflammation, but also serious infections including cerebrospinal inflammation and blood poisoning.
Due to pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children under the age of 10 die each year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcal pneumonia has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
That the mandatory vaccination would be better, for example, mentioned the head of the civil association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association already promotes long-term pneumococcal vaccination.
The specialists at the international conference in which our association participated were not very satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to enforce that at least.
I think that’s the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal pneumonia.
At this moment we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors say.
The chairman of the association of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary,” Cabrnochova said, according to the report.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcal disease from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is paid as a first area vaccination by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurances should spend the money for prevention, so they save for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
Doctors must purchase the vaccines themselves.
However, there is a concern among pediatricians about the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance could thus "take the money out of the health insurance."
That’s why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until insurance pays them.
According to estimates, the individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son participates in "museum theft"
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was shot with trailer while inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used an excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of characters like Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police state statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should penetrate the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a warehouse".
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta Senior has denied any permission to have issued.
Labour Defends Etat and Tax Increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had let an opportunity "distorted" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor also got fired for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security and a 1 per cent cap on public pay cuts for 2011.
Social Security anxieties
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of upcoming “problems”.
The rise in social security – to around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has upset the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic boom.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
PUNCTURE OF THE VORAB ESTABLISHMENT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% as of April 2011
This year, the economy shrinks by more than expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax deductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of eliminating the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would fall on the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms disputed that the outlined tax increases and spending cuts compared to the necessary measures would be “a drop on the hot stone.”
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit reduction and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions about future economic growth – affecting the extent of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were challenged after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April – while the debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously projected.
"Missing Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion debt would be unsustainable over the next six years.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay it and push themselves “cynic” before difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place no later than June 2010.
“They didn’t say anything of importance about what they were going to do,” said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond, “they had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by.”
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be kept from future cuts, unlike the proposals of the Conservatives, who see the deficit capping coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money earned by the tax increases and spending cuts will be used to cover expenses for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April – the Treasury would put the voter on the charge as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra help when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although ministers have not announced budget details beyond 2011, economists say pressure on public spending will only come to fruition in the medium term.
The recognized Institute of Tax Investigations said the Treasury Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future, also in the areas of transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said his manager Robert Chote.
“The significant announcements will only be made after the election of whoever wins them,” added Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-state report. The markets recognize that."
FBI Investigates Arrests of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Panchab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether they are the same men who were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are U.S. citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges that are brought against them and the circumstances under which they are being detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the authorities were informed of the arrests and were in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said local police had already taken an interest in the house and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it refused Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said the United States must work "again with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International Condemns 'Missbrauch' in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the last 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man cited in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights balance sheet.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of prisoners and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the start of the protests, the top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kharizak penitentiary.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari as saying he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty said.
Presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that the abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former prisoner who said he had been detained in a container at a prison in Kahirizak for more than eight weeks with 75 others.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government’s responses to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results won by the parliamentary committees would not be won.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a race track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for prize money.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glittering below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art performed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a building ban on minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most widely secularized sects.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't like head scarves" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a dispute that has been going on in the country for a year and a half.
Bowen’s latest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Liberations."
He is a good listener, he relays debates between teachers and students about the issues that are most troubling them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he claims, that make up daily life, quite in contrast to the political dramas that the media occupy.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, to be a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don’t have all the arguments on your side.
The Conservatives are distrustful of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – which today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who, in turn, had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a “strengthening of value screws” rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "yes, but not yet".
The world's most unfortunate sight
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks it melts at alarming speed and takes life with it, which can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their Kiel waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Migrated through the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old seafarer who fought only with the pistol of his musket is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically own a millionth of the habitat of a wild algae. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore became quite green by the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its pelvis.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by hunters for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, landing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sledging Inuit use powerful storm guns to track their prey.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and worrisome description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
This is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time led to the confusion of the packeise.
U-boats in the Cold War measles the shifting grates while underwater.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-area deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but much is still achieved by undeterred people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater basins that are compressed together during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice breaks, which is expected to pass in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... it could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson, a freeman, took the bus for seven hours to put a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who took the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
“In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be that,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay crowns on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 crowns on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back something to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers migrated across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War as their target, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples were holding hands as they carried the fresh jaw branches to the graying gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the icy air.
Some read out the names carved in stone, while others leaned down to small black-and-white space maps that had been put into the damp mud for those whose gravestones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She was driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Navy Undercover Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
“If I’ve been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. consular officers in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The special indictments have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of “threatening”.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to heighten tensions between the Castro Brotherhood’s Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy attaches great importance to the fact that the United States will provide a reward if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desirable products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used mainly for texting, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Many websites have limited access to the site.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind bars for crimes like drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information on the arrest.
The arrest and the arrest are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", who recently published a hard report of Fiul's filing on the freedom in Cuba.
Vivanco said the defendants would very often be arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, right at the time when both countries are moving towards greater readiness for dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hoped this case could help radicals to dismantle a broader network of terrorists, according to Reuters.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after finding her because one of them had commented on terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Upon her arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote territory in Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan’s intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to subvert the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unreal mountains in the northwest, which have become a refuge for terrorists.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That’s why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men – who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI – underlines the crucial role applicants play in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The applicants of the organization act as stewards who do not include those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
U.S. would-be recruits will be subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years in terms of who they allow access, as the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
“If you’re trying to include someone in these groups, what better way to go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded from the dealers at the city’s Bella Convention Center bolder action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event went relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists ignited small explosives near some government buildings in the downtown area.
On a day when the UN-supported climate negotiations were short-lived, thousands of activists migrated through the city with transparencies on which in English said “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish declared “The Earth says “genuine.”
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother’s homeland, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to deal with due to the already tangible effects of climate change.
That’s part of the reason I’ve decided to take part in the big demonstration – to extend the word and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it anymore.
Police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing ignited several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light rockets, but then were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently failed to reach the awareness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “This is something I was not even aware of.”
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual’s perspective on whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Examination data show hardy breed air
The math performance testimonies last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the nation’s schools that deliver top performance, the evidence shows that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but that of their African-American counterparts only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance air rose from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eighth graders remained essentially the same, dropping by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scaling points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points the children of both groups have achieved has increased in this period, the difference has now barely decreased by 58 points.
Some of the district’s education advocates expressed concern last week that the results, which were celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were mostly by white students, who have already been propelled by powerful children.
This suggests that we’ve raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult,” said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group advocating for education equality in Washington, D.C.
I’m not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councillor Kwame R. Brown, who has a fourth-class daughter from Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of test scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don’t spend nearly all the time and energy we have to spend for our high school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the poorer students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new curriculum, the Wilson-Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their classroom careers and who have significantly mastered their classrooms.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and life-like experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former head school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is reported to be some of the NAEP progress that was made last week.
I think we need to continue to work on bringing the best measures to the students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources for the weaker schools that are needed to bridge the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who investigates urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could provoke political repercussions that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, no matter where they live, can be sure that their children will receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with charter schools.
You need to raise the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers’ union last year over 185 days a year, which he considers to be “a milestone” on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects
The bus travels to Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stands out and blinks a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group, who explored Gettysburg, where teaching costs $38,690 per year, was more that of an honorable visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
“Wow, really?” she said thoughtfully as she was told of the school’s low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully embraced the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the U.S. who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into high school.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanic Americans graduates from college – a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study high-performance children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, who examined Spanish-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program, which was funded by Graciela’s College Tour, is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP – One Gang Up – and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they graduate from high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraq’s Ministry of Petroleum concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven U.S. companies had paid for participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that made an offer has pulled the shorter ones.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thin-seeded representatives of the U.S. oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of U.S. companies, Asians and Europeans are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, have likely prevented U.S. oil companies from engaging more strongly in Iraq, the world’s third-largest proven crude.
U.S. companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to enter into contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have sided with technical advice in recent years, have gone vacant.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-run China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world’s biggest economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can meet with its partners and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
For the bidding, pre-selected companies made bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's Top Plane Killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top al Qaeda deployment planner was reportedly killed this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials reported on Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior official of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs reportedly killed by a number of rockets hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in northern Waziristan province on Tuesday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan’s illegal tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the scene and quickly took over everything that was left of the “completely destroyed bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism representatives provided indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as the Al Qaeda’s leading military planner who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy around the world, remarked a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly risen in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal territory and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, according to a summary from the Long War Journal, a non-profit website, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
UN envoy to Kabul to resign
U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term that was smashed by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eid’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is set to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
“We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community,” Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aides to assist in the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he is not laying down his office, but only fulfilling an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now redirecting so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better for him to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between the passing of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun the search for a replacement.
The U.N. representatives say he considered the Swedish-Italian-stam Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eid’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and concealing evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has rejected all the allegations, but he also said that Galbraith's allegations - which was fired - "were undoubtedly damaging to the mission because there was already a large amount of skepticism regarding international interference in the election".
Eide said he had recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the auxiliary actions of the US-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate for the Afghan mission, and said this would strengthen their confidence that their money will be used properly.
Oide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN ceasefire regimes have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is disastrous and must not go on like this.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for not participating in talks on its nuclear plans.
During a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that is war-like inpredictability.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average range.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "your people will suffer enormously" under the sanctions.
In a statement on Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "believable" consequences if it does not meet the demands of the International Atomic Energy Program, the UN Security Council, and its nuclear watchdog.
Iran continues to argue that nuclear technology knowledge should only be acquired for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and abandon a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the interim agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community with regard to some proposals that it had already agreed to at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that it has never said in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "suppressive sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations condemned what it on Thursday called "baseless and unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said they were willing to agree "to negotiate a solution with the United States for a long time, and for five other countries."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to lower the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to lower U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concerns about the impending withdrawal of troops, US representatives quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
A Change in the Ageing of China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave".
These lessons they have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, which, due to the low birth rate and the aging population this summer, suddenly began to change course and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was not immediate and definitive.
We have already invested all our time and energy in one child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child policy in China, which has brought forth two generations of notoriously thick, neglected single children, affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis in the country is looming.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN said.
Department for Population Issues, while the population group of 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to increase from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent explosive-like. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and seniors accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples need to get babies of childbearing age to “help lower the ratio of ageing population shares and alleviate the labor shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Enshrined in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy have to face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already have a child to be abducted.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have had single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said government officials had recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a partner who is single.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who comes in question for a second child and how to apply for the approval.
The city administration has sent city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push information sheets through the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said there was a surge in applications from couples who wanted a second child after the campaign began, the urban districts did not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still submitted per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births in the city expected for 2010 despite the campaign will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are likely to be the main reason why many people don’t want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this is also legally allowed.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are misjudging one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the chief of staff, said she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to caring for others, and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it unabashedly.
For middle-aged parents with double careers through which the birth rate drops, he said, it’s all about being successful and you have to be selfish about it.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they don’t want a life like that at all for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the spatial question -- "You have to renovate your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you have to have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Develops Plan to Reduce Emission
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterised by wild possessions and mutual accusations -- has once again placed a spotlight on Friday with the publication of a document that will see an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations in the nearest future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that runs out of time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a UN working group created specifically for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise would be that policymakers would contribute.
The process will be given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN climate chief Yvo de Boer has called “the great whole.”
It shows the groundwork for a possible agreement whereby industrialized nations, together, would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 thresholds, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted the talks on Friday by ensuring that over the next three years, it will provide US$3.6 billion per year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of the floods and devastation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that had been scheduled for the talks last week.
U.S. climate special commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that demand binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not financed by industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is on a harder line with China than the Bush administration did two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging countries rising up and taking action, so Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough, will ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister He Yafei said it was either lacking in “reason” or it was “highly irresponsible” from him that he said earlier in the week that he would advocate global warming to the United States.
As the future economic march of the great world powers is at stake, break-ups have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States succumbing to their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would have to ignore the most influential countries.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the big powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of slowing down the greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to go to their homes more aggressively in the process of making sure the countries with very high levels are doing so.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The small island nation alliance, which has 43 members, submitted a 24-page draft treaty on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island states’ offensive “exercises political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks received a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the arrival of the heads of government in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, are taking their planes up and down through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stamp out claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer extent of the gathering -- 13,000 people go in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists run night-time shows, where they make fun of the countries they think betray and sell, and draft contracts are hand-in-hand instead of e-mailing.
The intensity is just building up: almost all of the key ministers are here now and from Wednesday there will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Oberliga,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h high-speed train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train ride that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect the UK to an international rail network of faster, more reliable trains and connect the major congestion areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuter cities, work arrival times would be radically reduced, and switching from plane and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and road traffic congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still pull the brakes on the British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will submit the report to Lord Adonis, according to the Times, on December 30.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass with a five-metre range in urban areas and places where the environmental impacts are controversial.
In the open ground, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 is also set to create three options for a larger, leading high-speed rail network northwards.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped track guide, in which a single high-speed track would lead into the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railroad insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first sub-route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travelers to take the London-Birmingham route back in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The designs offered the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed in such a way that 400-meter-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people could ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be operating per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This in turn would mean that London would need an end-station at which 20,000 passengers could be produced per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued in his opinion or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it moves the wheels, the rail network needs to be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is seen as a crucial breaking point in order to ensure a switch from aircraft to rail, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Arrive for Mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orangery of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservatives’ leading lower house member, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he was reading building himself in his constituency’s residence.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of the lower house had to live “of leaner rations,” has raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framework plant at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer with the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
Officials at the lower house approved the applications at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenses of the members of the lower house, last night Duncan said that the applications "could not have been cleaner or more comprehensible".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the lower house, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending checkpoint of the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he cultivated a winter garden, which in the plans is referred to as "orangery".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased cash intake during a recent review of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee released him last month after an examination of his expenditure from breaching the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, a year before his election to the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week show that Duncan received about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,500) per month as a mortgage interest refund until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000) per month.
The interest rate on Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the entire increase was used to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>85,000) takeover.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim its entitlement to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him as he said after the spending scandal that MPs would live "of leaner rations".
Essentially, when you work for the state, it means that you have to live by lean rations and be treated like a ****.
He said, “I have spent my money on my garden, and I am entitled to a very small portion of what belongs to it.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The MEP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for his expenses, when it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had cleared with the Fees Office that this could be considered "an exaggerated demand".
An activist has dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds over three years.
When questioned last night about the raised mortgage, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about evading and skipping or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new way of life for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
“Beyond,” an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas songs as a theme for each December.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to see the latest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free sparkling wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday demonstrated to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday that could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to what these demonstrations show that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had shattered windows with tiles and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-disturbance police have intervened immediately and without regard.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your estimate, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitters, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that about a hundred of them were "still held in the streets on Saturday night and held in extreme hands" despite the fact that the protesters had been held in a position of "extremely".
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have travelled by buses and trains from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue raincoats, made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of the friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
“We are going to the streets to demand a reparation of ecological debt in favor of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say, “We have time,” said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, water runs where you can walk like it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
European Parliament member José Bové, in the form of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for a different world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk as a result of the warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and housed bandanas in which you celebrated the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, riots of a few hundred protesters took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounced that this is a “strike.”
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, denouncing Tbilisi the “strike.”
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first post-August 2008 Russian-Georgian war election for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the closing of the polls, according to the Abkhazian electoral commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former President Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
This election is a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia wants to prove by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to choose to a polling station that was in a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs that Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations,” replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, who raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has, in turn, criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, as those in Abkhazia Russia control of the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Worldwide demos, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, at any time ready to deploy, have detained about 700 people on the brink of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by December 18th receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to come into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to infiltrate.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began hitting discs, an AFP reporter said.
Anti-disturbance police officers immediately circled you and acted recklessly by throwing some of you to the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splitting groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury from a plaster stone at the chin during the incidents, in which according to police about twenty people were provisionally arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police were circulating in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or by car from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to be a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today we are going to the streets to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the south,” said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say to ourselves: we still have time," said singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that fail, there are watercourses through which one can walk, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in which the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, have made commercials for solar energy in front of the Philippine capital’s city administration.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", notably in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the Lycée.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the national education minister Luc Chatel said that the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the lycéen, even if they are not compulsory in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re (11th school year) now have every four weeks and the same program," Mr Chatel confirms.
For the minister "must be overcome this hypocrisy", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "of the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued, stressing : "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of abolishing compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with a scientific profile), as well as the links of teachers and intellectuals.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which, in their opinion, falls victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister concluded that in Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will be subject to a subject-specific suitability test and at the end of the year, they will be subject to an admission test, in which their teaching skills will be tested.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He went on to say, “If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours that you have spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
Finally, the minister stated that he wants to offer “the individual right to education” – a “thing that does not exist in popular education.”
He reiterated that he wants to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice president of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", has to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the “Ernest” conferences, where experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
You want to do something to reach people and to inspire them to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, explained at the edge of the conference. The name of this event is derived from the name given by the students to the fish in the pool of the school.
"Among the experts, twenty participants were selected, even according to their charisma," he clarified.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be explained in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke to about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed, in the hope that the audience might learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delay in payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of law enforcement officials called on Friday for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, whose payment was postponed for budget reasons until January, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers (FO-Pénitentiaire) called on employees who do not have a service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning in order to draw attention to the “theft of what is theirs”.
The 3rd Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite to a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtimes, night shifts, as well as the "sun and public holidays" will be treated as "sun and public holidays".
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institutions Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The Directorate of the Criminal Enforcement Agency and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime has increased sharply in 2009 and not all were provided for in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of law enforcement officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
“I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep and modernize our criminal justice system functioning,” the Justice Minister said in the letter.
"I have instructed the management of the penitentiary to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen as a result of a lack of assessment of the overtime incursions, does not repeat itself in the future," added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December salary is thus lower, except for the management staff, which enjoys high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains, for which the "household constraints" must be maintained.
“This is an absolute scandal,” the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces to boycott “all assemblies and convocations” up to new instructions.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours from October to December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtimes," also threatens the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
“At a time when we are being tasked more and more without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich ourselves with the staff’s money is more than inappropriate,” the CGT union in Bordeaux said in a statement.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, says the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama is of the opinion that he distributes Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV spokeswoman Oprah Winfrey that he is always distributing better gifts than he gets himself.
At a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday night over the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog, of course, also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama rebuffed her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts. “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she kisses the president.
"So please," he murmured, and pointed to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you these?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a relaxed atmosphere with the well-known television hostess, who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama recalled a 10-speed bicycle and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought with him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady, in turn, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to put the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Confirms He Was Moved to Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after surgery in France, according to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was shifted into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-opened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "damages due to the operation of a bandwidth" that he had suffered from a production accident in Paris.
However, the singer’s production company wanted to clarify that the situation was “under control” and said that a new medical consultation would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, only after 48 hours was there a bit more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "it appears from certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a bandwidth incident.
The surgery, planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments to RTL.
After surgery by Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a subsequent infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley", but he assured that there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician as he was "a good fighter".
“He had called me before he left for Los Angeles and I told him it was foolish to get on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, which is not the case,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is curbed".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and he felt no particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer’s health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, the speech was that Johnny Hallyday had a “small bowel cancer surgery” that resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as planned as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not forgotten that the singer on stage had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to be denied re-delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short track: first place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m.
Unfortunately for Bousquet, who wanted to reach the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 seconds. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at the international level.
Bousquet forced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever bigger things and in this case, I said if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which started in 1999 in the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has managed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't set a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S.: Zola's tombstone is estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone, which appeared calculated at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday over its value, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century AD and was always valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, are a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, vice president of auctioning of Roman and Egyptian services.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is definitely what buyers have offered the most so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the marble part by Emile Zola goes a long way back.
The record has been in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection at home, after which she dived piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom in her Paris hotel for this purpose and came to Péllcha, Minister of the Third Marquess of France, and to Paul Reynaud, Minister of the French Republic.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "erb of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya’s attempt to leave Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of fallen Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil no longer compatible after the coup government rejected the move as unacceptable.
After a phone conversation with President Zelaya last night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
According to the immigration authorities, the Mexican government-provided plane, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring Mr Zelayas, returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to require Zelaya to "thank you" and to seek political asylum for him abroad.
However, the overthrown president refused to do so because he wanted to return to Mexico as a welcoming, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a recurring failure by trying to move me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has been mellowing word since the beginning of the political crisis, which has remained in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and I like to stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the attack of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not include an application for asylum, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not seeking asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had emphasized, would only be undertaken as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Mr. Zelaya’s departure had mobilized supporters of the fallen president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it on Wednesday, after which the military there had intensified its use.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the coup's position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day of the referendum he organized to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he had unexpectedly returned on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for high treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
President Roberto Micheletti has managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the contested election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street is booming, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high, the figures on the U.S. balance of trade show a price recovery of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, dominated by technology, rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor’s 500 was credited with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market is only focused on “half-full glasses”, she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the figures on the U.S. trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit dropped by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers over the past four weeks has fallen “to the bottom of the year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared to 3,432% on Tuesday night, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4,492% compared to 4,408% on the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in power pipe out "Women in White"
Hundreds of Cuban-held partisans on Thursday stabbed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day, as well as a different scene, for which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners, were stabbed on the open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march into the center of the capital to demand the release of the political prisoners.
Down with the Yankees!, "Söldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans chanted with raised fists against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil servants who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana the night before, in which there were neither injured nor arrested.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also made their way to the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents who have been expelled by the government’s partisans under the use of force to enter civilian vehicles.
Temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As advocates of the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Dames in White" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of the "Petition for the Release of All Political Prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list has about 200 people, Höfeng Heheent, a member of the public of the European Parliament.
Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom have been behind bars to date.
The Cuban authorities see the regime’s opponents as “soldiers” or “agents” in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstrations between militant pro-government fighters and “contrarevolutionary” fighters.
Cuba, led by a unified party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of degrading rights and freedoms, especially freedom of speech.
Madman kills 80-year-old with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An insane man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday afternoon at the main business time and injured five others.
According to the first indication of the interrogation, the 28-year-old had injured the 80-year-old for an unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is responsible for the consequences of his injuries, according to a police syndicate Alliance in the hospital.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he's hooked up with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person is at risk of life, as according to police sources, he was apparently affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police cell.
The gunman, who appears to have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is reported to have escaped on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passengers, apparently accidentally: a three-and-a-half-year-old and a forty-year-old, while the latter of the two was severe.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he was wearing crosses behind his back, Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Alliance union of the Hauts-de-Seine region, said on the spot.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have attempted to bandage the insanity, according to the AFP’s witness reports.
I saw a guy in the 1930s with a green vest.
Three young men tried to enter.
They failed because the guy was well-built, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including their supervisor, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife stitches, police said.
The event took place in one of the main battlefields of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby came to me to let me know that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in first aid position and noticed a flaking wound in the stomach, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cut wounds.
Officials of the state police have finally arrested the man who did not carry ID cards with him.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre has commissioned the District Criminal Police Department of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been tried in court.
A police cell does not rule out that it is being delivered to a nervous health facility.
According to another police source, six police officers bandaged him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of superstition" as "all the mentally confused of this kind in which the forces free themselves during the course of the act".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for suspension of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) called for prosecution against his client, who is currently facing death row at his residence in Switzerland, more than face trial for a 30-year sentence.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the "pianist", has filed a gross case at the time of the trial in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeals in the second district of California.
I demand on the spot release, Mr Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time, "was left to one coldly run his back down".
According to him, the now-deceased judge, Rittenband, before he dropped his case, had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house -- which represents a serious procedural error.
This discussion was sparked in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski: Pursued and Desired), especially by the questionable prosecutor David Wells.
Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "lying".
Should the Court refuse to stop the criminal proceedings, Mr. Hummel asks for the conduct of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the defendant’s committed acts cannot be taken seriously unless Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the sentence for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old minor was announced.
Since then, he has no longer traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney General Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the hearing".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that “there are other alternatives to escape.”
Hummel was not the only one to request the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for the criminal proceedings to be lifted.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski case, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then convicted in anticipation of possible extradition to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and ends without a price.
On Friday, the New York Stock Exchange closed without a price in a market that was torn between better indicators than expected in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is pretty quiet,” said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tightly limited, the trading volume has become very small and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the release of better economic indicators than expected, which “have helped improve the market outlook for the solidity of the economy’s recovery,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summed up.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, so already two months in a row and far more than expected.
Confidence among U.S. consumers improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s index forecast.
However, the indices were slowed by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, pushing “the sectors susceptible to the economic situation down,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost something in the ground.
The bond market has declined.
On Wednesday evening, the yield of the 10-year bond increased by 3.540% from 3.482%, and the yield of the 30-year bond increased to 4.497% from 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World re-election in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch it in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already got their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were simply extraordinary.
I’ve seen a lot of things and made a lot of experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone enthusiastically.
This competition will be held for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday from 5pm CET onwards.
I couldn’t imagine a more beautiful country to surrender my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have done this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova underlined in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of " breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to step in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as succeed Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it’s every woman’s dream to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to forget, in the swimsuit.
The show is presented by a television host, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World Committee head Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with hardly to surpass warmth and pride, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have, as last year, made a safari that visits the famous township in Soweto, but this time cost by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone remarked.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I’m wrong about people I’d probably never be able to get close to.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, promised excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News on Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday on his arrival at the Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got out of the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "quickly" go to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday due to a bacterial consequential infection following an operation at a bandwidth incident in Paris on November 26.
The singer was "brought into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and carry out his treatment," the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma, in which he was delivered on Monday due to a bacterial sequential infection after a bandwidth operation in Paris on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the painful changes that had arisen from the last operation.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hospital Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely strained the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told that he committed the purest massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were completely disequipped, Mr. Camus said.
I’ve heard that a trial is likely to be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "much too fast and this has traveled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I personally phoned this doctor, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself already have two bandwidth operations behind me.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to be forgotten, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Chamber, has called him "a man without scruples" who has "regularly" to answer to the Board of Directors and is "everything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and that the postoperative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been going on since Latvian summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that there is little to do for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr. Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's party MoDem, on Friday reacted fiercely to an attempted takeover of the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by several of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre's party.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his efforts, he had received the support of Member Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to apply for this brand at the "Institut national de la propriété industriale" in 2004.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous' friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they were not allowed to be abducted and set a time limit for the minister and the MP, under threat of judicial persecution, to their right to refuse this seal.
You have made numerous statements in the last few days that you would propose to your political movement to take the UDF seal<0x2B><0x2B>, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, as well as by the Art of the Sennizentrum of the Sennhaus de Sarnez, the party.
They also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement <0x2B>Nouveau centre<0x2B>, the slogan <0x2B> of today’s UDF<0x2B>, on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you do not have a right to use this seal, the UDF office stated, and urges NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was requested "to transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal entitlements".
If you deny this, we will file a lawsuit against you in order to comply with the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to "grown" the UMP party.
The Nouveau Centre Party therefore, according to the signatories, has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the establishment of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the department continues, "he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years at the time when he applied for the brand name" but of the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to carry it out for himself.
Furthermore, let us note that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironicize the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more dignified to give yourself a right to make a name for yourself, instead of trying to get on the We, rather than trying to get out of the anonymity, in.
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier sentenced for exploiting weakness
The court in Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the daughter of billionaire billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, has taken advantage of a weak moment of the eighties to gain a share of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be held responsible on April 15 and 16, 2010 for exploiting weakness in court, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this case worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter fatten each other and at the same time have the ropes of the L’Oréal cosmetic empire in their hands.
However, the 15th Chamber ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L’Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down during the investigations by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday are due to submit a report before March 10, 2010, clearly stating whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will be subject to these investigations.
I will speak to her, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Ms Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As far as Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very pleased with the court’s decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady that you have to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has filed a criminal lawsuit against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years in order to make her donations of a total of one billion euros in cash.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers on Friday led to a large family dispute.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer referred to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she mistrusted the husband of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, I wrote to Banner one or two times a day.
I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to respond so, especially because a presiding judge in recent days has rejected her application to initiate a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor’s representative.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the admissibility proceedings of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers have taken place.
The Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing.
For over a decade, the attitude of management of large companies regarding its employees, said the position of the companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best, as it was previously on the consumer products in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of the local markets... even though the authoritarian temptation products separate factors the preferences of the customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique <0x3D> economic intelligence) "requires a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach from all parties involved"; it demands from the employees an approach that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would consist of putting employees at the centre of the company’s concerns equally alongside customers.
The Very Conditional Benefits of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its payees, incite this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid I'm not.
- First of all, because I could see that the whole structure in the face of a new situation, after many turns, finally comes to do primarily what...what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionately to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplistic notion of human behavior.
From the great engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the ancient behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unwittingly disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the “heel” (sic) for employee engagement, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into every consideration or practice of management: for the payees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which allows them to assess, through their perceived image of the company, what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is conducive to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
U.S. rights welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had ridiculed Obama’s award on October 9, applauded the president’s speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself spoke of the subject of a “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs published in her soaps.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, tried to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his decision nine days ago, 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, represented the opinion that the president did "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, cheered the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to “the existence of evil in the world” in Obama’s words.
In some parts I have felt this speech is quite historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is considered by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, said he was delighted to have seen a “president of the left” who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they could not exist if they were “not free from the, and not free for a prize”.
For Michael Gerson, a former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given “a very American speech.”
In addition to imagining himself as a "cosmopolitan" like "he always does," he "speaks like an American president" when he points out that Europeans "live like in a security bubble that they didn't create themselves and for whose protection they don't do much," Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "dull, harrowing and uninspired".
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the recourse to the armed forces.
If one packs the war under the cover of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains laudable on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, called the speech itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo “offers a timetable for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” according to the California daily.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Three Marathons for an Agreement that Secures Supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday night that put an end to the strike order and the imminent severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted ways early Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And that even though the three employers’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest pay groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we'll start small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal", although it was "difficult to concede these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
“This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees,” said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of “a historic agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3%, as well as the maintenance of the overall road transport rate in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of the tariff contracts to be addressed.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the drop in taxes for employers amounting to 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 Bill of Corrected Finance, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for an “identical” vote from the Senate.
The signing of the TLF permits that the agreement first applies to the companies affiliated to this organisation and that it subsequently applies to the entire occupational status in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
The opposition of the employers’ associations can only push the process forward.
The FNTR advocated a “fraudulent trade” because the 100 million euros “were already promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to upset the gans-esser on the upcoming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens "to scoop up a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris area and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris passenger traffic management) was their main concern.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00.On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was available and outside the central line only one of four trains was available for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, forcing the passengers to switch.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is working to connect the big businesses in traffic".
The RER A line runs through the Parisian confluence from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains was scheduled for main traffic time, and almost none during low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human will on the railways, as the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had set themselves up for the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than otherwise, mainly due to the lack of gymnasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), stated that he would be extra "a half hour early to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the passengers through staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no shortages at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the station Saint-Lazare to ensure a connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Manager proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with respect to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South), they are demanding a long-standing pay raise.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself was putting its salary proposals in brackets, stressing that the leadership tip "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a re-meeting for the "comprehensive review of working conditions" is scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership that rejected any discussion until now during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a pre-announcement by Unsa and Independents.
The associations demand a wage increase of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they deplore the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, have a gross salary of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a salary increase of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party. Decision With Serious Consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that followed immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community, enormously difficult to put an end to the conflict that has been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> four days after the decision.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to suspend the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the political leaders, were expelled by the chairman Ahmet Türk and the members of parliament Ay.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turks and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders said before the verdict that parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than act as partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, accusing the DTP of following the "leads" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures it has “no connection” with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court works between the government, which is striving to confront the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to defeat the support of the PKK by the Kurds and end the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emergence of tensions in southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan had led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the multi-million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement deployed tear gas grenades and water throwers as the demonstrators began throwing molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Turk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen the desperation even further".
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, note editorial) issue on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
That doesn’t solve the problems,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo to the democratic opening that has been promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"You can obviously focus on a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The Snow Breakdown May Come
A really crunchy winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
But so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
On the weekend it could be so far for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows extensively in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-streets will depart with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Straße and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting routes, <0xC3><0x96>PNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with traps, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
The approximately 1,040 kilometers would need to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better adhesive.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it only snows at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service leader, "because then no one is willing to make room for the forklifts".
Only after that, if it does not snow any more, are delivery and development roads, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Straße, in line.
The last priority has side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger said.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES are on the road, points of danger and transitions are cleared above all.
For the most part, the FES cannot take care of all bicycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22:00 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
Since there is rapid smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scattering is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-long animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with silk claws, and a long tail.
If the species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body features, according to Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund Confirms Theories About Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts don’t necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current theory, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these ancient dinosaurs is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the squirrels split into their three main lines of development: the meat-eating theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor and also the birds, which were known as the "long-tailed squirrels" the squirrels and the squirrels.
According to analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, as they also have the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacks and lightweight bones, it is likely that the common ancestor of both groups had produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the squirrels first appeared there.
As a result, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all the continents that were still a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangäa.
The fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods, speaks for this.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are contradictions as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonner paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted image could emerge, because in South America there are just so many primitive dino fossils preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to find.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant landworms of the Middle Ages is still enigmatic.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying squirrels and numerous other squirrels.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the kinship at the border from the Trias to the Jurassic extinction.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
However, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halfed a group of animals to bloom, which had also evolved in the Triassic and has since been tempted by a shadow presence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are based at the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt hits waves around the world.
278 professors and teachers from the Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University president Werner Müller-Estler had left the building occupied by students and lecturers in the education strike in the past week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured in the incident.
The damages, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves “the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest” and deflects from the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn itself from the necessary discourse.
The professors call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage, it says.
Legitimized protests
The youth of the Verdi Trade Union and the German Trade Unions Union are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi Secretary of State for Youth Alexander Klein.
Hesse’s Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the Unipresident and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left saw this differently.
The CDU is taking painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one has made room.
The left has filed a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded site for secret armament research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have made contacts with the Frankfurt research site Riedberg - with the Union Institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several reciprocal visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and the Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning decorator Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science focal point will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges (disambiguation)
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the Fiz will be able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science firms want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist city plan" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 can not be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the deepening of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg’s capital city into a devastated construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Railway stations with railroads ending in the middle of the city were then considered as 19th-century traffic fossils, which looked like brake pads of modern rail traffic, as it once took a tremendous amount of time to reengineer locomotives from the back to the front.
Drive in, keep short, keep going - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that’s why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
The S21 is now actually being approached, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality anymore.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost inexpensive to implement the deepening.
However, the main railway stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern reversals with motor vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Still: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE-Neubaustrecke to Ulm is now being approached.
Local and local politicians have done it.
The railway also contributes because it carries the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state corporations.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be justified in some ways.
A new urban space is being created, which - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the route are designed for passenger traffic, which - typically in the 80s - has been attributed to huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap planes.
Modern transport policy, however, must first of all focus on strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than by trucks on the road.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to steep increases.
What is even more important is that S21 indirectly tackles many other railway projects.
Six billion euros are to be banned in Swabia.
This is the official number.
Experts think ten to 15 billion is realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade, the money will be missing at other hubs and constraints on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at the time.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube right here.
However, the S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight traffic: in the heart of Europe.
Government is reviewing judgment on airport
In the Wiesbadener Landtag, the state government has left open whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally reviewed, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had on those days in writing substantiated that in the event of the construction of the planned northwestern runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23:00 and 5:00, as provided for by the state government, is not to be agreed with the protection of the population from nightly noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to review the ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged government representatives to refrain from a revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban, otherwise it would be considered a "word-break".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep your word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government trying to come to their night flights with "legal distortion and cheating".
An accurate legal examination will take your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legal certainty, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as she portrays the opposition, his group’s statements on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden U.S. big banks are stripping off their state barriers.
The Bank of America paid back the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp on Wednesday in the amount of a total of $45 billion (about 30 billion euros) in one blow.
And the Citigroup is also planning to refund state aid, according to a report by US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutes want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – for example, the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had taken care of about $19 billion of fresh money from investors through trekking loans.
They took the rest of the sum from their own cash register, which was well filled with savings sales, among other things.
Banking chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to free itself from its obligations to the state.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly $20 billion heavy capital boost, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Fast Elections
Then everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - officially, in order not to intervene in the procedure.
However, it may have also played a role in not harming ZDF-intendant Markus Schächter further, should this proposal also not be passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schaechter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of the drafting of this issue.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, Schaechter had failed in the board of directors.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him, while Brender's selection was a bitter defeat for Schaechter, but one was expected.
For weeks before the election, the majority of the Union in the Governing Council had signaled that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
Organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that, under Brender, the ZDF’s newscasts had lost their quotas, he declined a further term as the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was shattered.
Lately, even 35 state lawmakers had meddled in the debates, who judged Koch’s actions to be unconstitutional.
It has nothing to benefit from.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that, he worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey switched to the ZDF, initially to the "today newspaper".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal reporter of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint following the election of Brenders, who was still voted journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's opponent in the board of directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF state agreement so that the inmate's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an excerpt from party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever chess move - criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this record of journalistic independence, both Schachter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his sight and to elect the board of directors without suspecting a party candidate.
In party arithmetic, Frey is in any case attributed to the left-wing liberals.
Studying is being decapitated
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally joined on Thursday: at a meeting of ministers of culture and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the study conditions at bachelor and master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the exam burden: basically, each study module should only end with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and reasonable measure" is to be ensured.
In addition, politics and universities want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for undergraduate and master’s degree programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no deviating country rules.
Less Exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, cult ministers and university rectors have been carrying the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
For the first time, it was filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to partially drastically reduce the number of exams: “Each module usually ends with just one exam,” it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of coursework.
With the “significant reduction in the examination burden,” Reinhold Grimm, the chairman of the accreditation board, said a “developmental restraint that significantly impaired studentability” would be offered.
In addition, "studyability" is expected to be the "decisive criterion" in designing in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" if "unnecessary inputs from students in the choice of the
Events" would be avoided.
The students would be entitled "to receive playrooms that enable and promote own initiative".
The rules should apply for the admission of new courses of study, but also for the examination of existing courses of study.
These must be “re-accredited” every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 for all courses of study to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this, which are subject to the accreditation council set up by the countries.
The ministers of culture had urged the countries in October to “pressure” to influence the agencies so that the bulk of the material is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate provided additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are intended to set up tutoring programs and to strengthen study counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a novelle of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one exam is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to increase flexibility in the design of studies, to ensure the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country are to be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again disputed the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso Higher Education Groups called for the formation of education policy to no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also "talk a word" as the affected.
The future academics received support from the President of the Conference of Rectors of the University (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK discussed a common reform paper.
The Union of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough overall the Bonner decisions: it requires a legal claim that will allow every graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that there are enough master’s placements with the best possible study conditions for today’s generation of undergraduate students tomorrow, according to GEW’s board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and leaving is pretty much no control..." is the starting line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he in disturbing speeches thematicizes the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He provided considerable extraliterary attention last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of its security acts".
Söllner, visibly insecure and leaving behind a statement in which he admitted to Romanian German writer colleagues, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as an IM for the Romanian intelligence service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner had received the German Language Award in 1989.
Recruitment attempts had begun sluggishly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not defended himself enough against intimidation attempts by the Securitate."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that overwhelms the foundations and the despotism of a political system.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, according to Söllner’s confession, the literary scientist Michael Markel said, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He "exploded" him in all the points that were difficult for him at the time, Markel said.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate spikes, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, it may be suspected, are being speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
In contrast to the fact that the Stasi Acts are now very procedural in this country, the handling of the securitate surveillance agencies is still very diffuse.
Systematic education has been repulsed and impeded in recent years.
One of the National Council for the elaboration of the Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was established in 1999, but the issue of the acts has since been rather slow.
It was not until 2005 that there was a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview documented in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar abdicated about the award winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she has only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to express itself here in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the Söllner case, as so often in connection with hidden debt, raises inevitable questions.
The particular reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes it hopeful that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge pressure rather than by guilt and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation leaflet Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adrett-dressed outdoor serviceman from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sportswear manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, set up a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the striking smoothie was allowed to drive because of the town that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and luckily, the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but the work is going on in the morning.
Or just let it go.
In the words of the first three days previously committed Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the Ab.
The "much more important task" is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the Royal Class performance in the league everyday.
And to remove the re-discovered weaknesses after the quick three gates by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Lottery
The Champions League eighth final (innings 16/17. <0x2B> 23/24 February/backs 9/10. <0x2B> 16/17 March) will be played in Nyon on December 18.
So the joy of the fulminant stand of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only the supposed healer, who had conveyed self-confidence to the unsecured Stuttgarter professionals in a short period of time, willingness to work and joy in playing.
I went to the players and told them to think about their strengths, and stopped them from being braver, Soul Clamper Gross explained the simple-sounding success recipe, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has unraveled a certain magic, Babbel proponent Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes into football, sometimes things happen that one would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury breaks thanks to his dynamics, immediately advanced to the best player on the pitch, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new superior works: "He's a man who's long engaged and distracting.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns Sports Manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, players and managers also took care not to overestimate the victory against a weakened and completely overburdened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt said that while one season goal has been reached, the other one is still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt’s 40th birthday, even after the first home victory, had not been timed to celebrate for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a television interview broadcast immediately before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, countered Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of directors of leadership weakness and decided to change the coach at the pressure of puberty fans.
Also, that his free day had been cancelled after games, Lehmann considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure selfishness", he retorted and announced consequences for the final man.
You will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the preliminary work done by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combatively strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a large share of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
WM-Fight in Heavyweight
Hot Duel in Bern: Always challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judgement of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight boxing world champion.
On Saturday night in Bern, the 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance sheet to 39 victories in 41 professional matches, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre-long Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight primarily with his left hand.
However, the eleven centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly denied the World Champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he was only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had taken care of some vertebrae before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "evil zombie" who "can't do anything right".
While weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off the nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he had then beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained his "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States.
I only got one hit in this fight and I’m physically in very good shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Wladimir is the World Champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA wears the belt of the British David Haye after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre-long Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had earlier this summer canceled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
Apparently, his promotional company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest findings of the Kunduz airstrikes, the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said of the deadly bombardment of two September tanker cargo trains "knowingly the untruth," Green faction chief Jürgen Trittin said Saturday in the ARD news show "Day Show".
It’s called lying, he’s lying.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked cargo, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrikes requested by the German Kunduz commander Oberst Klein, up to 142 people had been killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the Chancellor’s Office, the Federal Army and the News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and fellow Greens colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s Office did not influence the Federal Army’s concrete operations in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the ministry’s presentation on the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and completely about the background of the tank truck attack.
Officially, it had said it had denied the existence of the NATO reports and deprived the minister of sensitive details.
However, from the background of the two top officials, it was alleged that they had even referred to several reports to the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by the commanding colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, he said.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday, pointing out that this will be clarified in the Investigative Committee of the Bundestag, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others don’t see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and in the case of drug smoke, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are free to give in to the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
However, those who experience growing traumatic states, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are often considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as a special someone.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the case of mentally ill people or in the case of drug noise.
Guilt has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness and reality blur.
Dreamfully altered states of alertness can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may vary, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic repression states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain’s neuronal messenger substances – mainly dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – is unbalanced and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and insane thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between madness and dream has been employed by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of irresistence with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the senses, with all the unimaginable.
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a step.
Behind him, winged devil-like figures with blood red, distorted frats, tooth-staining.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices roar from walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that bully and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a sling and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and lays the sling around his neck.
Jumped.
The sling dissolves.
That's supposed to be a lesson to you, the voices shouting in the drumming choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The imagery is a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common condition after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an over-excited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship, or persecution.
Particularly common is listening to voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the door to a flood of ideas and fantasies that arise from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Head of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenia is at the center of the event, everything has a oriented meaning to it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible for them, the cheating images are cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, “but the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis is basically preserved.”
The insane thoughts and hallucinations met in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to lose the reality relationship for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers estimate that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a mystery as to how the disorder of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at first over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role – stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychoses as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether fraudulent images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and carriers for ten years, last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompaniments of psychoses, but also of astonishingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to boxes, are composed of memory contents that are usually retained.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or insufficiently inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also attraction, stress, love resentment or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If only there were no pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a slender boy with long, dark hair speaks to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spoiled daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other cheating pictures are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are most frightening
Often, fraudulent images are also a burden.
When sitting in the classroom, she sometimes can’t follow the teaching material because the teacher is presenting a new fellow student in her eyes and ears, while explaining mathematical equations to everyone else, audible and visible on the board.
At night, the appearances are most frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often can’t tell whether she’s awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the frats or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, open or closed in front of her eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the characters.
Parents and friends don’t tell them anything that they think they’re crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from atrial fibrillation, they are most likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then under-employed and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, she often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls dad since she can think is not her dead father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain regions that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Each experience," says Kasten, " takes place in the brain, reality takes place there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to form, which is why they seem so real.”
Even nocturnal dream images value boxing as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations also as a special ability.
The boundary state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our overly conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Head of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative - madness is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide form of experience, a special form of dreamically altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and that he cannot distinguish from the waking state afterwards.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in patients with polyradiculitis who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world-loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality situation with his own, imaginary world detached from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the reality is presented in the imagination.
An intense form of foundation and devotion in a situation that is unbearable in itself, which allows us humans to have their own capacity to subside in nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Change of the Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplantation, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive care facility.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot wakes up about his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs from blood.
Trapped by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes on completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for clauses from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are still very clear to me after years and in extraordinarily detailed detail.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the box psychologist summarizes, “can lead to a distortion of what we call reality.”
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The Snow Breakdown May Come
Here.
Children should take over the publisher at 27 years old
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding is expected to belong to the family 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details for this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
You cannot introduce your children to 7,500 employees if they are not qualified enough.
It kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was resigning from the Board of Directors from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen was appointed as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury sector, the responsibility for the company’s assets came to this and after the removal of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also the one for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
In the future, the holding should still belong to 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure about the downfall: "This was always about families who could be infected by a capital addiction, who had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had “never had a world power dream,” Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political predator of this country as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the World League with ‘Time’, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is about body care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find among other reputable companies such as Hedonai, which provide hair removal with laser; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with rooms to relax and for beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with their gym or L'Occi mit Naturtik.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends on your feet and after that the spas can be enjoyed in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest face and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the customers’ training units and thus provide them with a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the gym ensures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have trained your body, you still want to visit the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments are offered to regain the beauty, shine and health of your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE-Büro" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE-Bureau" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and reach agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize the opinions and measures of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also taking part in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities that are related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa takes part in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, prophesied of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures that the Government has put in place to support the automotive sector during the Government year.
“Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have today a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants,” the president said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to produce in a very competitive industry in Spain in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our major export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to stimulate demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are applicable in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average 6% reduction in emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in permits, which increased "by 40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: environmentally friendly sportsmanship
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the Mazda3’s automatic engine stop and start system, named i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its stress behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Also, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Further looking at the unit, which consists of the dashboard and dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue, in line with the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the nudity of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive comfortably first.
To all this comes a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and drive system is only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearbox.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, by its silent noise, its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with gasoline engine because of its coarse comfort in the gearbox and its low consumption, even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the most sold.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the standard equipment stands out above all the assistant for the change of lane (RVM), which eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the Audio system, the Audio system, the light-sensitive interior mirrors and the Reo system, the on-board computer with a large screen.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the experimental model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars radiated, dressed in models that look as elegant as they look sexy, more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is primarily limited to a device with which you can only read your emails without being able to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five-minute fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more unlikely, but the idea itself is still of interest especially to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of the company, it has brought two new devices to the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six-times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to skip all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the country border or when you are desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to be able to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission regarding affordable roaming fares for the whole of Europe has almost always remained unnoticed.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it’s always amazing that it has the name Fon, even though it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer this type of rates means that phone providers can slowly but surely rethink and have to start considering different ways to take into account data like them.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other inquiries on the Internet.
Without sling and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, that is, when you buy it, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a shopping opportunity with lifelong internet access as Peek already offers in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his, undoubtedly, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: although it was almost the same color - a shiny greenish yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and in addition she wore a slightly coarse-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It goes so far as it seemed at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet dress in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with semi-high heels and for the second time, although a sloppy model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was raised on this occasion as a hair claw, the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
To this end comes the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market restricted due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not women work and if so, what kind of profession they engage in.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the home, only work half-days, or do not have a fixed-term employment contract, will be more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed employment, especially in the public sector, are moving the foundation of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after contraction, a number that has increased to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have contracted their first child and the first child has become much worse.
In addition, the type of work also has a major impact on maternity, albeit less than the calendar in terms of readiness for conception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only a bachelor’s degree or a higher education, on average, were mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
In addition, there is another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a master’s degree get married before their first fixed position and have their first child, the women with a high school degree do it exactly differently and only seek a fixed position and marry after it and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the widely known advertising "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at the international level, will become another famous pendant as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
For the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting colleague in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their top representatives – fashion designers and models from both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason, they all appeared.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicente presents in "Poker of the Ace" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) the three-dimensional X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a foreseeable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but instead searches for an affinity for the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicente spares neither horror nor illumination.
Auverre, that this book is a delightful reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: The joy in contrast to the unheilful fate".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, like the knives who almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was drawn into her flesh by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions were united by the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege to come to Him, to enter Heaven."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8,000 peaks in world literature, you have to climb on the north wall, on the wall, where you try again and again the best climbers."
About William Faulkner: "It was a funny caucus.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir to a county estate owner, and again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain amount of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane scream written out of a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo would go deep into the night of the 20th century in his own literary way, and he would go to the revelry in a way full of his own.
Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and said, ‘My God, I ask you to do everything in your power so I can finally stop writing like a woman.’”
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses engraved by Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spyed on them between the azaleas or the birds sang in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was far greater than her madness."
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do but try to involve Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet’s intention if he did not lead Baroya to Faulkner’s weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy that man’s glory, so that he could put himself on this podium?”
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went for a walk through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old came up next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixer, we took him out of the animal shelter with a sledgehammer and the one weighs two pounds.
Our discomfiture cannot be put into words, since it is incomprehensible to us, since the fun is supposed to be in the event of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation attack that a woman, who went for a walk comfortably, when she wanted to justify these people because of the incident, she even feared for their own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he himself, he may be the same with any man, a woman, a child.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been barking all day.
Of course, we have returned advertisements at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our dismay over what has happened has prompted us to point out this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety, which "entails far more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming safer with each day" and further confirmed that they also come up with other actions of an educational and informative nature to contribute to this goal.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will in a first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin emphasized that the company’s road safety is “a constant concern” and precisely because it, as a manufacturer of two-wheeler tyres, is always committed to ensuring that one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks are on the rise again.
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the company’s predecessors, the Gamhä Automobiler Anfac.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with greater caution, as the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of sales, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles consisting of the small transport market include: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vans and lighter small trucks/carriage.
In addition, the same storm clouds in the sky are still the ones that are most sympathetic to demand, because even though some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
Among these constraints, which are the result of the tightening of credit institutions, further factors must be included, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission that is not allowed to exceed 160 grams per mile driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had recalled that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealership association predicted for the year 2010 a similar year as the previous one, for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and off-road cars) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system back then, and as is now the case with the ESP stability control, the emergency braking assistance systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, for the rest of the vehicles a leave period was set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union is intended to improve the protection of pedestrians, but due to their operation, these braking systems can also help to prevent many collisions.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical braking maneuver which the system detects on the brake pedal on the basis of the brake strength carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collision no longer entered the brake pedal and half of them had not fully braked.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force into the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car places in the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistance.
There would be even fewer accidents – one expects one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury – once so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time already exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver reacts, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors postpones Opel plan to January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, it is likely that it will take time for the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the party concerned agrees to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be moved until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision will be made in the coming days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising, then, that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the skyper sports car, which has a back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more support.
If no agreement was reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to really make it 80 kilos lighter, bringing it to scale only 1,275 kilos now.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to give up the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent canopy with manual drive, so that only one saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, one of them was still able to "disappear" with the other 15; by the exception of the clamp 13, thanks to the one used in this model.
Then again, six kilos less had been achieved by giving up the audio system CDR-30 and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric, the missing kilo was reached.
Although it is also available with the dual-clutch transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed manual transmission vehicle, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curved.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the note impeccably.
However, the reduction in his weight did not in any way cause him to be no longer so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, but at the same time there is also a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the required time, until we give him the commands to shave, brake, recover and then again to get everything out of his engine...
The car does everything we tell him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been pronounced and can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as a system that can change the engine noise, which was already in use with the Panamera for the first time.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether it’s standing out or accelerating again.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already pretty damaged, but the car managed the punch holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that, although we found ice in the morning grey and roll split in the morning at some of these curves.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it is otherwise probably rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
"The bag girl"
The singer, a busty friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic clinic Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus came to the first place in his group in the best rating (after the great appearance of the Manrvi29 with the appearance of the Drec at Teleza Mirza).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and teamwork, even though they waited until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blues, who sat at the top of the board from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, it was already possible to predict that they had come to the playing field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an indoor game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with peppers and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already seemed to suggest that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was not decided yet and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of El<0xC3><0xAD>as" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
More Disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all but dead, had to prepare a few moves with rendezvous security to get back air and one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive stops of the three-times (with the help of the Gauhler) was again approached by the three-times, and with the support of the An, Vitafel, and Ribas.
The Alaves were bluffed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, not the best of their team, resigned and tried to give their team back strength by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitter was put off due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defending well and although the Israelis still recovered in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to resign the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, in a game characterized by the failures of Unicajas players (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the domestic game, which he led the Greeks to win.
The team from M<0xC3><0xA1>laga was neither afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
The Andalusians started to dream, with an aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja era, although the local team with an indoor match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to make the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22-20 William was shown in their favor, the minute we were weighing in and the minute it was dissatisfied between an action to beat America.
The Greek team finally began to get hot and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the elimination of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three errors caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear marks at Unicaja.
Among their insiders and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their lead in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A hunt was impossible.
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to make up for the difference of the game played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the lead to fluctuate within the group.
Unicaja tried to get away from the many failures and the elimination of the injured Scot Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many drawbacks for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to Cook's suspension and triples and Lewis's use, there was some hope at 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket realm, was not to brake.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give up and had to resign the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now learn about their salary thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most listings of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on the more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form in Facebook, in which they can enter their profession, professional experience , age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average feels "badly paid," Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera, said in a press release.
The Spaniards are the poorest paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, in contrast to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time job and social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his term of office expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV broadcaster Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the message he had found since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, as his term of office expires on that day and he must look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to obtain refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed in Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the “de facto” government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the predominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about nature.
The assumption used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave liquidity free at interest rates that move around zero, so that banks can buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, begin to spread some sand into gear, as the ECB has already done with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors are doubting the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bonus differences are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize the private risks and the state debts were rising again.
We are now back on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability so far, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not hurt in order to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused Dan, because they should have deviated from the destructive effects of their own actions, as they have deviated from the destructive effects of their own actions, to those of which they have spoken.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the emirate to restore power in the emirate, and the development in Greece was also anticipated earlier.
A government that silences public debt, elections, and a new government that draws on the same string.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus admits to a Euro Member State not to comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the obligation to maintain the stability of state funds when it is necessary to take extraordinary measures.
Yes, we are, as expected, ahead of an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some delays on too high amounts, that would now be within expectations.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonds.
However, if the European differences were to be reduced and the Spaniards increased further, then this would be a specific Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a majority of market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their 2011 scenarios upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission's long-running economies, do not spawn the afterlife that was once again with a Japanese scissors.
Again, it all seems like it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "be careful when driving".
Connected Branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to appear before Parliament’s sub-committee yesterday, where the strategy on Spain’s energy supply is being debated in these days over the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press some hints about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 from this date until 2030, on the condition that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for capturing carbon dioxide and, of course, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the precondition of course by other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who is of the opinion that the bill for a sustainable economy just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, such as to create incentives for national coal consumption, which is exactly the opposite of all policies.
In his opinion, "there is a clear long-term focus on this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as she called the chairman of Iberdrola.
Whatever it is, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that decisions on investments should already be made, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework needs to be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage services at ten European airports where it is represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been announced, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation center for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with High Depth and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction in question is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the Administration for a Public-Private Cooperation (PPP) decided to move the project forward according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the Administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in deep construction.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O’Rourke, the Australian Transfield responsible for infrastructure and the French Baugruppe Bouygues, joins the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), which also owns the local company Baulderstone (owned by the German company Baerfinger).
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction work and privatizations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as you only get access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30 % stake in High Deep, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is committed to this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its large wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The subterranean toll line, which is promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and will be called Northern Link (Northern Transporter), is intended to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres to take the road from Madu to Madu.
The schedule issued by the city administration foresees the allocation for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is expected to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the funding.
For high-deep Brisbane is ready for big business.
Australia, which signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday, repeatedly grants high-profile orders.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber-optic cables through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and has received 129 million for this.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives order for a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has acquired the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the grant for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore Receives Advertisement Award from Renfe
Renfe has allocated the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company said.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, which presented to this competition, which was awarded by Renfe, of which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible in the last three years for the promotion.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing the campaigns.
A fine of over 63 million for France Télécom for failing to compete.
France’s competition regulator France Télécom has imposed a fine of 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean territories belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the verge of regulation.
Along with this sanction, the former French monopoly and state-owned company has accumulated more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for impeding its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority that is watching over the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and therefore has become reversible again.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet for the purpose of increasing revenues from transactions that do not derive from the telephone connection.
Basically, this Orange application website is active in France and the UK.
You have to wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League game has brought in 476.4 million in Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since the start.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of income for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, bringing them the third and fifth places of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of the major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish), who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is the third place in Europe that has earned the most money through its participation and the only one to win the trophy three times in addition to AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is in fifth place.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also received the most money by their participation in the previous Champions League.
And that, even though they lost against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the countries that were able to take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than any other (five, as opposed to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution (distribution)
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1.090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for a game received 3.8 million due to their bluffing presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and for a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 per team). The clubs that have reached the eighth final will receive three million each; the four that have reached the quarterfinals will receive 3.3 million.
The last four receive 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who gets 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed income.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>337.8 million is foreseen.
This money will be awarded in proportion to the value of each individual TV market.
The Spaniard is one of the first and has four seats.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The second part will be distributed depending on the number of games you play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in sauces
The Nueva Rumasa Group has yesterday leaked details about the purchase offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire an upper limit between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which are paid out over ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per annum due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuern Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to notify them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
Upon completion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the sidelines of possible purchase offers and the judicial turmoil of his former managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of the internal audit.
A decision that will make her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all other than free from controversy, because the company is involved in a court battle on suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar’s loan, yesterday ex-advisors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public tender for the exclusion of Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer

CNMV also announced that this offer aims to acquire 550,08 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn represents 8.95 % of the share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the tender and the price of which was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New Programmes for the Evaluation of Vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an assessor has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the reviewers use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process it thereafter and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are made with their products.
The other two companies that compete with the tool market for reviewing and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each providing the information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed is growing, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the business starts to work.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be cataloged and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week, if the process proceeds quickly.
When it comes to a less common car, it can take up to three or four months.Audatex currently has complete information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet of vehicles driving on the roads, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) distributed for the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and the production of databases, and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, they collect 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the fault or residual value of a car, depending on the country.
The only company that informs about a driver about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products being a standard solution for assessing accidents.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the lacquering prices.
This tool is paid for depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each review.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
In contrast, every insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting tape, using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle disks, and AudaSubastas is an Internet service open to the specialist market that can be used to offer vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go into the workshop due to faults or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and delivers in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing damage, faults or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for reviews is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 consultants and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% year-on-year in the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to sources of the company, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, of which 3,000 in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Auctioning of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, Solera Autoonline bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and increase in value, with the ability to gain access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, assessors, car rental companies, workshops, landfills and car dealers, who need to be registered before their activities.
Founded in Germany in 1996, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a vehicle whose chassis number has been registered may no longer be driven on the road, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
Cars of historical value, on the other hand, may be re-approved even if they have been recalled after difficult government procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small trucks and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graph of the respective model appears and the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts and after that he can have the cost estimate printed and pass on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for reviewing like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not involve estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
At the moment, the company Audatex is working to be able to offer these images also in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, as you can choose a door with it, for example, and then completely rotate the image to look at the inside.
