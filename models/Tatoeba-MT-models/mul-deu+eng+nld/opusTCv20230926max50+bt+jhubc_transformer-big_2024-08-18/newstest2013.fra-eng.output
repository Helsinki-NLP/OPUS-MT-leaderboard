A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments have enacted new laws starting in 2009 that make the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods by anticipation, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the vote and withdraw citizens with a judicial record from their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Québec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a piece of identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required ID card with a photo.
That's a lot more.
Students, who are considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their ID card with a photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on the day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voters' registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
However, measures taken since 2009 have reduced the enrollment rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states to reduce the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in anticipation were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of state voters.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, represented only 46% of the electorate voting in anticipation.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the pro-laws that have been voted on and see it as an obvious goal to influence results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to undergo screening tests even more hesitant?
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that one is between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if one is not detected.
So I recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and rather, in these cases, opting for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to have active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding which should or should not be dealt with are precisely determined.
I recommend that you pass the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many of them are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This has a huge impact on people’s health.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Québec today,” says spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after quitting cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Bone point and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular exercise throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” he added.
L'entertainment
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of having colorectal cancer.
The charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs boson decorticated
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created an entire emotion, last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain whether it is Higgs.
It is known without a shadow of a doubt that one holds an authentic new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely sure.
Let’s assume it’s the Higgs anyway, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and let’s see what it’s all about.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally unavoidable law that wants that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
But even if the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting of certain coarse ways.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other are the bosses, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they may well be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the boson of Higgs would appear.
These bosses, we have to point out here, are not all animals as exotic as you might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, this "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at this specific location, somewhat like a slurry thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More Stable Field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a bit like it was a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, yours) do not.
Now, what "can" all this research bring, Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to check any discrepancies between observations and predictions of MS.
In fact, there are many who would like to be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physical" and clog some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, proposing no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But no such gaps have been found at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Keep in mind: in the very early 1960s, the pioneers of laser technology at Bell Laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They saw scientific applications of it, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was seen as a "lab gadget".
Just imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although not his original intention at all, now serves as an eye for all digital cameras in the world, and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... <0x7C> The Duty
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this crucial area, however, much remains to be done.
The Duty tried to look at it more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that swallowed him had left him a two-year rest.
“They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old,” he says, half fig half-root, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Set in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to strangers who bothered him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
“During our lives, we learn that a man is pissing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For 89-year-old A., the worst fear is to die “consciously and suffocated.”
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t have any more wishes in life,” she says, before accepting that she’s wearing a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she expects a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we perform, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At the time of death, we will agree to provide oral care to brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois’ home, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Alongside an old 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the yard, well-knitted in his pillows while dripping in his honor, a young 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything for him.
“For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de care palliatives domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in health care in Quebec that causes several doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that frames euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care summits including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Québec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid that patients just ask to die because they don't get the right care.
And at the same time, several oncologists harness their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helene Richard's hopes of survival were already minimal when she abandoned a probing chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting.
And yet, she told me I was done!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank caregivers for not accessing their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society of Palliative Care at Home in Greater Montreal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is used to put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelievable patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible through a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Québec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell us day by day what they know of a formidable “system”, mixing building industry, civil servants, politicians, unionists and mafioso.
An "industry " that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system has been exhausting since we took the big money,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Québec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation of the violations related to road works contracts in Québec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to backtracking.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and civil servants corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only Department of Transportation would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” some repressing their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission “already dropped two mayors,” he added, hoping that it could “demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the police of "l'escouade Marteau" who, since 2009, reportedly led the "Cartel des sewers" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the contract swellings...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third city in Quebec.
He is suspected of embezzling repetitive wine pots in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers on the Montreal road and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accuras and Lino Zambito.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-linked intermediary who was returning the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito seeded all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially liberals then in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts for sewage whose costs were inflated
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked roughly.
Gilles Surprising, a former engineer in public works, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and wine pots totalling $736,000, in exchange for contracts.
Other road officials have admitted to having the leg grease by inflating 30% to 40% of the bills, by fake extras.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal elected to fire the alarm bell.
The mayor of the district of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, east of the island, it revolted in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the middle of a real estate boom.
70% of the money is dirty in the election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "drawn on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pinch the faults."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We're clearing the wound, but it would take Montreal's own investigative unit and a day off, so as not to see dubious practices come back.
Like we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, for his part, that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but is especially concerned about the role of “elects aware of the stratagem”, when they did not immerse themselves in the magic!
Estimating 70% of the share of dirty money in the funding of the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the way they do, he said: "As long as we don't strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocated a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We can't go lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story spoils the international image of Québec and Montréal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at it in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you’ve taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements drive me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything is going very quickly in football.
But I don't light up.
From my early days at the INF Clairefontaine preformation centre to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed through stages.
So you benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Oh, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with clubs hupped up.
He's been with some great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a reassuring conversation with him.
Then I came out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still stuck.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we’re really looking forward to winning this title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you are supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it's certainly a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people are waiting for more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team builds with time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer present.
Look at Manchester City who haven’t qualified for the finals in two seasons, they’ve also made a lot of money!
In view of the sums invested, you were imagining with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s exploits.
All the better if we say that there is a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performant and sets a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves he is the star of League One.
He proved everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, the man and the player are respected.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playing time.
I saw things out there, and I got out strengthened.
Today, I am able to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my Baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and we have to be exemplary today.
What look do you have on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the bon null (1-1) ripped off on October 16th in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everybody's been fighting for everybody.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
All the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pair to pair.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a peak of $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning around ten dollars today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive compared to global exchanges in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competitive with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account book depositors, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner of which, sort of a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file hashing, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hiking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a margin of ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computational power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The fault used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on money laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Actors of weight such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giant soldiers” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes a lot about the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which return less expensive.
The carrier further manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement with merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is communicate an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left from Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban detachment to Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join forces in a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, seizing government land to resell them in land to build to refugees coming from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They were disrespectful; most of them did not fight on their own.
People, as I heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have been able to benefit from the American breadth will leave: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that are going to command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with the reconstitution of provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and much earlier.
No industry has been reopened, no dam is in good condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
It has been rumored that Afghanistan possesses immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the West was only there to take over.
Without energy to process the iron ore ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search the immense Buddhist site and remain the province’s largest employers.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of making aids and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civilo-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, has led, and led to the well of the collection of small French NGOs.
These works, local labor gourmets, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in arable areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, very harsh in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests from small-scale agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa Province.
In order for them to get rid of the insurrection led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me to wish for, a small, well-controlled and directly affected civil aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker shot from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its part.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given this Assembly an additional two months to complete its work.
It is soon two years since Egypt relies on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "travel his word" and "peet the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The ultimatum to the Egyptian people is, “Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers,” which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, believing they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, substitute members, were added in haste, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
Commentators also had fun with the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee deemed the constituent’s pendulum to be poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, has 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals reply, who see only a smash of communication.
For, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The liberals’ fears are further fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not oulémas but academics, for some trained in the French system "temporary Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used are derived from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could in the future arise as to the extent to which the civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extended powers it accords to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more than civilian trials in military courts will be banned, as requested by the human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider libertarian.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now banned, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article reflects on the protection of women, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, protests are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will parade them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the World and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has given you five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Make yourself unmissable: the shores of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptismal depths" will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is at this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers go through the Rue de la Sufferance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoria), where the trial took place, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the anointing and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world is located, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected in the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place of the Jews: the Lamentation Wall, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave there small words accompanied by prayers that are then heard.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the summit of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
The country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all in a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (the parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumr<0xC3><0xA2>n, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also see: the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly exhibits the canvases of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moulds of visitors and observers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Rally Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children’s memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter into total darkness.
Stars are sparkling.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
The three major resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21<0xC2><0xB0>C while the air temperature can reach 23<0xC2><0xB0>C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come here to perform a treatment based on salt water, lemon, healing mud and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquity
They are kept by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he himself lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to stroll in the narrow streets that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet young brides who came to take photo shoots from all of Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The trip in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease to operate.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a variety of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hops, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk in the high air.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These cats love passing places and don't refuse to be entertained.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 per day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, to Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are debating what the mandatory language test law will bring, fraudsters selling “fake” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to make money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
For the time being, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sector.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the legal foundations.
You will need to validate your Russian language skills in order to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or diplomas of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, Negative Attitude and Protection of Rights
The network of examination centers will be under the aegis of the Russian Language Institute of Pushkin, the University of People's Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened across the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, according to the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, says Victor Sebelev, director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for 14 days with no food and no paper.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are misled, they are taken their passports, and they do not touch the expected salary,” Tolib Charipov, head of the Tajik Migration Service, said in a statement.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to come and make money in Russia trust that they not only know not the language of the country they want to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have anything to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start making money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and enamored."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the law on language.
Examinations will be directed only to migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work afterwards.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Defense to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles of rubles.
And then, you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Tajik-born journalist Oumed Khoukkadamov told reporters.
"Do it quickly, don't hurt yourself and buy yourself a beautiful work of art."
From the first day of the entry into force of the Law on Language, it was discovered that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Forged papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper sticks".
Authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to pass the first-time exam time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tighten the law against civilian weapons carriers.
Such is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it be the shootings at weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven.
Police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullet guns in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun license by increasing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Weapons Act would be introduced to the State Douma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "clamping the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this nonsense hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of the laws on civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market for weapons is supplied via several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who has served for ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking command of weapons
The first is the "military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by law enforcement criminals.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often been subjected to explosions.
“Verified versions indicate that some fires have been purposely triggered to cover up the deficit,” the former military official said.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private arms factories that do not compete with the international market and arms are running out of the black market, especially in Moscow,” one expert said.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia formed and organized the supply,” adds the former military.
Where did the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts have analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found to be “due to employees whose work is related to weapons,” the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from " clandestine looting".
A salesman and consultant at an armory who has asked to remain anonymous ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these specialists in the clandestine excavation; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person purchases a unit through a sign, such as an TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a grid.
"He transports it in the city and sells it for 900 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> per unit with two chargers," he says.
“It’s true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be cleared, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers,” he added.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone was going to take me to a "coin" to trade.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets as military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you also have to come by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I will not give them.
Young people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s as he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album with "everything we want."
“I thought I was in a luxury store,” the soldier recalls.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, you can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, we go with the seller in the forest and we install a target.
“I get fired and when I’m convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating,” he said.
A shop from her couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, you don't need any documents and no one to meet.
“It’s enough to have a specific amount of money,” the advertisement reads on the website, “Buy a gun or a combat machine gun.”
Users leave their request there and ask their questions.
Are we selling to minors?
"Without permission, of course," the user asks "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has deployed a huge network of fake sites and is picking up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People are rubbing themselves on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard about this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take over the command.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the "Right to a weapon" association, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without a weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has deployed a huge network of fake sites and is picking up people who want to buy combat weapons.
“People are rubbing themselves on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia,” he said.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It was released from long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes overall decreased in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: Fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a job as a cashier at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow or suffocate quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Alongside the rise in modest salaries received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the events want the creation of unions.
At the moment, this sector is not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the “Black Friday,” at a time when a pouring rain of salaries taking hold of millions of people hit America and sometimes triggered landslides.
That day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their positions to organize strike pickets with trade unions and leftist activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and medium classes.
Walmart sells everything from layers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid employees at Walmart do their shopping only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants in the “Black Friday” demonstrations demanded a salary increase, complaining that the price of the company’s medical insurance had risen from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who touches $9.5 an hour, it's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average hourly wage to $12, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart were to transfer the entire increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8:00 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second over that period.
His cash registers made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
Company spokesperson Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the Huffington Post website that at least "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only an "operation of com' among so many others" by the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not much appreciated, which is why they are not yet located there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces selling billions of servings and after they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase them over time, but little, on average, its core employees reach New York City for $8.90 an hour.
Nobody touches less than them in this city.
It is inconceivable for me to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living at their parents' home.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, there are comments on the Wall Street Journal forum saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald’s on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food chefs be paid at least $15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters by beatings or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, getting fast food is still a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of the staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day gathering near the McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces you're selling billions of servings!" and after they don't even give you bad.
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, including the candidate for mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we all need to support fast food employees in order for them to get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event the fast food industry has seen in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not counting that not all were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say at the moment whether this spark of mass movement will make small.
“For the moment, we can only get the brain wrong on average.”
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, the interview with Shahram Izadi, director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, shows that for the company’s scientists, the glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained at the moment at the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in controlling by the gesture.
- What does the future also hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, is not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on real 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
It is necessary to bring out the computer world in our own, in the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
In this way, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She is appreciated, but isn’t she overestimated?
One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of privacy arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a hand-carried bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture <0x2B> voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, do you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or can't do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It can be for example laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If you are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely on in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are pretty good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory gave the sensor touch a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would certainly need such a device in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames per second.
Shouldn’t we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the camera curve and see how it could help define locations.
“As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, strolling all the time with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (personal elements are the only ones you see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What responses is your group preparing for this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to give tangibility to these "air images": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him believe he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still one task down there that will still take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of treadmills too.
At the moment, we can only moderately mislead the brain, there is still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the city dwellers who are at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city frontier and have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the popular parties and varnishes.
The paintings of Kirill Miller still gather the crowds, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of Petersburg's fundamentally social and philosophical storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took into his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image as a Bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of the image and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I realized that was my way.
So the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
- And all this was in your Artistic Clinic... - It was important for me to be in the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playback in molding shirts, they included among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion.
When the band began to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg had quite a few shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was at our house that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are the repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees have gone there as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that's when my reign came to an end.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a culture person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and sharpness.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything erases, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, one is interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we need to spit on his trunk.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- We recently saw you as the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today the commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liquorous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Previously, people were divided into herds, bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
“These are people we’ve thrown out who come to see it, it’s the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and in the end it's less management, less money, it's all gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones you paint at the end of your life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is a spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday’s culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- They're good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not like this, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are dismissed, as it takes higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and set them apart.
At present, it is the "kingdom of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must be in other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who are going to see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very fine.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project realized with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Childbirth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with aliens on board leave in search of a rescue planet.
In order to save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in weight or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500 .
You can only live there at very high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then we put insects into orbit, small breeding drosophile flies.
In 1979, cauliflower eggs were sent into space to see how a heavier embryo developed.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
Then, the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, he has to get on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks were in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to either light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We peeled their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a thin case.
By losing their habitual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable of this, in principle.
The Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been going into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has the most precious.
Our fly flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
"No one answered this question," said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space worker.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been in orbit twice and even worked in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few, cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train for extra-vehicle exits.
Water mimics weight.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
The amphibious little men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid in his mother’s stomach, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
This is logical in principle, because from birth until its first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weight is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In heaviness, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
You can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite him to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the attraction of the earth, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can’t dress an infant like an adult with a special workout combination.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a child with a disability, completely disabled," says the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC said: "The control of pseudo-independent work (in Czech " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution of Public Finance Control, said in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that’s what’s lacking in us,” Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint check carried out by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as ' approach to the " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system " .
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG was not going to harm entrepreneurs with controls; is this allowed or prohibited?
“The law has to be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can’t stop acting an authority in charge of inspecting the law,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was the concrete question about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a specific practice, follow it.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure is not yet completed, we have found very interesting differences: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more stringent and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continually develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project do for you and what does it do for you?
A joint control of this kind should precisely help us stop trying to clarify the laws, lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not really have a positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It is possible that this system is so submerged by the paperwork that those looking for its flaws will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
As for institutions, like the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is similarly organized, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in an analogous way.
Skills are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance, however, in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has courses of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to state resources in our country.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the accounts of the Länder.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Is it because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I have no comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we see as a model is also facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has meant for you as an institution the amendment to the Public Procurement Act, are its effects already felt?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it still has no impact on our control operations.
As we do back-to-back checks, we have to wait a bit longer.
Our observations concern, for the time being, only the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detecting the risks of mismanagement" with which we have passed the screening of nearly 14,000 public contracts - where these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds and the conditions of certain types of procedures have been changed.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an extra burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) obliged the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the law on the market was a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really helpful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without having an impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He may state, “We will change the law and allow it,” but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing were.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be fulfilled, precisely in order to protect the tendering process.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are freezing, but most remain practicable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were practicable this morning, but in cold and also snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and fluctuate between -5<0xC2><0xB0>C and -10<0xC2><0xB0>C but they should rise slightly in the day.
The snowfall has stopped in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service showed that due to the fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 expressway and the national roads of the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be put on, for example, on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still snow remains on some of their sections, frozen and traffic jams.
Especially in areas at altitude, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by glaciation and that traffic-laden snow can be found on roads in mountainous areas located at altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risks of glaciation in the areas of the Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be frost in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic jammed snow is present on the roads in the areas located at altitude.
In East Bohemia today it will be overcast, but mainly dry for a while.
It will blow a small wind and temperatures will usually range between -3<0xC2><0xB0> and <0x2B>1<0xC2><0xB0> C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although, in some places, greater vigilance is needed and its behaviour is adapted to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 <0xC2><0xB0> and -9 <0xC2><0xB0> C.
After the last snowfalls and the cooling that followed, some communication paths may be by frozen places.
Drivers can expect to pass through fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is evident from the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is practicable almost without difficulty, however, road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The lining of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third-category routes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less frequent roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region located at altitude must now have a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> kr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field that night; according to the services in charge of the road, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the footpaths are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk are snow remains.
Drivers driving towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k must expect to meet at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass a thick and soft layer of snow ", the head of road maintenance services of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues from the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also visited the site overnight; according to them, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are practicable without difficulty, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk, however, drivers should pay attention in sections in forest areas with slippers remaining wet.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, North Bohemia road maintenance services have reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially to the south-east of the Bohemia Central Plateau, there is no problem, on the contrary, and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of glaciers, especially around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and melting snow during the day, clear sky and freezing at night.
Difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec are also reported from the main traffic routes.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of the snow until reaching the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to gather positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and say that we are the only group able to gather a positive energy to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charity action that we have been preparing for the past two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11 a.m.
On the eve of December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost as soon as the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, located in the Pacific Ocean, ends at a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a collection of unique items including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world titled "End of the world annulled " (in Czech " Konec sv<0xC4><0x9B>ta zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will you hear it at these charity concerts too?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point as part of a completely unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charity events...
We strive to make them participate intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the framework of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the association Tap, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers perform on stage during each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will stage Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega events” of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; also there, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic home in New York and personally, once on the spot in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalistic, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like it at first.
We have five electric chair members whose gears must travel in support, of course we also pack a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has been more or less always going well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we came back recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility facilities for people with reduced mobility, public opinion attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that everyone in the east is only in the initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the city center.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What else do we have to do to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere.
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a musical activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we have lost some control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I’m not mistaken.
It’s true, building links with well-known singers and actively working on promoting the band has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's subsidies, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But compassion is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take in pity.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it’s not just an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to our house with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
A single, La<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come in and go out, there's nothing we can do.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 starting at 9 p.m.
The event will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the Cancelled World" will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to raise financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional training center Studeo located in Prague at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had entered into close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed, participated in a number of ESA projects.
However, the journey from Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, enthusiastic Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, on December 6, 1933, in which he presented ideas drawn from his cutting-edge book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The development of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the auditors cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work Introduction to Astronautics.
This doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of the world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
In 1925, a draisin was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the draisin.
The only information known about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
Beginning in 1933, Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is apparent from the preserved documents that this research had reached the trial stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliiwy-Krzylock.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Probleme, which contains four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the space research field had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and from the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1,800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed just under 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was later built, and during the summer of 1959, two-story RM-2 missile flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeding the first RM missiles.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of engines was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in the space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Utility Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on works of public utility.
This decision has raised a lively debate in the public eye.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more than unregulated economic competition.
This means concretely that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with one another.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital, allied with ephemeral financial speculation.
Significant differences in labour prices (salaries) generate price tensions.
The following meaning should be added to this term: a producer strives by importing low-budget goods to resist economic competition by "making" the price of the competitor more expensive, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy cheaply, or disappear, resulting in significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no liability to the unemployment it generates, the social burden of the state necessarily increases.
All of this intensifies the complete unwillingness of gentlemen to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damages caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the various economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments place their own populations at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to force economically its own population to accept the dictates of the prices of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This occurs on the one hand through a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other hand through the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and the deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the RFA, there have been food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot support their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a surcharge in order to reach the minimum living wage.
Such a scandal has been updated, for example, in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern EU Member States generate, without a doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in their own country in the 19th century), or to live with wages of misery, in the margin of society.
The question must be asked here: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, getting tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
One must then wonder whether private capital does not influence and even does not today, according to its own selfish interests, govern politics and, by the same token, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is an almost omnipotent lobby that is present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the FRA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of bills to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-style constitutions state, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberalist democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianus in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state was long in delicacy and functions were attributed to violence.
The pot-of-win, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The absolute under-table and corruption proliferated indefinitely and the people went to the elections with votes already sold" ... ... "Honest people did not seek at all to obtain functions, it resulted in it once the state had transformed it's 8 months 'without consuls'. ... 'It really began to say that the remedy to this situation was a difficult one.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard to the interest of the society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as before, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the scrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises we witness today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utility Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and at the internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratories of Chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of violence and never can,” Sting said in the song titled Fragile, whose main verse of the chorus is “Let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurring killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the Autonomous Territories, were born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain", on that which mainly benefits from the tensions that have been going on for more than 95 years (starting with the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others come from my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In every era, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to pre-defined goals.
We must admit that we are living in an age where global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been possible in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the work (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course you do.
From the 1990s onwards, they acquired the world’s first news agency (Reuters) to end the connection between their name and serious criminal acts they were involved in, which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries under the control of Russia was 7, after the invasion of Iraq's Ruse 4, after the invasion of Iraq's 5, after the overthrow of Ka).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew at the Bank of America of the Rothschilds the status of central bank and began to issue his own money (government, I understand) during the civil war and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing own money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to file a lawsuit against the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at a global level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second had to abolish colonialism, in particular British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (so many slaves were able to take over, so that they were able to absolve themselves of their own luxury and comfort), and to create a universal religion.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the Fed to avoid the recurrence of crises such as those they provoked in 1907).
After successfully triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
In order to facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed to Germany terrible reparations of war thus generating the conditions of a radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then gave them a suffice to place a sufficient leader.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were perpetrated on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the European Jews in the world community in the concentration camps created the basis of juception.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel lit a fire that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (it is enough to see how people divide sharply between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where evil breeds another evil according to an endless cycle of violence and where, at the root of everything, there is the greed of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
Here we have to make a distinction between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers only propose to the people in elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the accession of this country to the cooperation organization of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.).
In the light of what David Rockefeller said in 1994: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a fully controlled being.
Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to wear a red-iron mark on the hand or on the forehead, so that he cannot buy or sell anyone who does not bear the name of this wild beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the one who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamist students attacked the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further exacerbated later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The captured diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated journeys, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rocambolesque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a filming team who came to make footage for filming a large-scale sci-fi film.
Combination of genders
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized department stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a success, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiances follow: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the era of events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were rewritten in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has been able to re-launch his career remarkably.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his role as an actor ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not to take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered only a few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He does well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a phone call in America and the chase on the runway by landing are.
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, enjoying the realisation and retro style of the 1970s.
It draws the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the business.
Rules for Inflating Balloons, Bananas and Circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to launch the contest of the settlement or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of major European companies has been at the root of our decision," said the organizer of the survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of mercury in the form of a directive, or because they contain a relatively small amount of mercury in the form of a substance.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter to be retained" or the withdrawal from the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose claims are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic currently imposes the claims of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Standards on fruit and vegetables have been softened despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize will be awarded in this survey to last year’s EU regulation that should include on inflatable balloons a warning that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a U.S. investigation that balloons are among the primary causes of deaths of children due to strangulation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire", which includes liberal economists, the Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server has named in this investigation, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the Union regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volumes for canned mushrooms and risked, therefore, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this investigation found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
However, these ideas do not originate from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had subsequently had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x83>mec (US-DEU), these were to be used, in concrete terms, to draw up applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Bizarre regulations are rare".
While the regulations often provoke criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and in the area of its overall development are rather commendable.
More serious, for example, according to the experts, is the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle which it is not always a winner) arouses strong emotions in the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" that dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, today we find in the company of world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck or Parmesan ham, Karlovy Vary ("Karlovy Vary") ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carps of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> ("T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>").
Pardubice bread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> pern<0xC3><0xAD>k") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice cornets" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how do we get the idea to run in the presidential election?
It's not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can’t stand to see how the country has been pillaged over the last twenty years, that thieves are not under lockdowns and taxes and retirement age are rising.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, then I try to come up with a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and an independent member of any party, I have no other way of influencing the situation than to present myself in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said I'll start the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate election.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not the function, it is just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we rush to the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we cough those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people’s reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I love journalists or that I was Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek's adviser.
Let's get to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of the tangible and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
To this end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pressed for the tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorisation and dogma supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself more like a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people rather like me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we are moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or SDGs, and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer to them.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of the parliament, you only have slogans.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to bring them to my camp to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to parliamentary party presidents to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they don’t want it.
When there will be a strong personality who will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct vote, it was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without hesitation, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I’ve just started politics and I’m trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to get things going, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that no one person can make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to come to the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who revealed the mazout fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you considering starting your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if each potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million worth of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I've always loved James Bond, who was driving in a car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a $60 million fortune and you don’t have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be indebted?
I've already invested two and a half million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows well that my program does not arouse much interest.
I have no obligation to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the salary I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn’t live with it, for example, paying my son’s English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I wouldn’t run for election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your business in jeopardy?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Pr<0xC3><0xA1>va.
The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that true adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To be convinced, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, it's finally something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the lower side of the street, told us.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large nearby company, tells us: “Yes, it’s actually beautiful, this building.”
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is going to enjoy it in one of these ringard libraries anymore, is it?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing to do with attraction at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architects’ office in Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of mind-filled and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with her usual phlegm and presented herself at the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a visa.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, disconcerted and shrugging, Maas, the confronted, piled up his books of choice in order to make them into a pyramid, and ended his speech backed by activist arguments by a "common dear one!"
Here is my proposal for the Spijkenisse book mountain, or, as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain fell from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
This is how this tiny small village, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall with an astounding ugliness, whose white facades invite to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched with an architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Sure, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you dig the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant reverbs speak unambiguously the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban ambience is perfect.
We are already looking for public banks, dogs and little boys and girls playing the ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, library rays are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Willy Maas.
We completely disrupted the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been properly designed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes slabs, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stairways.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the hardened architects and engineers of the building do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found ad hoc agricultural waste in a Frisian farm.
In the Netherlands, a one millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields for years.
It's cheap and you save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwkunst" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but above all they contribute to maintaining the ideal humidity level of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on good weather days.
The thick wooden beams mounted crosswise with respect to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting much of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even described the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally found soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure helped fill the gaps in the library that were not yet fully stocked (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For the architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians’ request to obtain observer state status with the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
What's that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so-called defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, as in France or in Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and the abstaining from the vote of the United Nations?
Germany has, first of all, important outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is, without a doubt, a crucial element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is at least a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration secretly demonstrates a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But given the country’s political configuration, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the true differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem to be so.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you’ll notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Is Germany having difficulty reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things any easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore fit into a broader political line and must assert their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing on the issue of the euro.
In my view, Germany will take on a role as a locomotive in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that more marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, does Germany only want to take on a key role?
Or does she always have a hard time taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it’s always the same problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with neighbors and very varied opinions, and it's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this gap, so what is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don’t like it, even if it’s unpleasant to them and they’re only less appreciated, it’s life!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot complain.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause gain.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to be able to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copying themselves, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook in which the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zegna DF Puma brand, a designation that the firm artificially created by taking part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: his clients are charged with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a relative brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are referred to as marrying rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to complain about.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China, with an annual volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion, is the world’s third fastest growing market for luxury products.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious registrations from the trade mark register and these procedures are costly.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports of the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the criticized designation had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism, as he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo acquirer, used a blue and white logo that resembled that of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to the Hong Kong and Singapore plagiarisms who had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the agency reportedly passed last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a recovered normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain unaffected at the office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the agency, this is a record and this means that China is at the top of the ranking for the tenth consecutive time for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of enrolment rights.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese plagiarism.
Indeed, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because last names cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the Munich objection.
Freudenberg, of course, won in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is a must
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, time-consuming and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the Archives Service has even had to review the acts of the past hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "big six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
“That’s where we see what that means for us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected trade marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “Vigilance is at stake.”
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
According to them, it is not enough to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "register in China also everything that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or else we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: tapping your foot, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans in Swaziland are delighted to have come.
Here is the story of a link that goes far beyond a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, one taps the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, boots for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the vocals of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they overpower, enchant and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came, from geneticist in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every chorister has different words, all in a very exotic language: the Zolou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Be Helped to Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people around the world are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them attend a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means “story-teller” or “singer of praise” in Zalou.
No one can speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return to its home region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or earth huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, the diseases that overwhelm Swaziland can be observed on a smaller scale: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbonisi mostly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is no prospect at all.
In the beginning, it was only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The pubic lice and lice belong to parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhagia often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the cause of at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhea and the human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, the rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases more than doubled in 10 years: the figure increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has declined.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared to the previous year.
What Are the Symptoms of a Sexual Illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, pain in the urine, white loss, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as the appearance of buds and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or through close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend to anyone who frequently changes sexual partners to take regular exams.
Most fast-tracked ISTs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by choristers through their voices throughout Germany, the funds are accumulating.
“In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well housed, for example, in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, as the old women are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken houses. With the help of the American organization for health PSI, the association organized an HIV screening test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because although the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” explains Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a subject that touches sexuality.”
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned practices, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, “but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choristers travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many of the people of the black continent’s peak still know about the time.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition as it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears out a few dreadful border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their girls.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
“Go to Esitjeni, you’ll find light there,” the people there say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres by bird, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who tap foot into the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly immersed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that could go up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the assumption of a life presence on the planet, explains the lead scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help us understand how water and other life-critical elements arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, named "W5", a rather unromantic name, in the 6,500 light-year-old constellation of Cassiopeia.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope has photographed the flaring brilliance of a dying star.
The beagle-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birth chamber.
The Pleiades, clusters of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope further highlights the colors.
In this infrared photo, Helica’s nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Verseau.
His similarities with a terrestrial continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only infrared detectors from the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and brightest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the tint, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three sleds of dust divide the shining heart of the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentary: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two fusion galaxies rush towards each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula, in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than common household dust.
This photo was taken from optical and x-ray images taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle composed of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this cluster of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also constantly create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing the computing power of his machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They planted two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and its mirror diameter will reach 30 meters.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has provided us with images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data has been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now sure of it.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach the age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.

A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is of a shaky romance.
Around the many turns of the road, the small bus crawls along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, one would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh lives, of which not much is known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and have a very long lifespan.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not match at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
“Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision contest, and next year there will be the festival of the world’s oldest people,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
You can discover the life of about eight dozens of Talysh from the region that are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120.
Have another child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And when you think the oldest person documented was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he would have still conceived a daughter.
Would Shirali Muslimov have been mistaken for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about man at the great age of Central Asia.
“Astonishingly old people also live in certain parts of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” explains Scholz, “and in Sardinia, too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil status register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is a fact, however, that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of the people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a bartender, whose contents she beats incessantly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also gamble in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armoured glasses in the shape of a belly.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long braids of a dark blonde that her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and so I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I have never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly Retirement Is Enough to Live
She always ate what came from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is amazing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the nation’s father figure, a man who still ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats per month (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, an amount that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-time grinning son is right: "The elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country’s deep rift.
The draft constitution based on sharia is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not shy of words filled with emotions.
We need to succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he told state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all the members of the confused and desperately despondent opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by the majority-Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night shift are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
This was and still is a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal maneuver to apply a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
In any case, it suggests a newly introduced article stating that, in all matters relating to the Sharia, the al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto lead to the administration of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the rule of Mubarak, these courts worked to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The state must also, as the project reads, protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morality and values”.
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offensive people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi is submitting to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Resurrected"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital supremacy of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual accord in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, promising to bring down the sharia before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we are going to win,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, who finished third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foster a “putsch against democracy.”
“If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” Jasser Said, an opponent, exclaims.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet shed,” Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in many, chanted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
“Clean our country!” they asked Morsi, stating that “the Qur’an [was] their constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that’s what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud.
In their view, now is the time to let the people decide by the ballots of the direction that the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutionally imposed process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did this not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
“And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new constitution,” he laments during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are appalling violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda laments.
Yet, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could pay off.
A protester on Tharir Square warned: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway’s rakfish: is it the world’s most fragrant fish?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country be linked to the appetite of the locals for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the scenery is spectacular – and this ubiquitous smell permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprayed with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it’s cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
“You eat raw, and then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also known as “Rakfish General”, who is in charge of managing the festival.
Around us, people sip small pieces of fish and get a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfish,” adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses spoiled by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, albeit fragrant, element of Norway’s past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> each.
Norway does not often talk about it in the international news, which is not to his dislike.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this killing, they speak of the “July 22 incident.”
The Norwegians have a hard time accepting that in their peaceful country, one of their own was able to commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason why we’re successful,” says Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and the eyes of a translucent blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray at hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people living here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out of the window, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its stock market tight.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
“Don’t forget the rakfisk,” she adds with careless laughter.
I stand under the snow and I'm queuing up to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of lentils, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay at is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the smelliest of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It would be the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls off his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, the BBC’s Will Grant is interested in the challenges ahead and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, with results owed to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is preying on a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and tentacle state that encircles the capital. On its land of preference, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once clogged and full of crevices.
Plates bearing its name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to make sustainable changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so much needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very engaged, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, it is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military was called to rescue to fight drug gangs that are raging in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women killed in the last two years have been found on the edge of landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a far higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in front of them.
In a concrete house, typical of this devastated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Se<0xC3><0xB1>ora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric stiffness was already started.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana is wearing the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old comedian, a troublemaker, a crying woman.
They want us to accept what they're saying and shut up.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made a promise that he will make it his priority during his term.
“I hope he will be as good as he was when he was governor,” Olvera said in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counteract allegations of abuse that Bradley Manning allegedly was a victim of during his detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the cause of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. military history -- missed many occasions to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, have not been released.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a petition demanding that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified of his testimony.
The military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein and Manning discussed the forms that officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms, on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that his guards had reserved for him was “excellent” and that the treatment he had received within the prison was overall “very professional.”
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns orally about certain issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues mentioned.
“They wrote ‘no problem’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I didn’t raise problems,” Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special committee that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "injury risk".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know I was doing well, and I wanted to be removed from my status... to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to military prison from the Marines' base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide when he was in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, blanket, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also clarified that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up so that they could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked overnight in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge’s questions Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard’s order that he should release his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release her.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic band of his slip or tongs to injure himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, tongue, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty in a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all the indictment heads are detained, he is sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He said many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarre says Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
There were signs indicating two paths: one for the Mexicanos, the other for the Extranjeros.
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which line to go to.
I grew up in central California, where I’ve been called the “Mexican” my whole life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, as well as the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish," or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And on the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for special qualifications or union traits.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed to the "Foreign" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are pushing to stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half of their territory to the tip of the rifle in writing.
But for Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country maintains with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the topic of bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they treat us as if we were individuals of lower race and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the good side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexican Americans are disgusted with it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
Besides, many Mexican-Americans I know don’t feel like they’re part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered to be Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a wonderful country that we absolutely need to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans still want them in the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, Israeli rockets fired from Gaza and the city of Israel landed near Tevl.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has blown everything up, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Even though the ceasefire granted on November 21 remains, this week’s fighting has strengthened the supporters of the force, on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has dried up.
Having killed some of its leaders and repulsed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals from Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a thriving regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over and caused Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s wealthiest and most dynamic states.
Hamas members cheer and say that the growing Islamist is swaying around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominance, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas’s allies rule.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and centralized of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily turned to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hardline will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in a box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proven to be effective and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the cause of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza’s rocket fire has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier that impedes the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a legitimate Palestinian state, and which protects their poor international status from continuing Jewish settlements.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman at the close of the January 22 election, has the good part.
Why do you put these Palestinian scoundrels to sleep by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, wouldn’t they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will prevail; but it is possible that the Arab Spring will change.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not like Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is good luck -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is meant to one day explode in Israeli-occupied territories – a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a land transfer by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now strive to end the movement of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a Jerusalem by Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
This is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packets have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world premiere, with logos and colors replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photos of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world’s most stringent tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people haven’t started smoking before the age of 26, there’s a 99 percent chance they’ll never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on the law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would relaunch the black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“Detrimental consequences will come from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrific packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population segment targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you’re working in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has given himself the opportunity to make a video, or is this an agency-led marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in place rather than marketing.
The industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had major trade deals with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be made in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries about similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I'm ignoring them.
“You take a cigarette and you pack the pack,” said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a packet with a picture of a mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the “King of the Pack Tobaccoist” in central Sydney, said the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store the packages on the shelves.
“Before it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
"The government just had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to entertain yourself (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child praise the boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us — and our children — to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting pathways, or even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that’s not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes a long way,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there’s the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After scouring numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but not being able to start a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although they would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is “interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.”
Anxiety can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we get bored when it’s actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened to an article on tape tape.
Some groups heard, coming from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, a disruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like looking at objects on an assembly line, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or sneeze, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved,” said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocorded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "difficulty predisposition scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly bullied.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if today’s boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” notably because children and adolescents don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead individuals to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Annoyance is the way the brain has found out to let you know you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s the best thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t learn to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation moves from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant boiling generated by activities and technology is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtimes.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, there is no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were aboard a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Orozco received a citation to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for its consumption - minor offenses, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is it one of them?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado’s vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for its personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been categorized immediately.
The police services have stopped accusing adults aged 21 and over of minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative constituencies have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own it.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are moving so fast that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of Aurora police, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first of all regarding use for therapeutic purposes and now for personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could rely," he said.
Washington’s I-502 law comes into effect on Dec. 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
In the meantime, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees proper access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales stores within 30 km around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sales trade, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute people 21 years of age and older who had implicated people "in order to "small amounts of marijuana," and that this type of police should be prosecuted.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce the new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "district attorney" Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession matters, primarily to pressure users to detoxify themselves.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who committed a crime that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offence,” Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show up to adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the county’s public prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, offering a suitable legal and government framework for personal marijuana consumption is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public prosecutor's office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws."
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, too, have trouble accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case-law for drug legalization.
While advocates and state representatives are enforcing a new legalized sales border, they are anxiously awaiting the federal government’s directives, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will cede.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that police are probably not going to smash the doors to grab small bags of drugs, there’s a strong bet that they’re opposed to licensed marijuana sales for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration policy adviser.
Many cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local authorities have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where someone is granted a permit and then we are faced with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was ostracized and expelled from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It’s not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to the University of Oxford.
My father and older brother studied in what was to me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said facetiously that I had left after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I had been the victim of bullying and was the subject of constant harassment.
Not because of my rather odd name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential counselor of Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
Why talk about it today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students is suffering the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s Student Room (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable” because of their political views.
They want to have a representative on the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC documentary Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among them was student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who is moving to Rolls-Royce, carrying a silver-plated suit and moving with a chrome-headed rod.
In other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as emissary loops for setting up higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a newspaper Sunday "that there is a growing left-wing party in the universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at the Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought like that during my first few weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and of paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, due to the reduction in the funding of graduate studies.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that not only did the professors engage in sarcasm against Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on strike-miners, privatization and government opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I fell victim to was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I've lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a puzzling face, was easily carried away.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tape on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student of English, named James, who appeared as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the case.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with all that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This strategy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, didn’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and renounce my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began to make the shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding shelter with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained to him why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreaming bells.
Even my communist friends had impeccable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's for takin' you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a session of conducted work the following week, when another history professor suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do as much.
Inspired by shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and treating them as "old fools".
The rest was short-lived.
It was my father who smashed the last nail of my oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed carpeted in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back there.
You can treat me like a wet chicken with a crychard.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance over notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: A Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian tailor.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The tailor recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a master of sewing", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high sewing models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the focal point of a story whose only protagonist is "Il Signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, you will find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the creme of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret d'Margaret.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest tailor of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving the royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all love being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of the beauties of the time like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance over notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, also did not forget the charisma of the tailor.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Square of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his mind in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Nobility line parade
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes the people who are well educated and with the biggest titles and they like him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters wide that proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to walk on the podium to admire a "dream public" featuring the main creations of Valentino's "Faraut" and "O"aunt with the "O"aunt, like the tailor who had chosen Jack Ken.
Among this audience of models, there are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It’s a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor’s muses.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimates our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can’t forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a flyer skirt, a draped bust and a falling neckline.
"It was a dream come true," said Arenberg's widow Rodrigue.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the tailor with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of souvenirs that she carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the seamstress calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with beads inlays, twelve different kinds of lace and a four-and-a-half-meter drag.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high fashion of the late twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obscured for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as much honors as any of his clients' spouses.
"Its refinement, its calm, its neat and perfect look have always blinked my eyes," d'Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
“He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.”
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen’s human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano-carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulfur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by carrying the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas emitted from the inlets of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, weighing a total of nearly 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, at a turtle-like pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur extracted.
Once up there, a path crawls between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scales that a mining company has installed a little below 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, one might say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
She then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what it would gain in the fields.
“Miners’ income is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the carrier who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the work was not so difficult, but Anto returned near his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the Sulphur that I've converted to Jalam, and I'm married to a girl from Bali.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Damaged by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wooden measure with other wearers, gets up every day at two o’clock in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to shine at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not touch one of less than 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not for humans,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old bodybuilder who has been working at Kawah Ijen for 30 years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 pounds, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", as he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which the pupils are obviously deformed by the cheekbones, their usual problems are breathing, breathing, breathing.
By balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 kilograms.
Every day, his companions and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik said, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for this lack of children over the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"Singapore's population must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pills, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a drag of powder on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polykine in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency that created the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill "their national duty."
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in terms of birth, so we felt it was a topic we had to address.
We knew the government had tried several things like launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves: What is more creative to solve this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it that lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers allocates up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders’ conservatism and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don’t the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says this is due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and building a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that have a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year had its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in birth rate has known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put on wheels if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
As far as these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed out, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people give it back later,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” another 20-year-old told us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of accessing property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
So while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is in the private domain for children under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself to by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they combined the term “something very personal” on a personal level and “password and username” when they applied it to social media.
“I’m not going to reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, ten, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secretive secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he said.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share one of my photos or someone who would do the stupid thing,” he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are from the family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant parents or with my friends, quickly,” he says.
He said he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Neither will he trust someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t bother me because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one made any progress on him or asked him his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiments that are known today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine has been hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it on a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
“Even if I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key questions:
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, it is them, the children and young people who are born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we’re learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should be disclosed, published or said at an age where they do not have the maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she says.
Then, Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“When it comes to the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social media,” she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and education advisor, says it is essential that parents read the terms and conditions of use of social networks consciously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to the Guardian, it is essential to remind children that it is not necessary to talk to foreigners.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public.
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 present delegates.
Efe tried on several occasions to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released on the other government's website after the closing of the summit, then stated that it would be published.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollante Humala during brief press statements.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, limited audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating among journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American Arab Country (ASPA) summit and, on this occasion, although it was urgently requested by the press, it also did not broadcast the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as it had previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published in March last year.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited access to information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that cuts a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear the pleas of both parties in Lima’s trial against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing today before this international court,” Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of international disputes, treaties and courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, handing a handful to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the International Court of Justice, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, low-cost internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess risks."
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation [of Latin America] must not have a triumphalistic matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to imagine a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connectivity of South American areas, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were located on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” President Santos said.
"We are going to revise all these routes, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to witness the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro-temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take Europe as an example".
President Correa, who took part in the 6th UNAUR summit in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans “were chatting with each other during World War II” and other conflicts, “but that they are now almost a homeland.”
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the UNASUR.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador expressed his support for the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise on anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes Swedish justice, which has demanded that it submit itself on its territory to an interrogation regarding an alleged sexual offence while "Swedish legislation itself allows to do so by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he's in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that your physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a non-conductor that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, has launched a series of proceedings before different European courts," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain were to grant the cab tomorrow, it would be over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully permits, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or question him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said what he would not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil or perverse politicians, but bad journalists in the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that it was not this kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", as it "destructs the law."
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the right resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said it was "beneficial for Latin America to seize international courts if the two countries agree to accept a judgment so firm as to be."
Referring to the possibility of his being presented as a candidate in the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to fight a third consecutive term, he noted that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes this is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primary, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I win, that would be my last presidential term and I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean a recession in President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: HIV-positive.
“It’s as if the sky had fallen on my head,” he says, referring to the moment of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make “less painful,” in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about him and his hard work was as he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after numerous battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmata.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because he was voiceless."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG in this year's press release.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of exposure of the immune system to the drugs at the time of diagnosis.
To put it simply, it means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," the scientist explained.
In order to put this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died as a result of AIDS has risen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients have died on a national basis.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So, why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never lacked medication, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don’t know they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an undeniable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive while already presenting an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, massive screening tests must be offered to everyone who asks for it."
The specialists and members of the State Aids Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and who was a compulsive cop, despite his young age, he was already a Kaff bearer of AIDS.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I burst three times a week,” they say, not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I pay attention to myself and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony to Joud<0xC3><0xAD>, those who are afraid of her today.
Whether they do the test, if they take risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarises the slogan of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of a hundred, it's very good, but as a result, still today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: “What are you going to do about it?”, posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is a question that teenagers don’t want to hear, the journalist says.
It proposes to re-orient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but are found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had responded when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contaminants are sexually transmitted, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A U.S. Court of Appeals ruling ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group granted through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a detrimental precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to judge Harlin Hale's June 15 ruling for the Northern Texas District Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s main glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge reports that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican law recognizes this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are a half-dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies had secured the debts.
In addition, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in every way the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. the funds "waste" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Aurelios ob'u n' Major, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 without stopping the severe economic crisis facing the United States, impacting costs to the country.
For now, the family company Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is, with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require the trial to be reviewed by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, signaling that this would free it from the conventions signed by the two States to bring it to the same level as the Bill 15.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they assemble Vitro and they assemble the country.

They're besieging the Dragon Mars
Meeting at an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean this weekend, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and civil society members approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the opening of the Chinese Dragon Cant Mart.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of Great Wall country products, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East area in order to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to the industry.
The ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a requirement from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property History.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was seen as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The globe-trotter of basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a cerebral hemorrhage convicts him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether it is as a lower league player, national basketball team player, manager and manager of both the national team, the Bays, with the BSN.
"I've worn several hats in basketball all my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he lives with Isabel de more than 50 years old.
“Basketball is my whole life.
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and souvenirs that remind him of his unusual itinerary, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he most cherishes are those that remind him of his passing as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or team manager.
"It was my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
It has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leading here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a tough player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's positions on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came in 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn't let us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and put a racket on the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that had won the bronze in the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the Le<0xC3><0xB3>n brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Houruritiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all forecasts.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, this is Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team consisting of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armando Torres.
In my youth, I love the work that Leo Arill does.
What is your biggest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious season of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN counted up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island during the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while it is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
The Death of Actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a ruthless, formidable and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
“Larry was back in his dear Dallas hometown, playing the ironic role he loved the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her press attaché, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he was living life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis with Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in cinema are well received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. that Larry Hagman experienced his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their loved ones was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", coined to keep the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.’s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R,” Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, the co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is under construction, the channel reported.
At the moment, neither Warner nor TNT have announced how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who became famous with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stage of New York theatres in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and that he married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les memoires impiatoles de J.R.)
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist troubled patients.
"I advise them, I trust them, I come with them when they come to have surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a while, but it’s okay.”
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the “End of the World” has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a class on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hammer: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “great reckoning” on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him over the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a tax slump that some have dubbed “the Armageddon of Debt” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end-of-time thought it was.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he’s not the only teacher to give lessons on “the end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Beautifulr gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
“We’re analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” said Beautifulr.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World."
“We’re adding “2012” to have the opportunity to take the course again, in case the world doesn’t go away,” Professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The classes turned out to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said about his high-level student-led course, which consisted of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and infirmary student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project was about Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old West Chester graduate student at Temple.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an anxiety associated with the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has sparked a surge in these speculations.
“In other places around the globe, people don’t think about it,” he says.
This is the majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who gives classes in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that there were classes here on “the end of the world.”
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or to philosophize about the fact that December 21 will mark the beginning of a 7-year period at the end.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Several told us that they were thinking of going to parties "from the end of the world".
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh at each other,” said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
