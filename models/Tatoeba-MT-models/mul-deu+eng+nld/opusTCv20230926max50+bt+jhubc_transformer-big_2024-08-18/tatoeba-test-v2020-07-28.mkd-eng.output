It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started to stop.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
It's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm a pedestrian.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He is a lover of bread.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use it, Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a break.
How much is it worth?
Our water was up to the deer.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking backwards and forwards.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
It's probably still there.
She looked great.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The exit was blocked.
Breakfast is from 7:00 to 9:00.
Tom's back last week.
They were all scared.
I've watched it before.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views with the public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
It's mine, give it back to me.
Wolves smeared the herd.
This song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're not right, people.
Tom was very productive.
You rascals are idiots.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I like that tattoo a lot.
Get a card for the bag.
I don't want to surrender to the police.
You're mad at me, I can recognize you.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back later?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have they done so far?
Tom's out of his mind.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should've known you'd be here.
When was the robbery?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom was doing what Mary had told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom realizes he wasn't a good dad, so he's trying to take a bath.
Tom can't make himself up.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down at me.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
He was influenced by alcohol.
Dan decides to leave the city.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around him.
They're pretty safe.
There's a bit of confusion in the pictures.
No one cares. No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I'd definitely answer.
I have to help him.
He's criticizing himself.
You'll know when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom smashed the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure that Tom gets home, please?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we're not made up of monkeys, but we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it, if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop making fun of him, Tom.
What could go the other way?
When do I get to Boston?
He later ate breakfast, though.
Are you helping her?
Are you two a relative?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my account.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Shall we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give his best?
Mary wrapped up the film.
She's got a nice manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary had hit John.
I've written a report to Tom.
Do you buy these?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Put the hat down.
The acting is very good.
Please, don't mumble.
I was carrying a spirit.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at it.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke french.
He cleaned up.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose flows whenever I'm real.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is incorrect.
I'm trying to explain this to you in such a way that you understand it.
Everybody's looking for happiness.
Has anyone else entered the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me awfully in high school.
Tom was wearing a cap on which the price still stood.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
It has to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what he wrote in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would have loaned you money if you asked him.
Tom's obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human.
You don't make a man with a stick.
She tried it herself.
Run! Run!
Is it paid for delivery?
I want the beets.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You've never seen one, have you?
You'll never hit.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long, you've got to finish it tonight!
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What's wrong with you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also get checks.
A cent is a dollar.
How did it get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonian has four vocabulary modes: expressive, conditional, ordered, and overridden.
You haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The quiet surface reflected her drawings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need a permit.
We are the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember how I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom is now a martyr.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy look like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How could you not sleep?
They give me advice.
Tom started yelling.
He needs a toothpaste on this tooth.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom took me to his mother's pussy.
I didn't have an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Does Tom think that's what happened?
The show must go on.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't get any attention.
I'm almost unconscious.
Pick up your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
It's not gonna run out of gas.
Tom's a troll.
Who do you have on the list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Get me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Are we here to wait for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom's moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Make sure you don't get caught up in the cramped bar.
Both of them coughed.
The train passed through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the jars.
We weren't expecting them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want tennis?
It'll be all right.
The sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the darkest day they will try to escape from.
They're all crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since she was a kindergartener.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still validated.
I'm here to look for her.
It's wrong.
Why are you working for them?
Your future begins today. I'm sorry.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
The police have already asked him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
That's weird.
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They were smiling quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop him, Tom.
I put a snail on him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom's got to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who is the loser?
That'll finish the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was especially reluctant to speak, because of his difficult speech.
She did not accept the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him that Mary wasn't here.
The bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is incorrect.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were in vain trying to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate has to be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape.
He's licking.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage from his essay.
Tom's happy with Mary.
Tom's incompetent.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by man-eaters.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't look busy.
We'll catch up on that right away.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Let's go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Get the clamp out.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom came forward to listen to me.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
You didn't want the prize, did you?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
They're insincere.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Come on. Come on.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short dresses.
Can you explain to me why?
You can stay in here.
Come on, Albert, your theory is flawed.
Bankruptcy.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little?
I like the school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to confront Tom directly.
My son's not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a chunk of height in his story.
The battle was short.
How retarded I am!
We've been discussing this.
Tom grabbed the ball.
Where's the nearest club?
Let them call me.
Electric heater heats the ceramic tiles from the floor of the bathroom.
Tom helped Mary out.
I know you'll give me back when you have the money.
Dana came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires a skill set.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm running out of wars.
In the forest, the monkeys descended from the tiny ones.
Forget it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he renounced his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
He's got his sleeve tied up.
I thought you weren't gonna like Tom.
Even Tom still doesn't know.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet! Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's dark.
The tubes are clogged.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They coughed next to him.
He's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked him to do.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the report is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I have thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm crazy.
Unfortunately, you're going to have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia was very fond of the concerts.
You invited them to join us.
Where should I park?
Does he care about anyone?
How are you to blame for that?
A beer from a bottle of wine.
I fell off the wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in a book?
Do you mind?
When does it start performing?
She sounds disillusioned.
Tom's socks are falling apart.
Tom asked Mary to donate money.
I have it with me.
Wasn't your name Cooky the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But she's overreacting.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did she ask for money?
Hold it!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It is a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's up to you to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running down the ledge.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senf's really hot.
We're advertising our TV products.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
It happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that.
You were a great mentor.
Tom's listening to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a cypress?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
Hit me in the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Did you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was gonna panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to go a little bit longer.
You should try this one.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked him.
Tom's fighting.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it so obvious?
Tom really needs your help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would've understood.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was a dick?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfying?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says his previous dentist told him he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don’t expect everyone to share your thoughts.
That's what Tom suggested.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carrot powder is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything he said.
This was a tough night for me.
Tom was driving through the city with his wheel brake unnoticed.
Yes, in any case.
Do you want camping?
- Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced pupils.
Tom seems dubious.
Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty excited.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave by now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly and do not consider their own behavior to be undesirable.
Wear high heels to make it taller.
You want to cook?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times a month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a son's car.
Don't yell.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What's that got to do with it?
We're finally seeing each other, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was cheering.
You're a freakin' bitch.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made a decision.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to go mountaineering.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used indelible expressions.
Your coffee is energy-saving!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big deal for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom's at NASA.
Tom writes well.
Something very similar has happened to me!
I'll make sure that Tom writes his homework.
She didn’t feel safe in her own home anymore.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom's really pissed off.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all see her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
- Avoid her.
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why was he yelling?
Well, I've got news.
This is a good place to put our tent.
That was so beautiful.
Let me stay. Let me stay.
Tom refuses to help Mary.
It's possible that Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do it all.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
He gave a word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom's the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There are many birds in the forest.
Please, let me stay.
Let's go on foot.
He just wanted to meet me, Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible that Tom's richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
I'm so sorry.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicidal.
Squirrels, butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring this to you as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom's on his knees.
Where did the pineapples come from?
Can I talk to you upstairs?
It is made of leather.
I have to get some rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom came in, and the crowd cheered.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't make it.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink gassed drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the type.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching. That's all.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a chickpeas with bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going what I want it to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Take 5 pills a day to sleep.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking a cigarette.
I know what that sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm feeling much better already.
I gave them one more chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure has taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want to be seen.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My dad used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a bugger.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I had to shut up.
I'm hot.
Tom came in early.
He was drying his wet clothes at the end of the fire.
He is always fluent in his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a glass of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What's gonna happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital.
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What's the use of that?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl was running slowly.
Looks like you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Your prejudices save you a lot of time. You can form thoughts without needing the facts.
It didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
He was forced to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be a fool.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn’t resist.
Tom's still smashed.
Do people really have to hate each other? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
I didn't hear that.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your lunch.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
What's it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom's always got what he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned up his room.
You know I'd do anything for your red eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom's on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
I think Tom likes the idea.
This is the first squirrel I’ve seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did you let us go?
I've been home lately.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems to be having fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch out!
Linda had a fever and is suspected to be pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting began more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and can.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom's fixed up.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cockroaches.
I'm not safe here.
To my great sorrow, Mary came to the party in a vague dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst type of mammoth is the emotional mammoth.
Let's get serious.
The beekeepers remove the sac to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom’s eyes lit up as Mary walked into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that riddle yet.
Tom was respecting Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom moved his toes to his feet.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's in big trouble.
It's not blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they reach the age of one year, so people eat them.
Could you pull the arrow out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you know to be.
Can I see her?
He spends his money on water.
We're not hiding anything.
Looks like I just didn't think.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
You're really happy?
Ask her to explain it.
Come on, come on.
The book is heavy.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's been lying to me all the time.
The rooms in the hotel obviously very poorly suppress sounds. I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let’s take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you hitting me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels don't keep and don't lead.
Why doesn't Tom help us?
The therapy didn’t help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was at his disposal.
Tom's going to town.
I am interested in Japanese culture.
This is Jave.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did it come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These goats are burning.
Tom went fishing. He's a fisherman.
Tom didn't even think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I didn't play Monopoly in college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're relatives.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pencil, please?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don’t tell your kids about it.
He was standing in front of her.
There's more exits.
Tom's always been very protective of the kids.
I asked him the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen shawls.
I'm safe.
The eyebrows look strange to you.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven’t found the time to write this report.
I can do without it.
There are people who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
Get dressed.
Tom's threatening Mary's.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I really like to walk along the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a bit expensive.
You're losing your strength.
How could this have happened?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Smile.
We need to find him.
He's been using me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty.
Damn, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to listen to him.
You know how to sneeze?
I've got a lot of money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
And a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Give them the compositions.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was flooded with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
We're going to have some Italian fries this afternoon.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I didn't have three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's in charge today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's a dead drunk.
I need sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was incompetent.
It's my night.
They were traveling to the east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramides that fell from the roof were scattered.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean up the bathtub.
Nominate anytime.
Tom's gonna throw us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's over.
You better go.
Tom slammed the exit.
I have two machines.
What did you find?
Dan admitted to Linda that he was a heavy drinker.
It's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom dropped his booze.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
Looks like it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not here to help you.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary yelling.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The Amebs are life-sustaining.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes to swim every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The waves are made by the wind.
Take a clean glass from the closet.
This is not a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Did you see that much?
That would be a disaster.
I like how the French write their word for "bubambamara".
The lifter can move 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's precarious without any help.
Is that what you're up to?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert person.
I love to travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom was apparently trying to convince Mary to take on something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wipes his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one's ever come here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
They bite the conscience, don't they?
There's blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom's beard's been?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take the maramche, your nose is running.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw him, Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
All you have to do is trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely goes out.
We've pitched a tent.
I thought it wasn't going to rain.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Kamoli to stay.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still dressed in pyjamas and a bathing suit when I came in the morning.
We've all read that.
Go up there.
You're backwards.
The sentence is not grammatically correct.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
In the middle of the city there is a fountain.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree obstructed the road.
Don't interrupt, Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my offenses have failed.
Mathematics works best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
Put your head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the grape this morning?
He believes in strange things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary that he had seen John with Alice.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were travelers.
I think Tom's empty.
Some fish know how to change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Bring me some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think you've been extorted.
Tom shakes his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It's got us working too much.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and the deceased at every funeral.
Tom's probably all right.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a nice evening.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Humid climatic conditions are not characteristic of the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary was going to help him.
Tom's never there.
Please, give up on yourself.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out the pencil.
Why should I care what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long does it take to take this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Put a hack on Facebook too!
Did he buy us anything?
The answer was “yes”.
Lovers who are truly happy don’t record their own happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm studying English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We depend on work.
The box is made of tin.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust her in your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's angry.
Try not to pay any attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
There was a lot of semen; there was a lot of semen.
Tom's very bored.
I was vaccinated against the flu.
Just give it a try.
I want to play too.
Tom was a piano professor.
Tom was one-legged.
Is he interested in Tom?
Here it is.
I want to have a little fun with you for Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I'm never a surfer.
I'll find something.
We ate the turtle soup.
We can work outdoors if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's jewels.
That cake is calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disorientated.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
Soon we'll be able to sit down.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's not hidden from her?
It's not usually a pencil.
The water was boiling.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed disheartened.
Tom says Mary's supposed to be happy.
I'm a slow car.
I'm not a pussycat.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest inmates I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Are we here to wait?
If you go out so naked, you'll get a cold.
Is it still painful?
That was pretty funny.
I've set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Are they all busy?
They don’t want people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was hurt.
Where were you last night?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should be going home.
Tom didn't resist.
We had a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All the shops are closed.
You're white again!
Stop shoving your dick.
Tom's done with the gardens.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
Unnecessary drama.
We believe in God.
We need to take everything we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Is Tom getting along with the co-workers?
That smells like chewing gum.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape to the police.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow he still doesn't believe me.
What is short?
Thank you again for coming.
Our mother.
The wounded soldier barely left.
The sun has just risen.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you bite me?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
Tom often downloads movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's unobtrusive humor.
The light is turned off by the water.
Tom licked the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your places.
Can I touch you?
Are you missing something?
Let a man sit down and cry.
Are you going to help him?
We went among the trees.
In any case, I'll do it.
I knew you'd be on Tom's side.
They could not have avoided them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
It's my fault I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to His prophets.
Tom behaved like a knight.
We're on a quiz with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I've got lunch.
I hate it when you fight.
I had to be cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
You're soaking your lungs with a tube.
I'm sorry, but my answer is rejected.
I'll bring it to you.
Tom has written two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any presents.
Tom was a workaholic.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd was smiling.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
Get down the ledge.
Should I come up with something?
I need to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's see.
The Europeans like to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He has a lot of debts.
They know the most important cities.
What's under the roof?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's all the drinks.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously crazy.
Tom came to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her skeleton.
The teacher is teaching.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they scared?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece that they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she's back.
I don't have a pencil.
When should we start taking care of ourselves?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
I'm in pain.
The question is who will do it.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's making me nervous.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me what's going on.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a Wonderkind.
He walks to school.
It's starting to get into our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very imaginative.
Now the question is what to do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished in fourth place out of 56 runners.
Don't yell.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he became obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds very good.
I mean, Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my rooms.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Knit a woolen sweater.
I've been throwing them away for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to hang out with Tom.
You'll never be accepted into that club.
Tom was not born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
Animals are endangered.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has a huge potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so that we didn't miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so worried about tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
Exaggerated.
Please, let me finish it.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom’s whiskers are heavenly, and they get even better when he drinks a few beers.
You have benign eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
If it were, it would fix it... when the vine gives birth to grapes.
Tom's an advisor.
Can I talk to you?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when has there been a fireworks?
It's possible that Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I leave them to hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom loves him just as much as you do.
I didn't betray anything.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to call them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question for which no one, including myself, has found an answer, despite thirty years of research into the female soul, is “What do women want?”
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
The villagers are harvesting crops.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the failure?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did he ask her to leave?
Keep your promises. Keep your promises.
I've been everywhere.
What was the subject?
At every break, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it through your head from me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around. She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was ungrateful.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer also knows how to scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
They all got up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold on to my luck!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I won't move.
Wait a sec.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's plenty of air in here.
She married a man for zero.
The wind is strong.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything nasty.
The old man was dumped before his death.
I don't like the book.
Luckily, I stumbled upon him.
Why would Tom ask for that?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I got the squirrels.
Can someone help me?
We'll go in the afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over it, Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't mind me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was taken to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's right for me.
Are you sure we don't have to make an appointment first?
The one who can hear the butterflies as they laugh knows and how the clouds taste.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's going to surrender.
Just find them.
I can't go out with them.
They pulled a sledgehammer to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not for you to wait like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I would be much more afraid.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my working hours.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is on our right.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want to get my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money she had saved them.
I think it's time to go.
The guy's a gangster.
It's possible that Tom saw it.
Tom's a little bit of a bitch.
Tom's very unsuspecting.
What did they think?
How to find the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's drunk.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants revenge.
Tom grabbed a fork in the sticker.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks it's too cool for me.
Kittens are like mammals.
Dan slowed Matt down and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally get it.
Tom's acting upbeat.
Are they brothers?
“Did you like his music?” “No, and you?”
Thank you to everyone who came.
Tom said he didn't want to eat in that restaurant.
It's about to turn.
This will make our work much easier.
I think it's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still envious?
Why would you leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He has wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his own dinner.
If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew we wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this one.
Turn the sleeves on.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's all I need.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisons Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's in charge here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Maybe Tom's gonna say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It'll get even cooler.
What are you drinking?
How it happened, how it happened.
His legs were swollen.
Tom's got his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me a location on the map?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to hell.
Look ahead. Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Are you angry, Tom?
This is my newest turn.
I haven't been well for two days.
It's a hose waste, it's too easy to fold.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have been amazed.
Tom doesn't know what the difference is between a donkey and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these. Take these.
We're expecting her.
The rain doesn’t come in the air.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got a real one.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
You want to sit down?
Tom had his doubts.
Tom was fucking Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what's happened here makes sense.
I've set them up.
What Are the Symptoms of Poisoning With Mushrooms?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure that John writes his homework.
I can deal with her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
Looks like I expected a little better.
I already do.
He writes a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was acting like he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary's.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely got out.
Did they hire you?
The gas flows.
Tom could see that Mary was texting.
You're gonna be better.
Tom was a little confused.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and stab her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell him I love him.
You have to find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do what's gonna happen to you.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He smoked a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not happening here.
It is better to be optimistic and to lie than to be pessimistic and to be right.
The water was milk.
I'm waiting for the semaphore to change.
The boy was silent.
The body of the ship is divided into several watertight parts.
Well, given what he cooked for you, I'm gonna wash the dishes.
Let's leave the theme.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
There's fake flakes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the sneezing?
I'm not gonna wait for them.
You don't have to be scared.
“Are you angry with me?” “Oh, no!”
He's not as shy as he used to be.
Contas?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told to do?
We can help you find them.
I have to make him help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom's never been a villain.
You're too smart for that.
It's very easy to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played jams, some tile, some with a ball. Others drove a wheel or rode wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendships.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowy.
I worked for them.
There's not a lot of milk in the bottle.
We both have to go.
The pain caused by love is the sweetness of any kind of pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Come on over here.
I was just having breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait for me to check in the manual.
The energy comes from the inside.
No one trusts them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He's smashed his head.
We're done.
Get the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom's freaking out.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
Today it's less humid than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curries.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Is there nothing you can do?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't decide what the baby wants, because it's pointing to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go shopping at home.
It's true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Come on, let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old charisma in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a fake trail.
Tom was fighting.
I said maybe it'll shut down.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix the blinds?
Go on.
I forgot his address.
You're handcuffed?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Its bottom has a slit on one side.
Let's get something late.
I'll be out right now.
What's your analysis?
Tom's busy helping out.
I'm good at it.
She doesn’t know how to read or write.
Tom hurt your leg.
Come on in.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that what Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You have a lot of beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I think Tom's not breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's going to be out of jail sometime.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom's made a list of things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife? No.
Milk is sour.
We're running out of food.
Is it about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him for a job.
Why are you resisting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father-in-law.
Tom didn’t know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Guess how much money we'll need next year.
Burning cigarettes in prison.
How much does it cost there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
You get up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
In which state is Boston located?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I was just snoring in my room, waiting for me to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is very happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I've become a lawyer to help people.
You've just heard.
Tom has a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He did his best.
He's a coward.
First, let's talk about what to do, Tom.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not gonna take that risk.
This house needs to be repaired.
I'm excited, Tom.
Tom's a runner.
Tom's not listening.
They immediately want everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are very different.
I go fishing every week.
What's been decided?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never leave you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The bunker's dry.
I thought I'd call them for help.
Maybe it's best to call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our contract, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German chips a lot.
We were eighteen years old then.
I'm making thirteen bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate caffeine.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's running away.
Go on with that.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They're drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should pick her.
Stand up.
You're magnificent.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Put out the candles and think of a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom looked at Mary harshly.
Tom was wearing a duxer.
Tom looks resolute.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow it.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready already?
How long has it been?
Don't burn.
Who Caused the Fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the gardens.
Tom's a joker.
We've been much worse.
Tom was trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
I only had one drink.
No one writes to me.
Tom's heart's broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm looking for.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
They were all in control.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm only calling you as long as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they looked at me.
I know Tom's address.
What was your last job?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
We are optimistic.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't invite him to a party often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not that hard.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom was staring around, expecting something to happen to him.
They convinced me to give up smoking.
It's warm here, you can put on your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
It often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
In fact, it was a lot more fun than I had expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that'll change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I wouldn't want to get caught.
Their friendship quickly grew into a love of their own.
Tom's acting so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the forms.
I don't imagine a party like that, but how you like it.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga originates from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom smashed his toast with butter.
We've got work to do.
I heard it like a snail.
- Shall we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boy.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the ridge.
I'll accept whatever it is.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It will be Christmas soon.
You need to feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seems to have been used to such problems.
You'll be all right.
It was all so easy.
I'm sorry, but I've been roasting coffee on the mushamas.
He rarely went there.
Tom's shy.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the culprits.
Tom also gave Mary a doll.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if it can be said at all that it is possible.
This was an arena day.
I'm wearing bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcome the weakness.
How many skeletons do you make a day?
I'll just sit here.
Don't you have a random key?
Let's be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom's out of business.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was rooted in alcohol.
Tom's getting drunk.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is a tough one.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little bet.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
Definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you're busy.
What if we can't find them?
Don't let me pick you up, Tom.
He won first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smokes marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday, she was late.
You're disgusting.
Everybody's gonna shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
He gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it's weird.
No one can be saved from death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble so many times.
Let someone open the door.
Is this yours?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
“Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Do we need them that much?
He was desperate because of his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has pain in his ear.
Day hit him in the face with a hammer.
Who gave you such an idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not the right time now.
You don't have any more alcohol.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom is famous.
There was a song in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped out.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's Tom got in mind?
The mother's advice would outweigh the friendliness.
We haven't escaped the danger yet.
Tom's mad.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a helmet.
He is now calling the police.
Tom's looking for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom right away.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that bitch?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the ribbon.
I scratched it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom saw it worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to make pasta.
The hunter walked deep into the woods and never returned.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay what I need.
I haven't been happy since you left, Tom.
The breakfast was served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop yelling, it's getting my head.
You're not going to command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful look!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get tired.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.
This elephant is adored by young children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on karmin.
She has a picture.
Something's floating.
The flowers are blooming.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang on Tatooeba, under urgent!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared and give up.
Is there a free space?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me for it yet.
I want tea.
In any case, I wouldn't want to get in.
Doesn't anyone want to sit with you?
It would really be nice to be quiet.
Tom decided that Mary was making a bad impression.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do that.
It wasn't easy.
I was a traveler.
I'll fly from school.
I often heard him play the melody on the trumpet.
Dissatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom was crazy.
I think Tom's gonna be here on time.
Stick to the plan.
If you're hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complexed.
Check to see if the gas is turned off.
Would you take part in this event?
There's hardly any coffee left in the garbage.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a couple of books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I like coffee more than tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy human society.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you pass the message to Tom?
He flirts so aggressively that the women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, just by chance.
You gonna talk to Tom?
It’s hard to understand self-harm if you’ve never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
Pressure's on the rise.
Tom immediately responded to Mary’s question.
It's a miracle you survived.
He's been driving that car for three years.
Is it safe to use in meals?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save him, Tom.
You don't have a problem solved, do you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's very angry.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you're going to have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't like it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom's upbeat.
Take Tom's gun away.
Look back.
Tom hasn't returned in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you play any kind of sport?
Tom, get to know your new babysitter.
He's afraid he won't get lung cancer.
I've had a lot of studies.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I got a quality.
Has anyone been able to take care of the child?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom whispered in his voice.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Are you going to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I don't have anything to say.
That would be good.
We're on foot now.
Tom's very rude.
That's all I said.
Tom's got a butterfly.
Dan's got Linda out safely.
They're my cousins.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man's wrong.
I can't wait to find out what a gift Tom made for me.
I saw him in person.
I love all my children the same.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems to be nervous.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no replacement.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where they are not present.
My sister does her hair on a freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
The water from the rain evaporates when it is warm.
Ask him to wait till I get here.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
Looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
I'm sure Tom's still in school.
I never say anything, even if it makes me nervous.
You're below his level.
It's my turn to ask questions.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom's very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you coming back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You've got to hurry up to catch the last train.
Please, ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to take the job.
How Much of Our Body Is Water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very smart.
Please, help me wait for him, Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't stay longer than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Do we have to believe that?
What did you touch so much?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't have to convince him.
Tom is sitting behind Mary's French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was dragged into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a prick.
What's your plan?
Why are you angry with me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
Forgive me for falling in like this.
The books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom cleared the gardens.
It was discarded.
I'm not sleeping anymore.
Tom's pretty clear.
They must be worried.
I transported it.
That gave me an idea.
The federation of the clock is broken.
I was wondering about him.
Tom says you like Mary, too.
Come on, everybody, get me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
The kids need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do that somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe that anything can happen.
You need to eat less red meat.
You have to take care of the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom's got a pistol.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made the boxes?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's go sledding.
You dare to sleep here.
Talking to him always reassures me.
I hear they're paying pretty well.
Tom was a funny character.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil are collected in a storm?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
The bulb is green.
Tom regretted what he told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom grinned.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom, you've lost your hair.
Everybody's sitting down.
He touches her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like walking.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate the school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just getting started.
His brother was patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So I'm serious.
Forbidden to speak during the test, people.
You had to.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Can I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You need to write a thank-you letter to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Oh, come on!
What if Tom refuses?
I've changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom says he wants to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp over.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirms Mary's claim.
That's very close.
We took care of you.
Experience is not inherited – everyone gets their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
The fabric stretches a lot when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom began to talk.
I've been away for an hour.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without a cheat, it's gonna be hard for me to catch fish.
Tom was sleeping.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces the level of inhibition.
Tom needs two of his help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
The pupils were black and deep as the abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn the radio on, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a very good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because the weather was cold.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll get back to you.
It's not coming this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far from the Himalayas.
Tom's coming out.
Please, repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom licked.
Tom didn't even know Mary wasn't there.
She had gone to school.
It is said that Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends. It's yours.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why not buy more than one of these?
We worked hard.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook something for you.
You've got too much work to do.
Is it possible that it's Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
Police found prints of shoes at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would love that.
She ran out of halfway.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come, too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you going to give him?
Is that what I'm talking about?
Tom's the gardener.
I'll have to try to deal with this on my own.
They probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't made of diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream that you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered together.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is volatile.
Hands off Tom's.
Are you crazy, people?
It's hot.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I am irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
In the face of it, I cut the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two children.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despises Mary.
Tom's on the hook.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my lucky one.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left untidy food on the plate.
Tom changed direction.
There is no living person in the school.
The rocket flew.
We were laughing.
Tom was a little enchanted.
Tom's only come for a visit.
Where to start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was overjoyed.
Tom tried to make it look busy, so Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I seldom eat meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help.
I'll call her later.
The flowers will bloom quickly after you have cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I was eating too late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I know how to fly.
We've spent the money.
There was a hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here, let's go.
Does that sound stupid?
I don't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I’ve never struggled to be anything other than who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to tell if Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't heat me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Have you thought of a wish?
Children are afraid of the dark at times.
Stay away from me.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom sat down.
Cuban hair.
This is the best restaurant in the area.
There he is. I liked him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
I heard them licking.
Too bad I didn't drive a wheel here.
I have to visit Tom.
What's wrong with you?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
It's classified.
It's not that much.
That's what I said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'm damned!
I'd walk alone first.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in a position.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to touch you.
I didn't see where he put his car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give them a chance.
He suddenly showed up.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all of Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's a sex car dealer.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
You know that?
He's done the job badly.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's overcrowded.
Who was the thief?
He has a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom's not gonna catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice in the photos doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was going to be tough.
I didn’t know whether to laugh or get angry.
I'm mad at you.
We're waiting.
Tom woke up at 7:00.
I've always loved a dog.
You're completely safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come to visit us next month?
The puppets control the wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you.
The other girls stabbed her because of her clothes.
You're gonna get confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom's already done what he should have done.
I'll give them one more chance.
He just called me.
The failure put him off.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand watching him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants are harmful to bees’ health.
Now you can go.
They're stretching.
Tom's second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
The tourists were not satisfied.
Tom's got his socks in his room.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom whistles.
Laws are like a spider - they hunt flies, but they let the axes and snails pierce.
You're proud of the pawn.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk, as was his habit.
He pulled his fur coat down, climbed up, and gently slid down the door.
Tom looks so happy, you know.
We don't look at the same thing, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
There was something about Tom.
You love life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're full.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long have you been here, Tom?
She's texting her boyfriend.
Did anyone see Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat that?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate, though.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom is memorable.
Kyoto is a very nice city.
The hammer doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my will.
“Why did you break my vase?” “Good for you.”
We were very close.
I'm drowning every day.
Give me your knife.
No one is defending my country.
Tom never gave up on it.
I asked her not to interfere.
Tomorrow is not a big day.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is predatory.
Wait for me to surprise you.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet? It doesn't matter! I just found it under the couch.
Now he's watching TV.
What's going on here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop, please?
I guess that's okay.
You can tie me up, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never spoil my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It's happening all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try the sweater.
The cat threw its claws into my hand.
"When did you sleep last night?" "At four o'clock." "What? What were you doing so late?" "I was on the phone with the ex."
How'd you get them?
No offense! No offense!
I was a little burdened with something else.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're disturbing me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom's not as naive as many people think.
I punched him in the fork.
We have two daughters and a son.
I'm going to lunch.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there a word at all?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone turned down Tom.
You can't let him go.
Ken's picking up old wigs.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you were saying.
We have to face the facts.
There's no damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom sleeps on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose between?
We've got to pick them up in bed.
The only spice that Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got closer to Tom.
I don't want to dismantle them.
Tom was overweight.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while driving, causing a traffic jam.
I brought a few bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very nervous.
Why would Tom do that?
I have a job for you.
How is a plurality of names formed?
You saved my life.
It was too little.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I've been taken by a nasty cold from him.
It's getting better.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
I saw Tom.
He's not mad at us.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom needs a bottle.
Bring me some coffee.
It's all right with you.
That was a trick.
The theory will be handed over to the mathematicians.
Where'd this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in jail for espionage.
Can we help him in any way?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters can only be read with a magnifying glass.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear the sadness in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are your guns?
Did she kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I'd do anything to make money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say something you don't think about.
I've decorated my room.
This is pure insanity!
I think I'm gonna go see Tom and see what he's like.
Stay with Tom to throw his coat away.
We were getting close to the small island.
You're not gonna win.
Wait a minute, my laundry is done, I'm going to get it.
Tom was a miner.
It's white across.
As if I had enough willpower to stick to a diet.
The man in question is currently in America.
He's thought to be guilty.
I'm gonna rip him off, Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here for the first time.
I don't sound like that pipe.
I'm tired of my eyes.
I need to run away from her.
Tom makes $300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Are you expecting them?
The service is quick.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
A boy grabbed my bag while he was passing by with a wheel.
When was the last time your baby got sick?
My muscles hurt a little.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm rude.
They're gonna give me a break, 'cause I'm too late for work.
I thought it would be nice to buy you a pair of earrings.
What's he gonna do now?
That's it!
There's always a fin.
Your health is very important to me, why don't you go see a doctor?
Spirit, are you there?
There are no smokers here.
Are you still working on the freezer?
The city has restored this old, historic building.
I can't ask that from him.
She's really embarrassed.
Tom came back covered in mud.
It's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's at the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I'm just throwing it in the trash.
We just got out of there.
Tom's reserved a seat.
I want to use this.
What color were Tom's socks?
Tom baked my cake.
I've never been a juror before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't like being touched.
Look at the clouds.
He was so angry that his veins were acquired.
Travelling abroad doesn’t come in handy.
He ended up as a winner.
Tom came right away.
I'm here to apologize.
There won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.
I went home and told my wife about my job in Boston.
Tom got dressed and went to bed.
And the opposite is true.

Tom didn't want to go so early.
I'll explain later.

Tom's on the wheel.
He came back at six o'clock.
It has been proven that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
Be careful when you go up the stairs.
Was he with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What's this made of?
The butler opened the door.
Tom was totally wrong.
Get your hands off me.
Don't say that name around me.
You're gonna throw that away?
Tom has a good job.
They're my things.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to a friend of mine.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom changed the subject.
We'll handle this.
It's a very nice feeling.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll read this.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom had a catastrophic failure.
He's just back from vacation.

Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.

From his eyes, I realized that he was angry.
I miss Boston.
My girlfriend brought me a red and white rose.
We need to ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
She shot three times.
I'll be sorry if I like it.
They're grates.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in a choir.
I don't have a word to say anymore.
You can make your job easier.

We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom's not going to the market.
Give me a few minutes.
You know how to recognize children's voices without problems.

Tom doesn't like me.
Don't you know him by chance, Tom?
He wasn’t sure if he liked the plan.
Tom's a very young man.
Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see him.
Tom was only partly joking.
I'll find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid capturing him.
Have you found her yet?
Tom's alone there.
You've done your job well.
Don't be a dick.
Freedom of speech is limited in some countries.

We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Would you recommend me a good book?
I'll take you home.
Does your stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You're not kidding me.
Try to get rid of it.
I think I love you.
I take care of all of you.
They stabbed next to her.
You're a pig.
You're unreliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It will be hard to convince them.
Don't get mad now.
Did anyone see Tom?
I'd love to get some help with this.
I owe a lot to Tom.
It was an unbelievable evening.
The smells of jasmine and lavender are my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom seemed to be bored.
She’s very individualistic in mind.
The knife had a very old tip.
Get ready.
Put him down here.
I swear, I wouldn't get caught with you if I burned you down and you were the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you'd lost your watch.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them sleep.
Did they all agree?
These are my pencils.
Are you going to get dressed?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week it's extremely warm.
No one wanted to get out of the table.
Do you think Tom's gonna like this?
Tom's nearing an intersection.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.

My boy's a journalist.
What is Tom afraid of?
Tom would've resisted.
What brand of shampoo do you use?
It's for playing cards.

What were they doing?
I think you should go out on your own with this.
As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with Tom from a medical point of view.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
Tom seems to be trusting.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a scarf?

I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
The worse, the better.

Please, don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you got here?
I can't get a real answer from Tom.
Camoli, I should've known this earlier.
Did something go wrong?
I didn't do that for him.

Someone's just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not a big sailor.
My dad got a white drip infection last month.
What a sad story!
Try to get a good night's sleep.

I don't have any friends.
Tom plays in a band and is very handy.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom's interest faded.
Let's play ball.
Yesterday was fun.
Tom might be able to help us if we ask him nicely.
I like to eat at restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.

I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom seems to be effective.
I have to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take care of him.
It has nothing to do with happiness.
I think you know the rules.
Honestly, I'm sorry about that.
How are we today?
Here's your wife.
He's back at six.
Let go of the people.
Tom's eye didn't flicker.
You're a good son.

That was the wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
They saw Dan talking to a stranger near the restaurant.
Tom did it with ease.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a cherry in front of my house.
He's the boss of the company.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm so busy getting ready for the party.
It's not gonna get better.
He's already done his job.
Shut up my ears.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to push myself.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston at two and a half.
How'd Tom know?
She teaches at a school for the deaf.
You have a habit that I don't like.
You sound very sure.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why he stayed so long.
I don't want to wait.
What is it, to be invisible to him?
The radio is off.
I turned it down, Tom.
You should be proud of yourself.
I am in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in the bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know it, Tom.
Let's do our best.
I'll pay.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this one.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
That's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Envy is a sin.
All the kids are strangers.
They shot me.
Tom's not prone to drama.
I completed 25 projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't help but look through the key.
Tea smells good.
Well, I was.
Do you believe them?
That column isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did anyone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They were silently speaking.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to speak French.
We've got to get back.
That's what I'm thinking.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this, please?
He's as tall as her.
They've been kicked.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much it costs?
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Oh, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were kicked.
Let's get down the street.
There was no soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew that Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I have a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you a lot, by the way.
You're cooking nicely.
There is no shorter path to the top, only to the failure.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's paying a lot.
It was sad.
Looks like you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automated vehicles are now being deployed.
I can't make a decision like that.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give yourself up.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I missed him again, Tom.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my snack?
The man was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making kaygan.
I love the blue color.
The girl liberated the bird.
I didn't tell you to accept customs.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave her a stuffed rabbit to his daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I've been calling for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play gadgets?
You picked her nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you my one, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was an indebtedness to me that I spent the evening with a smart, spirited, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little horny.
The girl ran away from home and got out of control of her parents.
Tom's a scoundrel.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
They won't be invited.
He said you'd write me a message last night, but he put me out, obviously.
Guess.
He changed his clothes to bathe.
A river of sweat began to fall on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just fight it.
We are taught mathematics.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you fly?
Movies are a great distraction.
At first I didn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests can we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
Looks like I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
The flight was cancelled due to unfavorable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom was sitting patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices more popular.
It's possible they're coming back.
I'm so scared of you!
The whole board is against it.
The world illuminates the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoiding bad associations.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut off my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The tap is not coming out.
Tom committed suicide.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom likes milk.
I gave him a false address.
I remember.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's gonna come.
I'm disgusted.
I think so.
I think you're Spanish.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think about Tom.
They're starting to shoot.
Tom's sneezing.
I think Tom knows who stole my purse.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna be?
The squirrels sing.
Tom recommends it to Mary.
Who were they?
Tom began to talk.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm really going to try to be kind to Tom.
Tom ate it all.
Where to buy Tom?
He looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid? !
Tom's gone without me.
It's all quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Come on, get up.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom's got a problem with anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like an entirely new person.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm real.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom's running up.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
I need to tighten my belt.
Tom's about to run into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said to him.
This is not a place for a three-year-old.
I know how to ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom's gone to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping standing.
I'm getting weaker.
The cake looks good.
Did someone break your heart? No.
That's how I feel.
What's wrong with you?
We'd like to see Tom.
Where'd you go, Tom?
Who won the award?
Please, come in on time.
The Germans have a positive attitude towards the Holocaust.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
He visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they placed his body in a large tomb.
Women love men with scarves.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept baccarat?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly, I heard a loud thunder.
Both of them snarled.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this one?
I didn't get lucky.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I was very angry with Tom.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now come on in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly and friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always wanted more and more mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the trap?
Tom is one of the most prominent American songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom begs he'll never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a mountain far away.
I've missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do that if I could.
Tom's really fucked up.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We were the first to arrive.
I've already given her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom was very fond of Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started to talk.
I'll be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom doesn't have much to offer.
I got kicked.
No one's going to bore you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought scented bags for garbage.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport's expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're very strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
You have a good memory.
Is he allowed to do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We have bad news for them.
We have to go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did he go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You probably already know the answer.
Would you mind not taking it?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robs the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great use to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come and save you.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We screwed up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was slenderly brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I'm never looking for a hand.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We started there.
I didn't mean to say thank you.
There was no need to speak.
My fork hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the mail with him.
What's the point?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a few pancakes.
I'm studying French.
Don't look at me.
It was too late.
I live on the lower floor.
The girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was unthinkable.
Mary has broken up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's attention.
We've got to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You're not gonna need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him alone.
I never wear a suit.
The grease is broken.
He's gone.
Its clientele consists mainly of poor people.
None of us was right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why's that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women love men with scarves.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People are dying all the time.
He's perfectly suited for it.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
Take out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't like to go.
Tom seems a little quiet in the morning.
No one understands me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom stabbed him in the ass.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this topic with you.
Did he ask for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is atrocious.
Do you want to vote?
The more dangerous it is, the more honorable it is.
We should've bought another bottle of wine.
Add the potatoes.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me the book back, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's good at writing.
Tom looked up.
My ears are ringing.
I'm taking this opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a jerk!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to bow.
Tom's been suspended.
They were moving.
She's gonna be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks disheartened.
Something's weird.
You're not old enough, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that's bothering us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's all right.
You're capable, but you're oblivious.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this on your own.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's mad.
It's from work.
We'll get along.
Familiarity encourages students to work in a bad way.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the door from the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about thirty years old.
What's the deal?
I see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make a deal for you.
He's on his way.
A day he was attacked by two men.
Tom was measured by weight.
I'm sure something's happened to Tom.
It has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go and talk to Tom.
Tom shook his nose.
Tom seems a little shocked.
He's screwed up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "dame" was used only for nobles.
Tom has been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak on your own behalf.
Do you believe that?
How to choose only one person?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My uncle was there, swollen on a bloody bed, with a bulge swollen deep in my heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They're paying me to clean Tom's garage.
You can get some rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud of yourself.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking aloud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed him, Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I can hear your child's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are doing something.
Just leave us on the run.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins the fights.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunderings?
Don't confuse work and pleasure.
I now work in Boston.
Put the crown on the king's head.
Tom was holding his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's been revoked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping you.
Tom was sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't make Tom angry.
I turned on the ventilator and directed it to the wall.
This is a homemade jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not exactly true.
Warriors are small.
Please, stay close by.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as I saw him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank has borrowed a million dollars from the company.
I have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me when I talk.
This is Tom's ringing.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday. I don't care.
Tom was having a party.
Tom said he didn't care what the guy's name was.
I'm gonna get close to your baby.
That was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I am interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Can you lend me an interesting book, please?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
A sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I said my own thing.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut off his nose.
When will we see each other?
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's a man.
The woman calls the man.
Tom has found something really interesting.
They had a lot more than us.
It'll be all right.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Day of Anger.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
He was very kind of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You're gonna feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It’s about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It was doing a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just got in there.
There's blood in my eye.
That's where Mary came in yesterday.
She's exaggerating!
There's a son missing.
I'm trying to work.
What taste do you like?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling that the show will be cancelled; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom believes he should not use deodorant.
Does he swim often, Tom?
The girl fell asleep.
Go write a homework assignment.
Don’t force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
For your laughter.
Tom paid me.
It is my duty to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's acting awkward.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
It was very warm for Tom.
We must always support our children at all times.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I have the impression that it rains all day.
You can't call them.
- Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase smaller than me, they complained that she had too much to wear.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where do you live at all? Somewhere in Eastern Europe.
Mary's the right expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in oranges.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a son-in-law named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was going to polish the slow.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please do not add any comments.
That was Tom's only fault.
Do you remember what I wore when I met you?
Lightnings are usually accompanied by thunderstorms.
Tom likes tea with cinnamon.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom shoved him to the ground.
Teaching is not over!
The cups are in the cupboard.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to fly with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You need to wear a helmet while you're driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance to it.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you still can't sleep?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They're making love.
I burned the waste.
We've both seen him.
That would be uncultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a renowned conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
In the tropics there are only two seasons.
I think I made a pretty good statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend again.
Just get this job done.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a small question.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't like it.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she held her head reminds me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
Now we're looking for them.
My shoes are flooded.
Tom would return it.
She's always doing valuable work.
Which country are you a citizen of?
Illegal trade in ivory is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet with Tom.
I love dogs more than cats.
There's still a little space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
Can't stand the heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't afford that.
I need you now.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't want it like that.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Go on with your work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm lonely, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
Now I'm looking for them.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom could hear Mary calling John.
My hands are smashed.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sat for long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
They were all talking.
How proud I am of you.
Tom was looking for the chips in the kitchen.
A lot of people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What did you wear?
I'll beat you up.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you give her a call?
Familiar.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have every disease.
She was reassured.
We play with fate.
I thought she had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to sympathize.
There's a little more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The rush made me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like it, Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
They all laughed at the beach.
Tom turned into a pop star.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I'm having trouble with sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I've been really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's got some water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's good at handling a saw.
Turn it off.
I don’t share my real name on any website.
They broke the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you. I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but it looks like I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful. I'm sorry.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been coming back for a week, up and down.
He is slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a gardentop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really pissed.
Let Tom talk to you.
I know you still love him, Tom.
Get back from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The flies are on the ceiling.
Her face was smashed with sperm.
Tom's fair.
You have to do this first.
We got together around noon.
I'm not doing anything tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you've won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was shy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd know anything about you.
Tom strives to become a teacher.
I wish you a good week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom's got to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
You're overpriced.
We're being childish.
Tom was a bass player.
Tom would have enjoyed this.
Tom's climbing up.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
The squirrel blew the tire.
We made wood.
This is so much better.
I'm gonna make her blow your lawn.
It's all about mathematics.
Tom pulled his money out of the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder it is, the better.
You can get some rest.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom has always been a hard-headed man.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're Brooke.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate strawberries and steaks.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school in spite of the illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They knocked on the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not a protein.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom doesn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
It's still not okay.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me back.
Was he honest?
The file was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let go.
They're close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire came alive in the coffin of the dead.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast. Come on.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where do these documents have to be delivered?
Tom has a bruise in his eye.
Tom's firm's in jeopardy.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates to run.
I couldn't call you.
Is that true?
I know you're angry.
When I walked in the morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom will be blurred.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was going to be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me smile.
Unfortunately, I don’t have enough money right now.
“Are you a vegetarian?” “No, and you?”
The lightning strikes the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking to me.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never even get there again.
I'm filming.
I forgot your number.
Tom has a job to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in a horoscope?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom is good at his job.
I've figured it out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom arranged all of this.
I won't betray her.
The flowers attract the bees.
The water is milk.
There was no plant life in this area at all.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom’s response?
You will do as I command you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's a long way off.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is damned.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, so?
I am very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not a scientist at that.
She's got tights.
I don't ovulate.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There is no time for explanation.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
What the fuck are you looking for here, why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
You're waiting for a well-known Mr. Kimura on the line.
Men and women are men of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound released the pus.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn’t resist.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
I'm sure Tom's feeling lonely.
What are you looking for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly in motion.
I couldn't find her.
Tom dumped Mary's papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't exactly agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like the two are in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It is a moral choice for the translator to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language they produce.
You're nasty.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd call him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Check it out.
Give me the french key.
Tom seems to be worried.
It was a meeting.
Tom and Mary know what's happened.
We just hired him, Tom.
He won the lottery.
I was inspired by Tom's politeness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked into Mary’s eyes and smiled.
It was very congested in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
- Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could have done better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
To find them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom came home.
You'll be famous in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really do like you.
It was nice of you to let me stay here in touch.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're dropping.
We're going to market.
Tom knew Mary was going to like John.
Tom's a scoundrel.
I just cut off my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
I have a headache.
I wouldn't recommend it.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Someone might have followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure right.
We went along the coast.
I don't want you to harass them.
It depends on your decision.
That's conceivable.
Tom reacted badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
Tom was looking at you.
It's not attractive.
Very few people understand that.
You're very cut out.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her granddaughter.
This is our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom shivered.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed the fire extinguisher and started to inject.
It's for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak on your own behalf.
It resulted in a lot of difficulties.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're good at that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold back.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
Forget your ranch!
And so the conscience really makes us all cowards.
You don't need to panic.
I gave him one of them.
I don’t expect anything less than perfection.
I think this hotel is going to be a little expensive.
Tom pulled the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't get his pants on.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
We're glad to see you.
You can leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom came to Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become a favorite subject for me.
The work was done quickly.
What's the evidence?
When we woke up in the morning, we were faced with terrible news.
The knee wound is now nauseating.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't do anything.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
How long has Tom been asleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered a lot of losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, otherwise?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a candy with menthol?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They're gonna do that.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I'm almost cut out.
Here's where I'll get off.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
The blood now cracked in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy guy to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She wants me to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The children drew pictures of the sidewalk with chalk.
You're wondering why you've stayed so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom got married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom always tries to act the way he thinks it's right.
Tom doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What is it about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to fail with the majestic chandeliers she has in her house.
I'm not a resident.
What do you have in the dishes?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What is your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
It's a good swim.
You won't find us.
I've heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched TV when I got here.
You don't.
Do you think you can stop me?
Actually, it's very often.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Didn't I do something to make me angry, Tom?
Triangles do not have four needles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom's dealing with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the carmine.
Let's see.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let this be between us.
I've been everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my purse.
Everyone's waiting.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a dubious answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's broken up.
Mr. Gorbachev, take down the wall!
Tom looks sluggish.
Tom's got a hit.
It's as it should be.
Let's try to get together.
It's gonna be hard.
I'm not happy with my retirement.
Thank you for asking.
I have a good reason not to like him, Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'm going to investigate that right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are locked.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl who wears a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom has much to fight.
What's wrong with you?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers?
We had a meeting.
Tom's gonna be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Is that my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so much loved.
I can't control it.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not very fond of Tom.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom got married to Mary last year.
Tom goes to school by car.
Did you watch?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think of us?
Do you write the proverbs?
It was a great series.
We have to go find them.
The last time I was home was Friday night when I was thirteen.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You're always forgetting.
Put the hat down.
I don't know what you think will change.
I do that for him.
He can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just Macy's got me.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's a bit mad.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom is well-armed.
We took care of it.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we should stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to satisfy my thirst.
Tom came in on time.
Today, television is boring.
Oh, that's great.
Tom found a baby with four leaves.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom's really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please, look at me.
She gave up on smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We started to say hi to them.
You didn't smoke?
All visitors have to be examined.
Where'd you get that slut?
You're nothing and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
Well, that sounds totally valid.
It's the law!
The water breaks through the stone.
You need to ask Tom.
Please, write it down.
Tom's safe here.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should've done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of the sparks flying from the fireplace.
It's just fabricated.
Tom's been hanging out with Mary all night.
He wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I'm always dreaming of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get the soul together.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam as soon as possible.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
You stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a squirrel.
I bought these medications for my dad.
The kids love cakes.
He was quite restrained.
I can go out with Tom at the end.
Tom's nervous.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary raised all the money for Tom.
Enough of the bullshit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom's always loved a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started to hook up.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom was out of work earlier.
We've got it all.
I baked his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You were right from the beginning.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say "goodbye"?
How many instruments do you know how to play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
I'm sure these are fakes.
Beauty can not be determined objectively, but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's impeccable.
His girlfriend weakened him.
Between me and Tom, it's perfect.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
Tom woke up screaming from a nightmare.
Tom's got a weak look.
The twin didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it done?
We all want lasting peace.
We met a few days ago.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom opened his eyes.
The tribe was not happy to be a peacemaker.
Open it.
Put on your forearm.
You may be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom's got a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
I’ve already written everything that needs to be written.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe it was Tom who stole Mary's wheel.
Is he aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll tell you what you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you to come back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I’ve never changed my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting at the club.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll take you.
I set it up, Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom knows he's very retaliatory.
I've seen it go.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're so cute.
I thought I'd remember.
Is Tatooeba really too slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's home again.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're dolls.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack up.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I had breakfast today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was intriguing.
I can't see anything.
He's a pretty nasty man!
They smashed their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You'd better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom's acting jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one on the spot.
Stop! Stop!
You want some cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
The cows are not clear at all.
It was very unfortunate on the part of Tom.
It's empty.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got confused.
Let them sniff you.
Cutting is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom squirmed inside.
At the same time you are heavy and light, and pleasant and strong; I cannot live without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I'm not listening.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm here.
That disappoints him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
As if I understood.
Tom's a backpacker.
I'm guessing most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You didn't fail.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We need to find them first.
I'm keeping an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a bowl.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I'm always mixing those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
The report is very fuss-written.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't cry.
I wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom's turning the quack.
I hope this is good.
If they were lying about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and it was cold.
There is nothing worse than stupidity and indifference.
It's all time.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What are the websites made of?
Vampires live forever.
Both of them were smiling.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate parrots.
I didn't say I did that.
He wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he will not be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to run?
I need Tom.
Changes are never easy.
Is Boston far away?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got a rejection.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please, don't vote for her.
I'll have a good time with this later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cap out of the bottle.
And Tom's gonna be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the hook.
The deeps symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
The traitor!
I'll do my best for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I'm probably losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm falling asleep.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a link between character and blood type.
She sounded very angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't working hard enough.
He's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Also, avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a freezer.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
Games on the computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking for them everywhere.
I really like your web-page.
I'll get you.
Press the button on it.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom's smashed his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
They all carry eggs with them.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's tough.
Don't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I'm making a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out of here.
His words sound logical.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a hole.
A lot of trees have fallen.
Lions do not distinguish colors.
That wasn't right.
The answer is neat.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memoirs.
Look up there.
I want you to give me my money back right now.
Tom believed that Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
- Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we've both been lying.
I was happy here.
Only a handful of passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you getting married to Tom.
Tom's acting polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed her so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
There's a pus in my right ear.
Cardboard boxes are brittle.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
They don't get names.
It's Ferr.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed her.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you before.
We packed their suitcases.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They didn't swear.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn him around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Wishes live a long time.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom sleeps very tightly.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk to me later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I get it.
Did he come here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Can you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is, who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start all over again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for welcoming me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, are you still in love with me?
I prefer eggs from underwear.
Can you explain that to me?
Where's his house?
Love is for the madman.
Why would you help him?
Tom lighted his shoes.
We have lost our faith in humanity.
Tom's dealing with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom, lend me some money.
Am I interrupting you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look at how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants have died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna be a lot of bandits.
I'm Peder.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I honor you for dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should have a look.
Get down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm fighting.
He drove fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax. Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom'll at least apologize.
He's coming down to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses a month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate him, Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wipes his face.
What's the use of you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
I fell down when she was wearing that clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor below this one.
They believed him.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Maybe Tom's alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm going out to eat.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
This narrows the choice.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to take care of his child.
I drew the word "Alice" to highlight it.
The third good luck.
We've got to go.
This is an airy dough is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let us strive for the virtues and give up the vices.
You're smart.
I am against projects.
Aren't you tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm late.
I could tell that Tom was really tired.
I'll never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports of writing.
It hurts here.
You're disturbing him, Tom.
Where have we gone?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just watch it.
I was just messing with you.
Tom's never showed up again.
My advice would be to go to sleep now and finish it tomorrow.
You've jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most inopportune time.
The dog stared at me like he wanted to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man's hungry.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
It's all fleeting, but good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What was Tom thinking?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies from time to time.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I've been thinking all day.
I suggest we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda one more check.
That's right, people!
The building is a monstrous building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats have bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it a lot!
Is this exactly in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She's got ears like an eagle.
Give her a table.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn’t know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary was going to say.
I don’t like how that sounds at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me give it a try.
I am not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for him, Tom.
I guess you've read my report to me.
Tom's retired.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherry blossoms are swollen.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
You're in an accident, Tom.
Stop it.
Tom looked like he was upset.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally stronger.
She's a life-threatening girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.
Please, stop. Stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded agitated.
They started to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Remember you didn't fall.
"I got nine on the chemistry test. And you?" "The same."
He was lucky to have survived the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was handsome.
How was the game?
I'm a student.
It's right there.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always keep your wheels dirty.
They arrived here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
Looks like I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
The titles should attract the attention of the readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than submit to it.
I'm actually working here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like how you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That's it.
I watched a French film with an English translation.
Tom laughed at Mary.
Tom is full of self-confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother tells me that the child's diseases are fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
Everybody's back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us.
Maybe Tom could sing to us at the wedding.
Who would choose Tom?
The hospital's not very big there.
Most people have to work to keep up with it.
Nothing's ever changed.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I'm not barking their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I don't like freedom, and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty between the ages of ten and eleven, and boys between the ages of eleven and twelve.
She's gone.

The sky will soon be brightened.
I've been cold to the touch.
He thought someone had put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was touched.
Epten was cheap.
Marriage scares a lot of people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big helicopter.
Why can't you come?
The people revolted against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He loves strange animals, such as snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't get carried away when you get home.
Tom taught me how to sing.
“What book are you reading?” – “Roman.”
You're burning the car.
That gun isn't a toy, boy!
Half of the species is female.
They're staring at him.
That's for them.
It's on Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do a socially useful job in order to redeem myself for everything I have done.
Tom's tied up his squirrels.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's beautiful.
This sentence can be interpreted in several different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a scoundrel.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Have they been poisoned?
The kidnappers tied their eyes.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys? Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary has a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I'll give you my word.
Who will pay the rent?
You're a little uneducated.
Hey, put it back in place.
I wanted Tom to come.
Do you think Mary likes Tom?
I've been waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows Bonton.
You've seen what I can do.
We got a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I have it?
It's not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this topic.
Tom was suffocating.
Do you know the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
Don't be stupid.
I still respect him, Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's weak in appearance.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to miss you.
I was preparing a speech.
The snails have an old look.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was horny.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom smiled politely.
The teapot's pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom signaled a kyllase.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather's mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he had to take care of some things.
How's that gonna help?
Dan probably killed Linda by suffocating her.
The small island from a distance looks like a turtle.
Are the squirrels tickling?
What did I ask Tom?
Stop blaming yourself.
I'm thirty.
His acting is in no way perfect at all.
Definitely they are.
Don't wait.
You don't know how long.
The dog lied to him.
Let's go to the movie.
Adorable women age much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He fell asleep.
Mary felt the warmth of her face.
I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom was going to retire.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom's needlessly raising his pocket.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not gonna take the smoke.
Do you think I don't care what you think of me?
She's working from nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what you're saying?
I'm in terrible pain here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom interrupted it.
Tom couldn’t remember where he had left the boy.
Get out of the way.
I'll take my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That thing's done.
It's unnatural.
What did he steal?
Tom's never gonna finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You weren't right about the picture.
I'll get her.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's a replacement.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you'd like my help.
You all seem so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
It's all time.
Faith means hoping for something that the mind can’t hope for.
Tom was with me.
Tom wondered why Mary didn’t want to help him.
You're ruining your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
The two books are equivalent in value to each other.
We rented a movie.
The darkness is coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick your weapons.
He has chosen a new government.
"I'll wash the gardens." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who pulls himself back.
We value our customers. We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked to raise their salary.
I've stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know that Tom would be here?
The quake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't had any more food, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
The grease stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Throw the gun to the ground.
And I'll see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It looks like it's smeared.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan is not working.
It's not my fault.
I couldn't do anything.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
All right?
My day was filled with activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father has the flu.
I'm not waiting too long.
Just take a look.
This is magnificent.
It's missing empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You need to go to the dentist.
The soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
They're listening.
Tom came out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's upset.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They've unraveled it.
Tom's a big dick.
Can I put this in here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe in this at all.
I was wondering about them.
I'm asleep.
I'm planning to go to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
They slumped like an ass.
You have to pay your rent in advance.
Put all the rubbish in the storm.
I'd love to drive with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
“Will you think?” “Yes.”
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting on the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to give him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off the mask.
That's definitely an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm blaming myself.
I like the way you dance.
I need you a little.
They've overstated us.
Tom is the right one.
Tom looks scared, though.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you're dismissing him.
She's white.
Just sit down.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
I was wondering if you could help me out tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show begin?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
The Condores are sniffing me.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to go home on foot after the rain.
I feel good when I'm alone.
Tom's got a lot of money, but he doesn't have any friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in a bad condition.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was left without a surprise.
Can you get those guys?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelves are full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
Applauded.
Fuck me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in the city.
Let's go wake him up, Tom.
How do I find him?
The ice melted.
He spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
I'm sure it's very easy for you.
I've never been caught.
I love my homeland.
I have not learned how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't celebrate me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom stole from me.
Victory is bitter.
They look in the mirror.
I don't feel like crying.
Tom was not tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
Looks very tasty.
I need to understand.
You two got into a fight against me!
I've never had a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom's all a test.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I study music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't count.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you talking about, guys?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed that Mary had caught a fish.
It’s embarrassing to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're detaching.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It probably won’t be worth waiting for.
I have to buy a new queue for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
You want to go to work?
I couldn't bear it.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My biggest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom's running downstairs.
Tom gave a word.
Tom and Mary have been away from us since day one.
Let's fly.
The girls are running and playing.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did this.
“Are you going to eat the spinach?” “I’ll eat it later.”
This is my favorite item.
Tom signaled a kyllase.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you, Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom was singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather strap on her waist.
They extinguished the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom sneezes at Mary.
I'll go look for them.
He came even though it was raining.
I don't want to use a dildo - I prefer real whores.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a psychiatrist.
Tom gave a speech.
Game of the week.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom kicked me out.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's gonna go alone.
Tom only had Fridays at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom was talking too much.
My brother's out.
It was great.
I'd like to be able to tell people my real name.
The dentist inserted a temporary seal.
Tom was actually smiling.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They were contacted by local politicians.
Tom's taking notes.
They gave me a map.
We're going to have a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat an apple or something?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad's giving me a $10 pound a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long have you been working for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom can speak French.
Tom's been pissing me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with an elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us and help us move the keyboard.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting colder.
I couldn’t sleep all night.
- Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you want work?
They're losing their minds.
He really hit me.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often molested at school.
When does it start?
The bear is self-taught.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three coffee spoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark-eyed eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted to do.
That's what I doubted.
Tom doesn't do what he needs to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You need to buy some sugar.
What are you preparing for dinner?
What did you do afterwards?
Take care of Tom.
There is fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, the voice was less dry than before.
He doesn’t want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked in the other direction.
Tom is the only thing that can make Mary smile.
Can't you cut the price a little?
I'm gonna lie down first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a chukunbaba just a few days before she turned ninety-nine.
Anywhere he's been calling?
It’s important to remember that no one is ever 100%.
He gestures as he speaks.
Sit next to me.
Tom's excited.
Tom never gives anyone any money for a loan.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. However, due to his age and poor health, they allowed him to serve that sentence in domestic prison.
Scientists say that people who laugh more often live longer than those who hit a truck.
I talk to her often.
Please, don't ask me about them.
Tom smashed the tree.
The land is still watered, and the sword will most likely give up.
I was getting sleepy.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a chicken?
The dog followed me.
These were Tom’s last words.
I think Tom's gone.
She strives to become an actress.
My plastic bottle's broken.
Is this our cabin?
Let's work this out.
We're refined.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's brilliant.
Tom's very neat.
It is expected that the cloud will sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom's a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom was standing and silent.
I'm collecting stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a cab.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom's doing the fuss work.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Peaches are good.
It doesn't matter.
I want comics.
You have a really good manuscript.
The wind continued to blow.
Meanwhile, the stupid uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I talk to you?
Snails fall from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You are free to wait here.
I got a French frieze.
I want the class to keep quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
How do you get from here to the post office?
I don't want to get Tom involved in this.
It's nothing scary.
Tom laughed at everything.
I went early to catch the first train.
You're still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Will you be wearing a mask this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that warm either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door's cracking.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom handed her over to Mary.
I'm hungry for him.
She's going home.
I'm not sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're pushing me hard enough.
Ask him to explain it.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you take a break?
You haven't asked why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's fine.
The sky is bright.
Galamata will wake up the baby.
Just look right.
That’s not something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary play rhymes.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leans on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
I made the book.
Don't grab my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do that.
Tom reads Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked until two o'clock.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
After a long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go and help her.
Tom served himself with a cup of tea and a toast.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I can make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do that, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
The two of them smiled again.
The wedding has to be perfect for me.
Tom was feeling very strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Are you studying outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He is addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom is the tallest man in his class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would care about him.
Did you write in the diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it alone?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of jail.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to crawl through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'll try my best to get there on time.
No one's come here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause a disease.
We're up and down.
Tom has an old hearing.
I bought them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the cap off.
I helped him unravel the table.
I was eating steaks with potatoes.
It's better for your health to go on a scale.
Tom bought the coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is disgusting.
I'm sorry I even said something to them.
I wouldn't have asked you to find someone else.
Gather me in two and a half.
Tom's pissed.
I was sleeping in the shed.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need a cover.
Tom's seldom late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know of any Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife confirms her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can search in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need guidance.
It was ironic.
You're the one who baked cookies.
It can be carried out.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded the schedule you sent me to Tom.
It's not expensive.
It's a real damage.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
He's stabbed me in the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems to be oblivious.
Your party continues with your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
So I need to know you?
He has covered up all of his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I guess it's nothing.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
In the picture you can see bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just cleaned up Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell it to a dog if it was taller.
I'm going to help my comrades.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets a lot.
You need to hurry up.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a clown.
We despise her.
He came in front of them.
Here, brother, halfway.
Tom sent the new man he had just bought to the table.
Tom's gonna help Mary.
She grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's a smoky guy.
The scenery is excellent.
It's locked.
You found the panties under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
The freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating his victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to resist.
Autumn is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic jam?
On the water and it only takes three minutes to scream.
They could fire me for this.
What's the find?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was very majestic.
Dan was in contact with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to enroll in a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of general human belonging.
What happened was an unfortunate accident.
This building has a gigantic tower.
They kissed each other.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to make himself.
Which is the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is salted.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom continued to exercise.
Try to understand it.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean “yes” or “no”?
Tom slid into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend, can't you see how poor I am?
It seems familiar to me.
I'm jealous of her.
I offered him to smoke his cock, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
There are limits.
With all that heat, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosiloc, jalfia, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
We're disgusted.
You're an insightful man.
It all looked fine.
Just leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered.
Exercising.
She may have outgrown you, but I'm not!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I got it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a cupboard.
It's just to solve this task.
They have to remove the bullet that stuck to his back.
Epten is fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If possible, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunshine.
I don't have a sword.
Doubtful confession.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
Looks like you don't know how it hurts to hit you.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
He's not here because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom is very busy with his research.
Scissors do not help against ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like he's not coming around to ask Tom.
My brother's gonna be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are Potatoes Caloric?
They'll get it soon.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the bat.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't catch you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him makeup.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I've been lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can you give me your name and phone number?
Tom stabbed me with a stone.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing in front of the store in order to avoid the rain.
I have a few reasons to remember.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't understand.
Tom was insistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check it out, Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They all doubled.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out that there is a movie called "Russians are coming! Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still not able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days until Christmas?
He wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The main characters are transmitters of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's sketching.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm taking care of Tom.
I like toasted turtles.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving, causing a traffic jam.
We've got gushnaa.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a smile.
That's all right.
Tom seems to be worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is the camera used?
There was a snowfall.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French quite well.
Be careful not to exaggerate.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with something?
It's so beautiful.
I don't speak English, I don't speak German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off the mountain.
I'm just starving.
They disqualified me.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would you do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not act.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You care too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't borrow you a book.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
I want to be cute.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I here too early?
Sounds really loud.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom's tied up his buckles.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to stay awake until 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should give up?
That doesn't make sense.
Women in the United States did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called a firefighter.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what had happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom decided to go somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm clock's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there a conviction?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's an undisputed fact.
Is it delicious?
Be careful!
We need to give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is a bucket.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom was a little sluggish.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black.
Tom surrenders to his own destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellin.
Did you stop hitting your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why don't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring him.
Survivors are like mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I will examine his stomachs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where does the wolf go?
Wipe your wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Oh, my God, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your own luck !
I may not have graduated.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of that.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy the sentence.
Dan decorates the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom nodded with his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the parachute.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
It was all over.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
That was all my idea.
I don't like puzzles.
This book will help you to write well.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never get her.
Stop talking about her. Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, slurp the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary in the morning.
I cook my toasts with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to get strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunglasses.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's excited.
I almost didn't want to come.
I made a cake.
Look at the number.
I was inspired by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom's suffocating.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month I had an infection of the urinary tract.
Look at the girls.
I'm gonna take off the kilash.
That’s what happened to the previous one.
I have my own theory.
I love the foreign languages.
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefit do we have from that?
I'm with the one I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
“How are you?” “Okay, thank you.”
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick fight.
The neck's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Maybe Tom and Mary will agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were purely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom's not a sport.
Shouldn't we help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he had to take a bath.
It's a pity for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this one.
Tom made the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not getting married.
Where's the mailbox?
The internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He smashed the dog with a stone.
Tom kept staring at me.
It's 7:00 already.
I'm curious.
We can try it.
So I wrote my own book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be imaginary.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
In order to prepare the soil for planting, you need to prune it.
Tom's not doing well today.
We're not watching.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
All right, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed out on the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know it had happened.
I'm at the library.
I've got my pants off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I agree.
Tom admits he spilled the red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is courage.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited Loara's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I knew I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
It's all your business here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Just take me by the hand.
I shouldn't have believed her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedantic in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
You're not alone.
I remember being in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs should I make per day?
Are you going to cry?
Tom's turning around to go.
Tom's kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decides to travel the world.
This is bullshit.
I hate to do this.
The day turned into a dime.
You've got a lot of penetrating eyes.
Isn't that implied?
He seemed tired to me.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to the city.
We need to let Tom get back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I write pretty well.
Will you go back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let's go inside.
Don't let them go.
You need a friend.
Tom seems to be rich.
Tom's acting reliably.
Do you want to drink water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four needles.
I kept working.
He developed an addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those out?
Give them a second.
They sat down and kept silent.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary got in on her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
You want me to take something from the supermarket?
Finish the thought.
Tom erased the knife knife from the knives.
Tom was trying to stay focused, though.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Do you bleed the nieces?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his glass of beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
Let's take a seductive look.
Come on, don't be ashamed.
I don’t want to eat cloned meat.
How far have you gone?
My dad's very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What Do Tigers Eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you get down?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that is possible.
She looked at me sharply under the glasses.
Linda told Dan that he smoked her.
Why would that be too much for them?
Let's not interrupt Tom.
The yarn is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Here's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave nicely.
I've got to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken up the aquarium?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression for several periods of his life.
Can I get your bags?
I'd trust my life with that.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is amazing.
There were penguin feet on the sand.
Tom, you just left.
Dan called the hatcher.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move. Move.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to speak with four eyes.
Tom's not excited.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a barn near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was starving.
She studied English.
With such a lush dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate it.
They're starting to beat her.
He opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't talk to me.
We're going to survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We're going to visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom smashed the chewing tyre.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommends that?
How'd you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to get bad habits!
She's starting to behave strangely.
Most likely, they won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why don't you listen to Tom?

He is interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we waited a long time for the rain.

I'm resting.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.

I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French more suborbo than he was actually speaking.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.

It's working.
Tom got very sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you. He's always liked you.
We'll never find out now.
Shall we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom's just been kicked out.
I'd rather goat cheese than cow cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Did you meet Tom?
Is everyone having fun?
I spent the whole night.
I have an unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know it's yours.

Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn off the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would you believe her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no trace of Tom's voice.

Look at the drawing.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
I think we should talk about this right now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom was acting so happily.
I don't speak English, I speak Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's going to fool you.
Tom didn't really think about that stuff.
There's a wind.
I'm just kidding about you.
I don't know where that is.
We've all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to go.
So you didn't say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole team.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're irritating me.
Not in front of the choir.
The firm went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very talkative.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll make it.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'm going to get sick.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't make Tom angry.
It's a tough task.
You need to make him listen.
I'm surprised it's so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, darling.

When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, listen.
Tom says he can afford it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these advices in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we win, Tom.
Put your hands down.
Where'd you put it?
Tom doesn't know how to accept defeat.
Tom's my man.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Cooky would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.

You don't have to be there for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom could be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
I've had a headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't blame yourself.
Isn't that unusual?
I slammed myself from the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that too much?
They know what happened.

Your hair smells like spring.

Milton hasn't slept well for a week.
When is the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he planned to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
Now this is your house.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I'm feeling better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing what I want.
It's not my decision.
In spite of our expectations, there have been no accusations.

When is it my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby is asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a typo.
It doesn't happen very often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Will the police be here?
We need to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely managed to get caught.
I'm not allowed to interfere.
You beat 'em.
They're quieter.
Tom will be back soon.
I'd be for it.
History is written by the winners.

It's about the heat.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're screwing her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I was three in a row.
I'm here to talk about her.

We'll deal with that.
Bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this well.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this in?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan might have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody likes him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's hot here in hell.
I've seen that.
This is your business!
Please come back to me.
Study here.
Well, congratulations on the wedding.
Kids, you stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
That's great!
The palace has a tall tower.
The kids have homework.
We're going to collect them.

The doctor gave her a sedative.
Do you look like someone who is afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready for the day.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was endangered.
Camellie, I didn't do that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole is tight.
You should go and help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you at the tremor.
It’s nice to have such gifts.
I embarrassed him.
Fuck you or they'll kick you out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long is the journey?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for tomorrow's meeting.
That's the message.

I can move you.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm insisting.
I'm sure Tom's gonna do it this way.
I don't think I've ever been very scared before.
Can you do the job?
We need to get back to him.
You're uncultured.
Do you play sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring him in.

I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
An honest word.
We have three guards who work in alternating ways.
We can't stay together, it wasn't even written down.
Visitors are very welcome.
Could you put it in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox with you.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassment.
We've both been busy.
I'm three hours away.
I want crossword puzzles.
I expected them to be here.
Tom was painting this.
Tom closed his mouth.
You hate him, don't you?
Stop behaving like a child.
Tom's not dead.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.

It's on my head.
I said with my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom's never getting sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm leaving and it's over.
I'm going to change.
Put your headphones down.
It may sound like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom that I want him to give me my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom continued to work.
Please, find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
The first proposal was rejected.
Sooner or later, my film will break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, never, never, never, ever could have happened here.
Tom warmed up in front of the fire.

Write it to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?

Tom's always pissed me off.
Tom's just looking.
Here's your schedule for today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is what are you going to do.
Tom told Mary that he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom looked a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He came back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late, I'll be late for you.
You really should've let me call a cab.
Ispekov asked for an apple.
The sound of the horse's tail calmed him down.

These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom's connected to Mary.
Are you cooking just for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna need to get Tom's permission.
His joke didn't make everyone laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates to run.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I was dancing with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You'd do the same for me.
Now, let's continue the conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I was smiling.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy with the days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop cheating.
Try to figure this out.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I take a shower?
She's helping him.
You always try to see the best in people.
Tom's earning three times as much as me.
I rinsed one.

These are just as good as them.

We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.
Tom hung his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's a little shy.
Is the difference visible?
Come visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did he ask for Tom's money?
Tom didn’t actually do that.
Is this your bag?
It will most likely help her sleep.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll reward the gardens.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
He’s been doing a lot of hard work lately, but he doesn’t see the slightest result.

The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She wanted to become a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is more powerful than hate. . . .
You've got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming.
I'm as tall as him.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
He spent the night drinking in a sledgehammer.
I'm in.
Do you need a lease?
Soul's gone.
I didn't say I believed him.
That's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to owe you one.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a no-brainer joke.
I wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen the grapevine.
I don't think they followed.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling.
I didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom also helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a drink.
What should I tell the kids now?
Leave him alone, Tom.
I've been through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom that tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew that Mary was upset.
Tom started to care.
How did you go on vacation?
We were just a few people in a group of gorillas.
She began to shove her fingers into her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
What if I don't invite Tom to my party?

I'd be happy if the three of you came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are blowing bubbles.
I practice violin for at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
Camoli Tom would have had more time for me.
I'm longing for him.

Come on, Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is quiet.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
Still, I'd like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need a lot of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable to him.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more stuff I've got, the more I'm gonna have to clean up.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don’t forget to apply sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom’s voice could hardly be heard.

Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reorder.
His depression came to an end when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's to blame for anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
It's just a prespy.
Tom's good to me.
No one's gonna find us.
The room was chaos.
“Music is only love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm so hungry for you.
The real story is a little different than what I told you.
It was your fault.
The balloon slowed down.
Who likes insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps, then jump.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never behaved like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom began to laugh.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do it; in any case, you have to.
We did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad you're looking at me?
Merisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to get our minds out of trouble.
I called him last night.
Let me just focus on that.
She sells sea schools.
Watch out for the prisoner.
We all like you.
The boy was crying and crying for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom's not like his brother at all.
Tom was innate.
That's brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you excited?
Tom couldn't have done it on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll be needed.
I have pain in my chest.
I can't pull the knot off.
Give me my money back.
You have to show up first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
He stole my new wristwatch.
It doesn't look very different.
It's been studied.
Tom made Mary's space at the club.
We're screwing him.
It's all right.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I'm happy or not.
Did you save her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your excuse is right up and down.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary came out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The robber stole the gems last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do this alone.
You'd better let me do that.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did.
Let me see him.
What's in it?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and night shine.
No one's gonna get fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The person who pays the bills has the right to rule.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some champagne.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can take mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All the comments are superfluous.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?
Tom rinsed his mouth.
It smells like cheese.
Tom's not wrong.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
Goodness without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems to be hurt.
We know him.
I slept there for hours.
Tom was holding a drink in his hand.
What a couple!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your grievances bothered me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
You think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy here.
What can be taken?
Guess you found him.
Don't take that literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going to the point.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
The snow is one step deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby patted the bell.
Now I'm gonna go look for Tom.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do the job for now.
They need to talk.
It didn't happen that way.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom was listening right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There is no life without hardship.
You totally misunderstood me.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me an asshole.
I'm very attracted to you.
What's for dinner?
Open on page 9th.

He doesn't like fish meat.
We had a fight.
Is Tom eating grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't spit, or I'll rinse your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the desk.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not very happy with Tom's explanation.
Looks like you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked him to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
We need to put a lock.
Tom's parking, he'll be right back.
Love me a little, love me a long time.

Don't you panic?
We need to do this again someday.
I think Tom's sensitive.
He's an honest man.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are equal. That is, however, good news, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.

That's really great.

We didn't draw any conclusions.
Tom came in at about 2:30.
Doesn't sound like they know what.
Tom tried to get away.
I've got a cat float.
The crowd was cheering.
I leave kids growing on the edges.
I think Tom's a villain.
The door was locked.
I'll get your daughter.
I'll call a couple of people.
What are you looking at now?
We've got it.
I was too tired to go on.
It all has its own sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
He writes on his forehead.
Yesterday I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson.
Can this page be used in a similar way to Twitter?

The forest was very peaceful.
I have to get back to them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's insistent.
Most of the clothing worn by Europeans is produced outside of Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can search on the Internet.
When I was younger, I always used to drive.
I couldn’t figure out exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom's gonna argue.
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait for them here?
When I urinate, there's something like pus coming out.
You beat her.
The stars have come up.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I often play ball.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
It will teach them in order.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like this.
Tom's starting.
We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I don’t understand why everyone thinks the book is so good.

Can I have one?

Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have some time?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't let you down.
You stay here and keep her.
Wouldn't you start shaving your hair out of it?
How are you gonna run away?
Let’s start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you gonna do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like the English?
That’s what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these from my grandma's.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
She's in excellent condition.
I grabbed Tom for the elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom's listening.
I think I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The time will wake the baby.
I'm late for spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me. Stop talking about me.
Tom sat on the bench with Mary and watched TV.
Nothing's stopping us.
I think I should've called for help.

Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
You're coming out?

What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.

Just do what you want.
Can I use that for you?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You're going to have to learn badly next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Damn!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd have died sooner than I'd have met your request.

Where was he born?
Tom took two places.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll bring the guns.
Choose the one you like the most.

I just want money.
I'm not saying anything bad about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.

I was the only one who knew where Tom was going.
How badly was he hurt, Tom?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.

Most people are right-wingers.

I really like you guys.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't know if I bought this.

Tom was here early in the morning, apparently.
Get up once, you scoundrel!
How long ago was it?

I want to fuck her.
I can come in tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I am in love with you.

I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom is in the hospital and recovers from an overdose.

Is there a problem?

What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.

Take care, Tom.
It's just words.

Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was in a half-son.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good stuff and the books.
This is a lot worse.
I'm afraid Tom's going to sneak in.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
Something hit me.
Don't you ever suspect anything?

You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.

Let's go to lunch.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, a basketball court, a football field and a billiards table.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been arguing about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was bored with his sister.
We should've given up early.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
And I'm surprised myself.
Dinner.
My work so far has been lost.
“Why do you do that?” “We can.”
What a pig you are.
Shut the gate.
Tom let go of the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You dare to come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds quite acceptable to me.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going to bow.
What did you and Tom do yesterday?
I won't forget.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two species in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who are you living with?
So, what should I tell him?
Where's your child?
Tom's in bed and he's talking on the phone.
They're wonderful.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need a lift to carry them.
The noise bothered the whole town.
The one who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This is not a fucking thing.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you hand Tom's note over?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you writing messages to Mary? No.
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was hitting.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing assault clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three anti-cold pills.
It's possible that Tom's wrong.
They might need some help.
I don't have a vodka.
Tom behaves like a smeared derrick.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We need to ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time it was.
They're very good.
Do you want movies?
Time is forever.
Firstly, you have no right to draw conclusions, and secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
Growing goods.
She's borrowing the line.
We'll see you.
I had to get something.
I believed them.
My mother had to lend me her keys. She had to give me her keys.
Tom's got bugs.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom take part too?
The thief turned himself into a police officer.
We're gonna let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're angry and rejected.
I wish I could help you even more.
Tom is no longer seen.
I think we're ready.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone in the park.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely refurbished the facade of the building, and when I passed it by by car, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that only this has it?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting on the floor.
Tom's forgotten.
Invite him to join us.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston very well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a nearby restaurant.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
She gave him a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the topic.
I'll be back in a little while.
She looked as if she was deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boy.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very hard test.
I'll get a divorce.
It's dinner.
My ball's running.
You're gonna get bruised.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser poured out a nozzle of boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not asking Whitey to give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom continued to pack up.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here at my own will.
It's to protect you.
Someone has always helped me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't care about math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older people.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz and ruby.
Go find them.
You need to ask your mother's permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
Why did you come to Boston? What did you do?
You're our guests.
Tom's offended Mary.
I know I packed it.
You like chickens a lot.
It was a wonderful day.
I made him paint me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I was fast-paced.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that no one else could remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I’ve learned, French was the easiest.
Tom wrote homework.
I counted up to 200.
Take care of this.
Shall I go?
The boy looks like an ape.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay out of Tom's way.
What else did he want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you spend money on a loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea in a specific way.
- Can I cancel? - No.
They were all so busy.
I put you both out.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I've got a housewife.
He took a deep breath.
That's ugly.
I'm not good enough for her.
This woman is easily embarrassed.
Did you get there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do what's right for me.
Tom's got a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I've done something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
That's a great drink.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom had a crush on Mary.
Were you home alone?
He forced a lot of money out of her.
Can you help me figure this out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to come back to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it alone?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make a spider.
You really talk a lot.
It might be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
You don’t always have to believe what others say.
He is in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a bit of a pain.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're moving!
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I’m going to do when I retire.
Tom recognizes Mary's manuscript.
I think it's helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom knows how to do it.
Soon the sound died out.
Who froze you?
I don't quite understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll come as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palms.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Tell me you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom gonna get in?
There's someone at the door.
Tom didn't get away.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a wonderful day.
It's been a wonderful evening.
I think it's possible for me to sneeze.
It's free.
Peter might need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your runner.
What's our situation?
Do you want me to hear it?
You're a real hater.
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who is Responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
No one's talking.
What did you get out of contact with them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cool at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don’t want to be treated differently than before.
You should be fine.
I was following the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's soulless.
I haven’t seen that movie yet.
You've already done that.
You're poor.
Give me one more shot.
Many Russians were killed while photographing themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who laughs, but not who cries.
How old are you, Tom?
She wore a red ribbon around her neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He was distracted by listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can hardly work now.
When did Tom say his party was about to begin?
This was obviously a tough decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would've been happy with Mary.
Dan did his job very well.
I still have pain in my legs.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I've been misunderstood.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know a mason sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like that.
I am open to everything.
I've saved you before.
Stay where you are.
Are you a cheater on her?
“She loves music, doesn’t she?” “Yes, she does.”
The beer was simmering.
That's very interesting.
We're still trying to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
Her sister gave her a flu shot.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
Well, that sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started throwing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a rock while he cleaned his torches.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Shut up, fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is located in Syria.
All the songs were good but yours.
I don't think Tom's going to school tomorrow.
Please, up there.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
They all laughed.
Did Tom look so happy?
Who wrote the texts?
Tom's making scallops.
Tom took a deep breath.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to a cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like you need someone.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought it was causing me.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pencil.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought something for Mary.
There's nothing more like a madman than a drunk.
Take it, Tom.
Tom began to dress up.
I know Tom's been through.
Looks good.
We stopped in Boston.
That's almost working.
I can't concentrate on all this shit.
Share the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
I'd like to honor you tonight.
Can't he wait for that?
They'll pay for their supremacy.
Don't miss any episodes of that soap.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the documents.
We have to ask you a few questions, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate it as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard it.
We're investigating the whole area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me he'd like me to come over to his guests tomorrow afternoon.
Everyone's gonna thank me.
This is where we'll be.
Why do they do that?
I went to college for four years and got nothing but a poor diploma.
This is invaluable.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I'm not planning on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there was only ash.
Tom likes all kinds of vegetables, except cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We're taking Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up.
People can't do miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to get him out of their company.
Those who mix the verb endings "-tsya" and "-tsya" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened after that?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're everywhere.
I didn't count on that.
I was black.
I just saw him last week, Tom.
It shouldn't even take this long.
I'm trying not to break up.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everyone knows how to drive.
Tom brewed two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, just sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences for the whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It's really nasty.
Do you want to chew?
They say that blue parrots contain a lot of nicotine.
Looks like I'm a little tired.
She gave him all of her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is devout and devout.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I'll be able to pass the test.
I think we'll join in, too.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's keeping his car well.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people on earth were born from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm not.
I'm having fun.
We've all got to go find Tom.
I'm fine.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have an order to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the market.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I was just taking a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really think that the entire population of Georgia, who speak a Caucasian language that has no common phonemes or letters in common with English, can fully master English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There are too many things I don’t know.
He was having respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the crazy one.
Tom was smiling.
Are you missing Boston?
I think you should call him.
Every student has their own wardrobe.
Tom's not my type.
This is for them.
Do you really have to work weekends?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here is my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I have something for him.
How do I know if Tom is right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't he fix the pump?
Isn't that beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where'd you go?
Your path is hard.
You'll have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started to play.
Tom wants to be rich.
It's perfect.
You don't know how to do that, do you?
It's a mess.
The blood flows through the blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary is.
Look at my fingernails.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not a musician, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing rebounds.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I really want to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan has learned a lesson in the most difficult way.
I showed them the falsification of my friends.
I'm giving my employees the right to leave early.
Are you alone here?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm so sorry.
What books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm tired.
You were eating cauliflower salad.
I'm going to run.
Tom's got something to chew on.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom had never been to Boston before.
It's nice to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
No one can help me now.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and see.
Do you think you like it?
Innocence is often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's accelerating his pulse.
There's a restaurant around here, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept whispering about how kind, compassionate, brave, and I don’t know what yet.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts in Mary.
You're busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom is watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be me.
They stopped going.
It's not a mistake.
I saw the sweater in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I was embarrassed by the heteronormative propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't take it much longer.
Be kind to yourself as a reward.
This whole thing makes sense.
I'll open your door.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you are.
I don't know how to behave here.
We have to advertise on TV.
Tom shuddered incessantly.
They won't help you.
I'm feeling great.
They're not there.
I don't feel right.
They have a good appetite in the morning.
The warrior made a hole in the wall.
Tom hates us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You have to be happy for them.
This candle is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it a real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
He's acting very sleepy.
Yesterday, I made a cookie with mushrooms.
I hope it succeeds.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom's not gonna be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in the science.
Although the rainworm has both a male and a female reproductive system, it needs another individual to fertilize.
The failure embarrassed Lisa.
I heard he got sick, Tom.
Tom was misunderstood.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm on my way right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is estimated that the temperature of the surface of the sun is about 6,000 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd went crazy.
Tom started to work.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover it.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the hole?
The bread is freshly extracted from the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna make Tom test him.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't believe her.
It's possible Tom's gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did you want to eat Tom?
I have Tom's keys.
Tom refused to do so.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
I told you my dad died when I was thirteen.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
You know a lot about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was a bad epitaph.
This must be yours.
We arrived in time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
A cavalier would never do such a thing.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was implacable.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't make me look like Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check you out later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant then.
Tom has never lost his hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Luckily, the cavity is stable, otherwise the storm would have knocked it down last night.
I heard she was caught.
Tom's got it written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
Who do you work for these days?
I'll give up.
Mary’s eyes brightened with pleasure.
It's bad to crawl.
I only have one minute.
Tom's never giving up.
I think Tom's a conservative.
How long are you guys?
I'd like a little bit of a question.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what's going to happen to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's getting mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom cheated on us.
What did I say?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom's only gonna tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The seller cheated on him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid the penalty.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at 10?
It's closed today.
Please let him know, Tom.
I'll make her help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's going to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple thing.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to look at her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing the new version of Tatooine.
Seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did he really do that, Tom?
Damn, I didn't know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was an honor for me to be asked to speak.
Tom's not a sportsman.
I'm stuck, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Get your horses out.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom was feeling very lonely.
I’d love to try new things.
Tom was not the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom doesn't laugh.
I began to see him.
We'll be quick.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
He did a miracle.
The glands lick chemicals in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's taking a break.
Don't run around.
It'd be best if you didn't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I've been helping her.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's overly gifted.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bicycle.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Come on over here!
You could've refused.
Why don't you let me help?
It's gonna happen soon.
Hey, it's congestive here, get me out of here before I drown.
It's gonna happen what it's gonna happen.
I've heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there alone?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many of the philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was being polite.
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay, whatever you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak more loudly?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play "Truth or Challenge".
Its conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom began to read the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom likes flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be careful.
I've been misunderstood.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why aren't you listening?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you to be in danger.
I'm fat.
How much time do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife is getting tired of her daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amebs are single-celled organisms.
Tom said that someone here needed help.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom shook my hand.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today it's tough.
I'm fine.
He went in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston last night. I'm sorry.
This isn't fair to me.
Someone might have followed them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in the cash register.
Camoli to meet her.
They were smiling.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather strap.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He's just gone.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn’t sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel a lot of guilt.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll get to the station on time?
It all looked fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive father.
An international language would be of great use to mankind.
I've been helping them.
Has it been decided yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't fool me at all.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom's got mental problems.
Tom began to eat.
She's kind.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Do you want some water?
Tom sneezed at the girls.
We've been looking for each other.
Tom is acting differently today.
Get them off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different distinctions.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer that I couldn’t refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in the monasteries.
Don't be so perverse!
Tom wants evidence.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your pay.
I'm sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got a little shaky.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam included mathematics, physics and chemistry.
Tom was money laundering.
Have you ever kissed yourself?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Did you say you know how to swim?
Don't put pressure on Tom.
I was betrayed.
And he's making paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Be present at the meeting.
I'll find a picture of how you spoke.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb cremenadles, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We've been waiting outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier like this.
Tom's overjoyed you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I'm wondering what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not exactly an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
The French are tough.
I seldom ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor examines the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
Smoke rises in the air.
The printer is not working.
I'll send you to the door.
It's dark here.
Tom's a scoundrel.
This was too much for her.
Tom was wondering what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince agrees.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary was representing her team in the match.
Tom doesn't want a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm single.
We don't want any more accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'm gonna kill you.
Most people have a lot of resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I looked at Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be understood in oils and lubricants for motors.
How was yesterday?
You have to learn to do good.
We can't let them go now.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm making my omelet.
Tom also explained to Mary the rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They got it, didn't they?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remains unanswered.
Tom thought Mary was going to enjoy the concert.
I took out my knife.
They're dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at 10:30.
I don't know where it went.
There's a boy coming up to me.
Tom now looks very tired.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom was calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living things.
They're entertaining her.
I need to go change my clothes.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died one day after the birth of my older sister.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
He chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he didn't know how to swim.
Tom quickly got lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still at work.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
Don't surprise me.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a lethal, sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why are you smiling when we're kissing?
Someone's gonna see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally smiled.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would you like that, Tom?
I misjudged it.
Just a little while, and it'll be over.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my dad?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom Ritchie.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her a little privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a filgian coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can get him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
God created the seed.
It's not too early.
Can I eat it?
They painted the frames of the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car. You can use this car.
I'm glad to hear that.
How to applaud.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one is talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
You and I will be on the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll bring the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
An hour before the event.
You were unbelievable.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raises the branch with the clutch and flies to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
He's not the same guy as he was three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to set aside time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to get rid of himself.
What am I gonna give them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home by noon.
I think it's time we started to stop.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
Tom runs past Mary's.
I was raised by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is, how did Tom do that?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a swimsuit?
His nose is the best of all.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has brown hair.
Long live the USSR!
Epten is strong.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
The simple question is de.
The bushes are burning.
Tom was affected.
I'm being bitten by a conscience.
How did you know Tom was going to expose me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom is drunk with tequila.
My grandmother is deaf, in other words, a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're getting pretty hot.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a slime on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I respect you.
Be kind to me.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
They're mine.
Was the trip nice?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom's out.
This is the king's most trusted adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really pissed.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
- Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I gonna get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed the job.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to light your car.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
She was lying to me.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to make fun of you.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware that Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just cross Tom.
Maybe I should help her out.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I taught him out of the blue.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
It's a little loud, so speak louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's going south.
“Love is like oxygen.
They're for you now.
That's a very vague explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It is too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't it terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself last night.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt all at once.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The dinner was very good!
Take control of yourself.
Multiplication is commutative and division is not.
I'm in trouble.
Tom took off his hat and bowed down.
He's missing oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what he wrote in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom was very shy.
It was Bether.
Tom's starting to cry.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed to her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll get there on time.
Tom was crazy.
Limenkava is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why are you asking me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his hand.
Einstein considered himself to be a philosopher.
My pair smashed my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the beer flag?
Relax! Relax!
I told you it would be hard to do.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom has been without food for a week.
I don't understand you.
Even though I'm a devout man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologizes for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
She deserves the award.
Can we talk, please?
Where have we gone?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
There's something we need to test.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm good!
Who said something?
Tom began to say something, but Mary hugged him.
We met in Meana.
How was Tom doing?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing to drink.
I've turned the whole town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York City.
Please come in.
The drug must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
My blood's down.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was damned.
You baked a loaf of bread.
Pigs of marzipan do not grit.
Tom's on his own.
Tom angered Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
That's what Tom is about.
Tom might be here today.
There is no difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help me?
Don't let me down.
Tom wasn't home when I came back.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, one more time.
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom's acting sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
He used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think there's a cure for that yet.
Each member must be present.
She didn't understand the joke.
This is the hottest snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must've jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand her name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me pass the message on to Tom.
Where's my bag of golf gear?
Read these instructions . . .
We're not criminals.
Wheat is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are very cute together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's possible I'm not right.
What is Happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You squeezed your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pencil.
Tom is blind.
Do you really believe a guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was horny.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was cooking something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop along the way.
I heard Tom yelling.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves because of that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave it to me.
The stone slid down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's out of his mind.
Come on again!
He doesn't like his heart.
There is no need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
Penguins are very cute.
You're a tough guy.
Sorry, but we do not accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look jagged.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of the house with my panties.
I think Tom's a jackass.
He suffered from a terrible infection and the ovary and flowed.
I don't need advice.
That doesn't make it.
He's not coming around.
Tom pointed to the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's acting weird sometimes.
We'll hang them.
Now is probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very, very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in the Justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take it?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're an influence.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake the cake from the buns?
I need a secretary.
This girl's the smartest.
I had to protect him, Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the topic.
She really likes to talk.
I have a question for Tony.
This is an interesting, funny, and even terrifying story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language has a different view of the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
Nawaka.
This is a holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We've got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, they live?
This was at the top of the cup.
I'm ready for that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He is an impious.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we got married.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for democracies?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you intrigued by him?
We just found them.
I've been biting my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked the cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in the room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've stabbed your jaw.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little enchanted.
