Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned that they "seem like fools"
Some members of the Assembly have expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This has come as a result of plans to change the assembly's name to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the Assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this could provoke turmoil.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "tank".
A Welsh Party MP said the group was "dissatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" about the name change, but said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the pronunciation of the germ "w" in Welsh is similar to that of the germ "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on the announcement of the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on the appointment of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 law gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation, and the latter's proposal to designate the assembly as the "Parliament of Wales" found widespread support.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission favoured the appointment of "Members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a public consultation.
As it appears, members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative choices, but the fight for consensus could turn into a headline for President Elin Jones, who is expected to table legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the way the assembly functions, including rules for the exclusion of the members of the Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain with the Members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote on the change of their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia itself.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim over its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will not recognize the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a price to be paid for membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's chambers fall silently, while churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historically, the elderly people I've spoken to say that there was a bar and a church on every brow," Adams said.
"They're both missing today."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“These days, people are socialized in other ways,” he says.
"Bars are no longer meeting points in the neighborhood, where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential palaces full of people who will not support the holy places that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming number of people who buy living environments in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon the day will come when these churches will close once well, since it is payable for the majority of people who settle in these apartments to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem was transformed into a metropolis of people of color - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a congregation of people of color, who had had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin passed a congregation of people of color under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street of shops in Harlem, which did not accept to employ or promote people with.
In 1939, the building was barely damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's celebrities made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the caravan "the camp of the poor."
The expert who played in his career in July called it something completely different: "a cultural treasure" and an "indispensable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first career in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger career at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin hadn't replaced him.
The events of recent months in St. Martin have been a complicated narrative of architects and contractors, some sent by the lay leaders of the church and others from the episcopal diocese.
The Council - the leading body of the familiy, composed of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, with concern that it "will try to transfer the costs" to the familiy's council, despite the latter being not included in the work of scholars and scholars.
Some celebrities complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old fisherman injured during a dive to catch a cage in California
A fisherman attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived to catch a cage in California on the day of the opening of the cage season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then drove toward him along with a group to get him out of it.
Hammel said he had initially thought the boy was just exaggerated by the catch of some booze, but then "I realized that he was yelling "Animate me!
You've ruined me!"
Hammel says that when he arrived at the boy, without his entire keyboard being torn off.
"I shouted to all the people to come out of the water, 'There's a fish in the water!'
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was declared in critical condition.
The species of fish responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said at a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was identified as a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
Officials banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 species of fish in the area, but most are considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with large store-style cosmetic pavilions, with a specialized sales staff.
As part of a considerable effort to enter the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashionable clothing and household appliances plummet in many years, the two largest cosmetics retailers will be tested in the next year.
Investing in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves spaces that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its range of cosmetic products to up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, with areas dedicated to related brands, similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Also, the supermarket will once again launch its boutique line of cosmetics, so that most of the products are vegan - something that is in demand more and more from the younger age shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer "Fragrance Shop" will test concessions at two of Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open on Friday.
Online shopping and a trend toward daily buying small amounts of food in the neighborhood's stores mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, has said outlets will begin to look more and more like big stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight down Aldi's and Lidl's prices with more and more products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has introduced a series of Habitats since the purchase of the two networks two years ago, which, according to him, has boosted food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to restructure its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership disbanded after a debate on how to split income from pharmacies in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business to Celesio's 281 stores, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look of our cosmetics pavilions to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialised training staff, who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands has been designed to suit any need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations show that we are now a luxury cosmetic destination, which distinguishes us from the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones 'dismissed' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has left the show after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on TV's "Specer" and "Marx" new contracts.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home appliances and accessories "Truly".
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of "This Morning" turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby incarnated Dragons Den star Peter Jones after withdrawing at the last minute from their lucrative business to dedicate a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "shocked" when the television's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals had "worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million" to their creditors, and that it meant more than that.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was projected to double its estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce her departure from "Truly," Jones flew outside the UK to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truely was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future that would accompany her over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has left all the people involved absolutely intimidated.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to opening.
In the offices in Marlow there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to sell."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of "This Morning," which is among the UK's most successful stars, could cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to bed linen and household appliances and appliances.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its director in March.
The couple spend their holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
"I fell in love and then I fell in love"
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the news media because of a comment some would call "not worthy of a president" and because of the positivity about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was imitating the voices of news reporters.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after their first meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's nuke-clearance.
Negotiations for nuclear weapons have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday saying that the North did not see any "corresponding U.S. response" from the North.
On the contrary, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping it under pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his speech at the meeting.
"We're doing the best with North Korea," he said.
"We were entering a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We've got a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - a halt to missile testing, aid in the release of hostages, and the return home of the rest of the U.S. military.
In his speech about his relationship with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It's very simple to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's quake and earthquake destroy an island, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the relocation of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster has been declared, which constitutes a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it clear in many cases that they are not seeking international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it's still unclear if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Given the frequent landslides that Indonesia suffers, the country remains quite unprepared in the face of the anger of nature.
While shelters have been built in Aceh, they are hardly accessible to other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren to warn of a crawl in Palu, despite having issued a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best conditions, it is difficult to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make the logistical system even more complex.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is traveling to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive in the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo used improving Indonesia's key infrastructure as the focal point of his election campaign, and has invested a generous amount of money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has worried Mr. Joko's administration, as he is facing new elections that will take place next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after clashes between Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where snipers, arrows, and other cold weapons have been used.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores an equaliser goal against Chelsea in the last minutes
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a chase from Jerdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal, while his team was losing with a score of 1-0.
He pushed the ball slightly to his left before making a knock at the far gate.
The ball flew over the area until it deflected towards the top of the grid's cheesecake.
The ball saved Kepa Arrizabalaga's air dancing and ended up in the net.
"The goal was to put the ball in the right position and players like Shaq always play with the ball ahead, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch and I didn't think too long but I just hit."
Chelsea led with a 1-0 score in the first half, after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker made a replay of Mateo Kovacic during that game, before rolling around the field and driving with a sprint towards Liverpool's semi-final.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical chase that took Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense in the speed duel and with a left-handed kick scored in the second pillar, passing the ball behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the national disaster agency in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have remained trapped under the ruins of buildings demolished by the 7.5-faced earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 inhabitants, is believed to be under the ruins of excavated buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder after Woman Finds Death from Knife Injury
A murder investigation has been announced after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called on the residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to appear for evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to call any person who has been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
"I would also like to call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken film footage, to contact us as they may have essential information for our investigation," he said.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a resident of Birkenhead and her body has been found inside a residence.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman had arrived on the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, as police say they are informing the victim's family.
A resident taxi driver at Grayson Mews has attempted to enter his apartment, but has been informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out about the incident.
Now, residents are being announced that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has arrived at the scene of the crime.
She repeated without interrupting the words, “This is terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter and another van was outside.
A number of officers were positioned within the perimeter, monitoring the housing block.
Any person who has information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by selecting the code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the last monument to be touched by the debate on the "restoration of history"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its puritanical fanatical followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "attempts to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the midst of the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure would be embroiled outside Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a wrong sacrifice of Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
The excellent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many think is still worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a protector of parliament from external pressure, which, of course, in his case, was the monarchy.
The fact that this is a completely accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Chinese Farmer's Skin Injured by Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname “Yuan,” was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a dairy stable in Liupanshiu market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A dairy farmer is getting ready to inject a pig vaccine into a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have traveled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of an open pigeon stable there.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody mouth on the stool.
A medical examination has confirmed that a <0xC2><0xA3>550 cow has injured the farmer for death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said his cousin identified with the surname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In the security camera footage, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the news late last night that the pig had been kept in isolation to prevent another attack, as police gathered evidence on the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people being attacked by pigs have been noted before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing severe injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 pig grabbed a Welsh farmer behind his tractor, while his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was slaughtered by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that usually, pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "intruder."
"They just want to play.
They're like little teens... their goal is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's aftershocks are expected to bring heavy rains with widespread spread in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa's power is slowing as it moves toward the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause rains with flooding in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States.
On Sunday, at 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa was accompanied by winds of 85 miles per hour, classified as a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form, moving eastward, towards the U.S. West Coast. While Rosa is expected to approach the tropical peninsula of Baja California late on Monday in the treatment of a tropical storm.
On Monday, Rosa will cause rainfall of up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical humidity with the low-pressure zone will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwest during the next few days.
At the local level, rainfall with a height of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, waste spills, and possible landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause the rainfall rate in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall are forecast in some areas of the Southwest, mainly over much of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the nature of the spread of tropical rains.
Due to the risk of tropical rains, it is not recommended to be carried through the desert on foot.
Large rains can turn the canyons into powerful rivers, and the squalls will bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The atmospheric low-pressure zone will bring heavy rainfall to some parts of the southern coast of California.
The total level of rainfall can reach over half an inch, which can cause small leakages of waste and slippery paths.
For the region, this will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before the rains will spread to a wider extent on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
The heavy rains will spread across all four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. may be characterized by large temperature fluctuations, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference in temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good portion of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to launch in October with warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from the Southern Plains to certain parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature that would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was suspected to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political blockades continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programs to broadcast the turnaround at the last minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to strip him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, stated that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that the number of followers was higher than that of 20.4 million, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was doing average visibility measurements on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Encryptions for other broadcast networks, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers from offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose viewers have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to remain high even after the end of the court session.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced protesters' screams as he tried to climb into the elevator to attend the comedy session.
On CNN's live broadcast, he showed up keeping his eyes down for a few minutes while being warned.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said to him, "You have power, while there are so many women who are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would have more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were directly covering the moment when the Judiciary Committee would vote to pass Kavanaugh's candidacy to vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate over the next week, as the Democratic minority had demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was smart, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview slammed with her on the newspaper's main page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her Brexit plan, so-called "Chequers," expressing that the proposal that Britain and the EU were "abstaining" from taxing it.
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison settings under the charge of unintentional murder, the Baton Rouge Police Directorate has said.
Official sources have released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims had lost his glasses during the clash.
Police have found eyeglasses on the scene and say they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS's WAFB branch.
After picking up Simpson's questioning, police said he admitted to having fired a gun on Wayde causing his death.
The amount for his release has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
Baton Rouge's East County Forensic Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of the death was a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The department thanks the fugitives' task force near the Louisiana State Police, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for their help with the investigations that led to the arrest of the author.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement authorities for "their zeal and for putting justice in place."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-long 6-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had also played basketball for LSU.
In the final season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "sad" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"We're worried about that all the time," Wade said.
Volcanoes overwhelm the city of Mexico
Hir from the Popcatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was rebuilt and 183 gas and haze emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a number of crashes and crashes.
Images on social media showed layers of gold that had covered car windows in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-metre earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with peacekeeping police forces, while thousands of themselves joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote to leave.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peacekeepers, struck with eggs and powder-colored powders creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually devour tourists.
Later in the day there were also cockroaches, while the police had to use rubber sticks to end the clashes.
For several hours in a row, repeating the slogan "We don't forget, we don't forgive", pro-independence groups faced unionist protesters shouting "Cry Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to local media reports.
In the region where pro-independence sentiments prevail, tensions continue to remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence, despite the fact that participation was low, as the citizens boycotted the vote against the split.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop polling at polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued, but was forced to take another stream.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest along with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the fact that in the local elections of December last year achieved a vital victory, although with close results, the Catalan pro-independence parties have had a hard time keeping the hovin this year, as many of their leaders in the country's most well-known non-government and non-government referees have voluntarily left the country.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his police-assisted phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, said he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Chancelling for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the repression that has been made to us by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some people arrested after car crashes into house
Three 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men have been arrested after a car collided several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the main gate and the apartment itself.
It is believed that at some point an arrow was thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's strike forgives Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
The team came from a lower category, Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose his second in 18 games as the team's coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit was decisive as Gary Holt's team equaled second-placed Hibernian points.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an off-field match in the Premiership, this season and next Sunday, they will face the Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But earlier, the Rangers will wait at home Rapid Vienna, in the qualifying match for the Europa League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended the series of consecutive wins to six meetings and coach Holt has not yet experienced the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Cases in the Face of Undecided Opponents
Holt's team should have gone on the lead many minutes before they scored, as their direct strikes caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit poorly on the goal, and then Alan Lithgow hit out in a slip and over after a header pass by Craig Halkett.
The locals were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems in standard shots.
And that's how I scored the goal that set the meeting.
The Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined creating Menga's chance, who hit and scored in the center of the area.
By then, the Rangers had dominated the ball's hold but the domestic defense had proved indefensible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was almost never put to the test.
This way the game continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's kick was halted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor while Lithgow was knocked out by another standard Livingston kick.
Investigations came constantly in the Livingston area and were saved continuously, while two claims for the penalty - after Halket's intervention against the incoming player as a substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hand-to-hand touch - were not taken into consideration.
Game 'Phenomenale' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni arena
It's a great performance and performance for Livingston.
For one man, they played brilliantly and continued to exceed expectations in this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since their return to the top, but a big merit belongs to Holt for the way he has electrified the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was exceptional, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the match.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Although on some occasions they played very well under Gerrard's direction, they lacked quality.
Missed the final pass - only once managed to pass the opponent's defense - and this is something that should serve as an alarm for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an awaits with suspicious feelings in Cologne
Saturday (September 29) was marked by a blue sky smile as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have come into conflict on issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's membership in the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters took to the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also raised their voices to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor adored as a hero by some of Germany's Turks and despised as autocrats by some others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after car crash
A cyclist has been found dead after colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwoord Street with Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance servicemen arrived immediately, but the victim died on the spot.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author fled the scene, which took place on Childers Street, about a mile away from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the person and to notify his family members.
The roads have been closed and buses have been notified to use other roads, while drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured During Rebellion
Six prison officers have been injured during a riot in a men's high-security prison, the prison's office said.
The rebellion erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and continues.
Tornado's specialist officers have been called in to keep the riots under control, including eight inmates who have been confined to one side of the prison.
Officers have been treated on the spot for a few minor wounds to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been mobilized to keep under control the incident that is currently taking place at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may receive an extension of the prison sentence.”
HMP Long Martin is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had undergone treatment in the hospital after an attack by one of the inmates.
And in October last year, officers of the peacekeeping police forces were called to jail to keep a serious situation under control, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which can be an advantage for dry areas)
Although it rarely happens that a tropical depression hits Arizona, most likely that's exactly what's going to happen in the early days of next week, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert of the Southwest, spreading dangerously.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued immediate flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, City, Lake Flagstaff, and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to head for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching in the early hours of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have received storm or tropical depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with amounts isolated up to 6 inches on the Mogollon border of Arizona.
In other desert areas in the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, rainfall is expected to be at levels 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas beyond the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's rains can be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of these conditions may be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently facing drying conditions.
“According to the U.S. Center for Wealth Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing second-class extreme droughts,” weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, still powered by the hurricane on Sunday morning, with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is battling with cold waters over the Pacific Ocean, and consequently it is losing power.
Therefore, a hurricane is expected to hit Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or the evening of the moon.
Rainfall over some areas of Mexico can be severe, presenting a considerable risk of flooding.
"Rains of an average level of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonoran, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico, in the treatment of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching the southern coast of Utah.
"The main risk expected by Rosa or its consequences is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonorah and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These floods are expected to cause immediate life-threatening floods, waste spills in the desert, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
The attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of murder remaining in the attempt, following the injury of a 16-year-old with a knife in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was escorted to the hospital, where he is currently in a "sustainable" condition.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials have called for the presentation of anyone who may have captured film footage of the event by mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "faced with the contempt and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a rally in West Virginia’s Wheeling.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "faced with the contempt and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, convincingly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing regarding her indictment.
On Saturday, the President said that the day "the American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most intelligent lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean record of public service," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president recalled Kavanaugh's appointment during his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
"I'm not going to run, but I'm going to contribute," he said.
"That's why I'm trying so hard and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to make “blocked resistance.”
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader's assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were hit by giant waves that collided on beaches when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves as high as six feet (18 feet) collided on the shore in a mudslide, attempting to cause the deaths of many people and destroying everything that came out in front.
The quake was followed by a 7.5-metre earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat of rabies was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, so they didn't run immediately and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian news agency, told a news conference.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it took cars, trucks, houses, hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had touched the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to save the plague and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, shattered bridges and ramparts, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath of the quake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted from Friday's massive earthquake was about a triple of the power of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic position of the city, which is located at the edge of a long and narrow breast, may have multiplied the power of crawl, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "major roads" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
Some bodies were found trapped under the ruins of excavated buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the extent of damage could be much larger along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications networks were "completely shut down without any warning" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
The area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were traveling to the affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for not announcing Paul's tsunami hit, despite officials saying the waves had arrived at the time the warning was given.
In amateur footage distributed on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by on the downstairs of the arrival of a snarling snarl.
Within a few minutes, a wave collides on the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the film's authenticity.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive energy disruption, which disrupted communications across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people continue to have a great need for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is quite difficult.
While World Vision staff from Donggala has arrived seamlessly in the city of Palu, where workers are sheltering in the tarpaulin shelter in their office yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is quite difficult.
Although aid groups began serious efforts to put in place humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being barred from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can only begin to circulate if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we can ask for national help, but this status has not yet been granted.”
On the second night after the earthquake and quake on Friday in Palu, friends and families of the missing persons still had hopes that the case of their loved ones would be among the few miracles that sometimes happen in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of a pussy.
On Saturday, the rescue forces released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachutist team, had trained two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games, which closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people stranded at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an old parachutist professional, I’m emotionally charged,” he said.
Gendon recalls how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the "Roa Roa" hotel among the parachutist community, he was desperately trying to write to WhatsApp competitors from Palu, who were taking part in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a grey-coloured scaling sign, instead of the two blue-coloured ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport, Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate, on Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport, Leveee.
The driver of the vehicle had been emptying an ATM at an amusement center and was trying to distribute other money, Detective Dennis wrote in a statement.
While he was busy with work, someone "came running after Brink's employees" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen several suspects fleeing the scene, but police have not specified the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West is about to change his name to Ye.
Announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Officially known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old has long been called Ye, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which came out on the market in June.
The change came just before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who can't come for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Rather than being an abbreviation of his current name of art, West has expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"For me it's you, it's us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to simply "Ye," which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rapists who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has done as he has done with or without a dividend visa and capital lettering.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, army troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were rising headlong across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving students monthly grants and opening more public universities for free.
He said that the unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education pushes young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount spent on research in the field, said investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have announced discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the lack of the U.S. of an official general strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
“Augmenting the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, as other countries are still far behind the U.S. and we are looking for next big discovery in this field,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book, "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order," published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most outstanding<0x2B> companies in Artificial Intelligence.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed on to the leading U.S. player in Othello, and then worked as executive director at Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee congratulated the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Field of Defense, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to help re-identify the company.
Lee said that oftentimes, U.S. researchers have to work hard to get grants from the government.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Over the past few years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have employed enlightened minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. put an end to its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to people with the title of doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released the Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China offers funding for individuals in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a startup called “AI Next”.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been enforced for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum to decide if its name would be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that could resolve a decades-old dispute in its NATO-Greece deal, which had been a bloc.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim over its territory, and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether participation in the election will reach the 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question in the referendum ballot paper reads: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership through the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, this is a price that is worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska.
Although the referendum does not have a binding power, a sufficient number of members of parliament have expressed that they will adhere to the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election of 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, we have our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko cast their vote in the referendum on the change of Macedonia's name, which would pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union on June 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was placing chairs in front of tents erected by referendum boycotters.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not coming in from the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would “confirm our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - a figure below the necessary level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television station Telma found that 57 percent of the participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
For a successful referendum, the participation rate should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the pro-Western government its first strong blow since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all of Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced all of Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extraordinarily easy.
The Argentine shooter took a mid-range chase at the start of the action.
He smashed through three of Brighton's defenders, before coming out into the open.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green blouses.
He crossed a defender and passed in the speed duel several others at the entrance of the Brighton area.
Then he went to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker took advantage of his exit to the area to follow the ball Agueros, who hit the right and crossed the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball into the right tip of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from a leg problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about whether he would play for about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the first advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball to the Brighton Hemisphere.
He's a good fit for Laroy Sane in his left arm.
Sane advanced a few steps before moving on to Sterling in the second column.
The Blues' attacker took the ball to the net and then slipped out of the boundary lines.
City will face Hofenheim in the Champions League group stage on Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to keep the role of the "explosive" against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the eliminations, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given a chance to score against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff chance for the Rockies, who have an advantage with a match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies reached at least one chance for the playoffs thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to take the division title.
"Although we are playing for no reason, at least we can point out the fans' atmosphere here in Denver but also the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level against which we can face throughout the year.
"Why wouldn't I want to play in such a game?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the headlines on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to leave Scherzer in such a situation to start the meeting.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th appearance as headlines, conducted a training session on Thursday and could appear on the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day off for him.
The Washington player, who shoots with the right, is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 of the shootouts this season.
Trump to meet with West Virginians at a meeting
The president cited the situation in relation to his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"It's crucial for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
"This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have divided their minds to regain power in any way, you see the humiliation of their filthiness.
They do not want to know who they hurt, or who they push with their feet to take power and control. This is what they want, power and control, but we will not give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to make “blocked resistance.”
"And you have seen this in the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "innocent, wicked, filthy and unfaithful."
He was referred to as the Democratic Senator of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which sparked dissatisfaction with the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, no, no, I... wait a little... - her body language was pretty bad - it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an "open church".
She is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for a motion of disbelief against me, it didn't live up to that.
After all, I'm not the first Labour MP to be told they're not welcome - all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way, simply because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, related to national security and to Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy was at odds with the previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year term as a local Labour Party MP, the GC's meetings have been together as well.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "softer and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It has become increasingly apparent that opposing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought I shared similar political views began to pretend that I would take a 180-degree turn and hold positions with which I would never have agreed at all - whether on national or national security.
Whenever I speak in public - no matter what I say - the criticisms on social media explode, with people seeking my dismissal, denouncing the centre's policies, telling me that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who suffered this.
I'm aware that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but don't.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an “open church”, and with every motion of faith and with every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, I've been advised often to lower my head, not to be so noisy, and so "everything's going to be okay."
But that's not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, driven by the Thatcher government's disillusionment that led to the failure of my class in a general school, I've tried to lobby for local better public services - as a mini-farmer for those of us who have more.
"I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clear my political stances and points of opposition to current leadership.
For all those who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services. I can’t understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the only message I want to follow is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be at your service and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political favor will hinder me.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Impossible Ayr leads the lists
Two late attempts may have changed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely entertaining match of Tennent's Premiership today.
Now they lead the list as the only impossible team among the ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful defense and the courage to take risks that secured the home team's victory, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still impossible, so I'm normally happy," he said.
Robyn Christie and Melrose said: "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took more risks than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, turned into a goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to top the scorer in a single-point and number one.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty while just before the end of the first half, he scored and scored an individual action goal bringing the score to 17-5 for Ayr ahead of the break.
But Melrose did well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to score back from Baggot narrowed the gap to five points.
Afterwards, there was a long interruption as a result of Ruaridh Knott's severe injury, which left the bar, and after the game's rejuvenation, Ayr increased the score through an attempt by Stafford McDowall, scored by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was later penalized with a yellow card, and Melrose again exploited the fact that they had one more player, with an undefeated attempt at goal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-pressing piece.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was penalized with a yellow card for preventing Climo, without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a "touch down", behind Ayr's back (maul) advancing forward.
Climo scored and did the same almost after the restart of the game, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led forward striker Gregor Henry, for the home team's fifth attempt.
The star of "Style Game" seems set for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, with co-writer and co-protagonist his long-term partner in the comedy world, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth season will be the last for the show, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life behind Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without going out to sea hopes that the court will pave the way to the Pacific
The Marines patrol an improvisation of the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue flag of the ocean.
On the seabed from Lake Titicaca in the Amazon, the motto reads: "The sea is our property.
"Recovery is a task."
Through Bolivia without going out to sea, the memory of taking the coast from Chile into a bloody conflict over resources during the 19th century is still quite alive - as is the desire to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are much more likely than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterised by courtship, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course, it is looking forward to the result," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the GJND session on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia that - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks with the sea to deliver a boon.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indignity - which is facing a controversial battle for a second term in next year's elections - Monday's decision is quite important.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is very unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that even if, things would change quite a bit.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands does not have the right to give another state a part of Kil's territory, and it has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is coming up with a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of helping the cause of Bolivia, the events of the last four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric has vanished every trace of remaining charity to the Kilians, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, opposed the idea that the court's decision was surprisingly quick.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Kilin" and a chance "to end the 139-year-old dispute, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“Deciding is an opportunity to understand that we must leave it behind the past.”
North Korea says nuclear decommissioning won't take place as long as it can't take U.S. confidence
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never carry out the first nuclear disarmament, as long as it can't be trusted by Washington.
Young was giving a speech on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders of the United States.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of a revival of nuclear diplomacy so far "sleeping asleep", perhaps three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
The hopes that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will make North Korea kneel down are hopeless.
As long as Pyongyang does not act as the first to make significant disruption moves, Washington is hesitant to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness of aiming to withdraw its arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats, which will soon be coming to the streets of your city.
If you want to enrich your hat collection or provide full protection from the sun's rays, don't look any further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of bizarre giant hats for their SS19 collection in the gallery, which left open-mouthed all stylists at Fashion Week in Paris.
The impractical tee hats have also taken to Instagram this summer, and these stylists have brought their amazing creations to the gallery.
The Valentine's special creation was an extravagant beige hat, stocked with a wide shelter with buffalo-like details, which surrounded the head of the model.
Other great accessories included stone-beautiful salmon, a magic hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks - together in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had velvety lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation was similar to diving equipment, also filled with air tubes and water glasses, while another was similar to a causal with melted ice.
And if you like to follow this brave fashion - you're in luck.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon be coming to the streets of your city.
The trend of giant hats has followed that of "La Bomba", the ram hat with a two-legged roof, which we have all seen, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that hides behind the hat's impractical tee that it took and through social media, brought out another big creation in the gallery - a beach bag made of cashew, almost as big as the swimwear model that was wearing it.
The light orange-coloured relay bag, stooled with a relay base and a white leather handle on top, was the most distinctive creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous personality stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer I expect to see giant beach hats and bags on the streets of cities - as the stylist has left such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demands for large accessories."
John Edward: Key Linguistic Skills for Global Citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another succession of excellent exam results, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education at the highest levels, for the career of their choice and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored educational curriculum, we are witnessing how modern language learning continues to be a widespread and popular choice across schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language that they understand, your words come to their ears.
If you speak to him in your own language, your words go to his heart.”
These words are a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of this year's latest exams, we can find that languages are leading the lists of results, with the highest rate of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied a foreign language have received a maximum A rating.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had received a maximum A score in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied A scores for French and 63 percent of those who studied German.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that will definitely be needed by children and young people in the future.
Currently, foreign language skills are considered as important as STEM branches (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties employers faced in filling vacancies, 17 percent of them were related to a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more necessary for preparing young people for their upcoming careers.
With the increase in jobs that have as a condition of foreign language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as the master of such a long-term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov, which included over 4,000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only one-to-one language spoken by 15 people.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for today's children.
The mastery of many languages, in particular the mastery of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered to be most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as the Mandarin or Japanese language.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a variety of languages from which you can choose in private schools, with pedagogical staff composed of specialists in the field.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "armate" them with the skills they need to cope with, no matter what the future holds.
In these times it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered as "the skill of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Private Schools.
LeBron is expected to make his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who were expecting to see LeBron James in his first game for the Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers correspondent wrote on Twitter that, most likely, James would play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's time of coming to West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump kicked off a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five such gatherings planned to be held next week, including stops in friendly zones including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to suspend his election to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control in Congress when my ballots are held.
What time is Trump's meeting taking place in West Virginia today and how can we follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's live stream in West Virginia online below, by streaming live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings at the High Court of Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained over allegations of his sexual misconduct, with the Senate's expected confirmation vote suspended for a week-long FBI probe.
But the primary purpose of these numerous rallies is to help Republicans take a leap forward in the face of the November election.
President Trump's campaign staff said these five meetings in the coming week were intended to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many countries as possible as we are heading into the campaign's upcoming season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who did not want to be identified.
Planned to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's rally could bring back support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia's Metro News news agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate Republican candidate for Western Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team showed readiness to fight as they keep hope alive by heading to the races on Sunday.
After three one-sided seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon, it could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This sleight of hand, is a totally created sporting concept, but a concept where players really believe and never more than in such competitions.
Where can I tell you that this is a joke right now?
"They had a six-point split that has now gone to four, so we can say that it's been created up to somewhere some kind of crazy belief," Jordan Spieth said as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage with four points ahead, when they remain in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth states, the Americans hope that the odds are in their favor and have a lot to encourage, especially from the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and took three out of four possible points.
Spieth has been ruthless from the start of the shootings to the pit and is leading by his example.
The party brooches were added as the round went on, entering the golf ball with an easy hit to lead the match into the draw, when he and Thomas were first two points down after two rounds.
His lightweight chase that gave them the victory of the match in pit 15 was met with a similar rumor, which shows he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your game," Spieth said.
All the players are gone now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple has achieved four out of four and can't go wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple not to get a shot over the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shots over the minimum on Sunday mornings, Friday evenings and at nine second shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way their energy seems to flow to the crowd of enthusiasts and fans reinforces the idea that they are the players to win on Sunday and that there will be no other player better known than Fleetwood and Molinari Golf to score a "possible, all-round win".
Possibly both at the same time in different pits.
However, there are still early declarations of a European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson came out very easily with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-morning games, when he fell in pairs with Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two doubles in the nine ahead put the Spaniards and Swedes in a pit from which they had no chance of getting out.
However, on Sunday, no one will be there to help you get out of your pit.
The four and couple games are so amazing to follow up closely due to the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change there for there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead up to the final, but these four sessions also showed that the U.S. team will still compete, even though some people, especially Stateside, have put this into question.
Europe leads 10-6 as it heads towards the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a key advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the quarter-finals and with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspiring twins Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods to increase their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy that he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the powerless American team in the doubles of the morning, leading to a 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance in the fourth game, winning two games, but they couldn't reduce the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points out of Sunday's 12 individual games to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed ‘Molliwood’, are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opener games after a sensational weekend.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth game, they combined well enough to beat a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5&4 result.
Woods, who barely made two appearances on Saturday, showed relentless bursts of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 games in the four- and doubles game and 7 games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the four-morning match, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the pairs game and took a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have everything in favor on a pretty nice and fresh day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the difference that was to be captured by the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They took a bold 2&1 victory against Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four games and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the pairs after losing in the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team has returned the result after a difference between four points in individual games, although Furyk's holding team only needs one draw to hold the trophy.
However, since he was the second-best player for two days, a Sunday counterattack seems to go beyond their chances.
North Korea Says It Won’t Be Unilaterally Ruined Without Gaining Faith
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the sanctions continued on Saturday, were deepening the disbelief of the United States and the country would not give up its nuclear weapons in any way in the same way.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly's annual body from around the world that North Korea has taken "important steps that show goodwill" in the past year, such as banning nuclear and missile tests on nuclear weapons, dismantling gold mines, and dismantling of areas where nuclear tests were being carried out.
"However, we are not seeing any response from the United States on this matter," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, our national security will not be self-assured, and under these circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally destroy ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual grievances over Washington's resistance to a "several-stage" approach to the nuclear decommissioning process in which North Korea would be valued because it failed to do so because of the gradual steps it took, the statement did not appear.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim vowed to work toward Trump's "nuclear strike" on Friday.
North Korea has called for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said that the peninsula should first give up its nuclear weapons.
The U.S. has also resisted calls for a softening of international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that nuclear disarmament be carried out initially and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling manner, even by opposing the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
"Perception that sanctions can knee us are dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our disbelief."
New did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If a party on the issue of nuclear disarmament would be South Korea and not the United States, it would not be the United States, it would not have been the nuclear-weaponization process."
Despite this, the tone used in the New speech was profoundly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly, that setting U.S. territory under target with a North Korean missile was "inevitable" as Trump's "fall" was "inevitable."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, thanked Kim for the courage he had shown in taking steps to crack down, but said there was still a lot of work to be done, and that the sanctions needed to be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "If it's going to take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Penia for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "enforcement of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and uninterruptedly until we carry out the full verification and verification."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the financing of Penia's nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with New Side at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Penia again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go as well.
He left Penyan in July, saying there had been progress, and only within hours North Korea denounced him having fulfilled "mafia-style demands."
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to demolish a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump had pledged in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Harvard Students Take Lessons on How to Get Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has involved all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of study 'masons' by using caffeine from these 'pays'.
One academic noted that the number one university students in the world, often do not know when it comes to the most basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the lecture course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a lecture on the impact that sleep deprivation has on learning.
"In the end, a girl approached me and said, 'Why is this being told to me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep before - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's general director of medical services, said the university decided to present the course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The course that lasts an hour involves a number of intermediary tasks.
On one side is a view of a convex room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, athletes, and books in order to explain to them the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of running.
In another part, participants were explained how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, ischemia, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with an interactive icon, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they're right to know - as you're right to know, the health impact when you choose to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend ‘one night of sleep’ continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that deprivation of sleep was an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring that you have received enough, good quality sleep should be the ‘secret weapon’ of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because deprivation of sleep leads the brain to a mode of starvation, making them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course after attending one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn it into a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining competing institutions.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students decide an hour more intensely than when to go to bed, and also when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' coming out of the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause the problem to go off the rhythm.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga scores against Gerrard's boys
The Rangers took another hit as visitors as Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerrard a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was seeking to record his first win since the February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second loss in 18 games to Gerrard as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the Premier's head coach.
Menga scored seven minutes before finishing the first half and with a placement by the Rangers team that seemed completely powerless to match.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is directly behind Hibernian for goal difference.
Rangers can expect more trouble as their wingman Calum Spence was treated for a blow to the head after being hit by an object likely thrown by visiting fans.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, put on the same 11-yard field that kidnapped a Hearts point last week and that he would be pleased with the way his well-organized team drowned opponents in each round.
Rangers may have dominated holding the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in possession.
They should have scored just two minutes from the start of the match, when Menga's first follow-up to Scott Pittman's Allan McGregor-protected goal square wasn't exactly used by him by shooting the ball out.
A long cross from hitting the penalty by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only shot him out at the back of the gate.
The Rangers took control of the game but it seemed that they hoped more than they really believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after four hours of play while he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers managed to score two goals in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly wasn't worried by Lassana Coulibaly's head-to-head and Ovie Ejaria's no-force hit.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was being seen on the pitch, no one can deny that they deserved it just for the pitch they showed.
Again, the Rangers failed in the long-distance service for the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept the calm to pass Menga and to score in a simple way.
Gerrard acted on the break between the parts while replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change almost did not give an immediate effect as the side followed for Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran out of his position to block him.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play as they wanted, where Lithgow and Halkett spent long balls with each other from time to time.
Holt's team could extend his lead to the final stage, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow shot out of a ball taken from the corner kick.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later claimed another penalty during the game, while he was mixed up with the Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the advantage.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger meter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, as today 136 years ago and ON THE WAY... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for the detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger measurement.
A major pillar of science since then, Geiger's measurement has become a major pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film The Colors of Coronado, with a cast of not-so-professional actors such as Roy Rogers and Dale.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger gauge used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
"When you put these headsets on, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "separate" evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They may ‘disconnect’ a protein that is commonly found in many cancers and then be re-injected
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients who have some types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, observed that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they ‘distinguish’ a protein that is commonly found in some types of cancer called HER2, and then in the re-injection of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increases the growth of some types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared on a Pro-Trump show, wearing a cape with the MAGA caption, following his appearance on SNL.
It doesn't go well
Kanye West was stunned by protests in the studio during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live, after a disappointing performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called “Ghost Town,” where he was holding on to a caption that read “Make America Great,” he continued to speak to us strongly against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Whenever I talk to a white person and they say to me, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched the show with a parody starring Matt Damon, where Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony came into play before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's harsh speech recordings were uploaded on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock is trying to mess with West with that post or not.
West also complained to spectators that he had spent a difficult time behind the scenes because of what he had put on his head.
"They put me in the back seat.
They told me, ‘Don’t go out on the stage with that hat on your head.’
They've hurt me!
And then they tell me I'm a fundraiser," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the fundus?", expressing that "I put my superhuman hat on my head, because it shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try out the love."
His comments were whispered at least twice by spectators and SNL cast members seemed to feel ashamed, reports Variety, where one person told the newspaper: "The whole studio fell silent."
West was named as a late substitute instead of Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: the THANK YOU FOR TURM BALL."
But broadcast moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just herself and that's extraordinary."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying music or clothing or supporting his 'art'), who I believe is ashamed of and who spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
while he's free.
That's how we are," she added.
Before the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was already "the one who was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend Snoop Dogg named him Snoop Lion and also the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harington, gifted with toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword in the character Jon Snow, in the violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has slammed the stereotype of the male hero, saying that the appearance of such roles on the screen, makes young boys perceive that they must behave as strong to be respected.
Speaking about The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt it was "important enough" to resolve the matter.
"Personally, I feel quite important about this issue at the moment - where have we been wrong with the appearance of masculinity?" he said.
"What have we learned to men as they grow up, about the problems we're starting now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the overly masculine characters that appear there.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and what is learned on the street, which makes young boys believe that they must behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because obviously something's gone wrong with the young boys.'
During the interview he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for "Game of Thrones" as the series ended at the end of next summer, saying that "the battles and horses have come to the top of his nose."
From November, Kit will take part in a remake of Sam Shepard’s ‘True West’, which is the story of a filmmaker and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever gotten from Game of Thrones.
"In this production I found the wife, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and defined my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the award-winning science-fiction series Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected across the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, showing a difference from the past . . .
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving HIV through this method had almost gone to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but is said to still dominate discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
The majority of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inappropriate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to medical supplies for the treatment of HIV as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators’ data has been disseminated by staff members, saying these are ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiracy theory’
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats said the allegations were being pushed by experts and the "right-wing extremist" website.
"Lies, lies, and just disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate panel on sexual misconduct against High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The robbery of information came shortly after the three senators had received Kavanaugh's question.
Some conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the publications were linked to the Waters office and extracted data from a Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"This baseless claim is totally untrue and a big lie," Waters said.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these false and misleading claims - has in no way been responsible for the leakage of this information.
"This unfounded claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement immediately faced online criticism, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial becomes frustrating," Fleischer wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't get upset.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
He needs to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is competing to take over Waters in the mid-term election, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"A big case, if it's going to be true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had signalled "relevant authorities and law-enforcement institutions over these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the authors are revealed," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a devastating and dangerous effect on anyone from my staff."
Review of the film "Johnny English Hits Again" - comedy with unequipped spy material Rowan Atkinson
It has become a coincidence that in every new British-influenced film, it is seen for hidden messages related to the theme of Brexit and this is also applicable in the revival on the scene of the comedy-action comedy-action "Johnny English" - which debuted in the year of "Johnny" in 2003 with "Johnny English" and "Rich English".
Will this satirical comedy show how clearly incapacitated we are with the new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the character with the eye of the country, with his face like a rubber and in the appearance of Johnny English's watchman, has been given permission to confuse things a second time - his name, which indicates more than anything else that he sleeps, but he doesn't sleep.
Of course, he's a manga secret agent, who despite surprisingly claiming to appear as a charmer, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean's character, and a portion of that type of loner who only contributed to Lorelei's 2012 song, 'Oli' in the song 'Cheriots'.
It is also based on mystery man, traveler and internationaler Atkinson, who once played in television commercials that are now forgotten about the Barclaycard, leaving the place in chaos wherever it was.
There are a couple of great moments at the premiere of this movie.
I liked it a lot when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval parcel and the helical sheet collided slightly in his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy comes to mind, but the humor seems vague and sometimes exaggerated, especially when 'serious' films like 007 and Mission Impossible have even introduced a bit of comedy as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to be aimed at children more than adults, and Johnny English's crisp events are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as those that Atkinson performs in Bean's character.
The main theme of this film is the fact that the UK is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British agents, uncovering the identity of the British field agents and slandering the agent on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister to appear as a pompous, battle-ready figure who is already suffering an extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best to realize the character that looks like Teresa May, but there isn't much text on the screen that she can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she'll have to rely on someone who's retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-level neighborhood, but who informally taught how to become a secret agent: here are beautiful scenes, because English is offering an espionage academy in the form of a school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and reunited with his ex-boyfriend, multiplayer Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-ranking girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has been misused for this role.
So Batman and Robin doing things totally backwards in His Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, battling the fateful beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is captivated by the attractive tech billionaire who claims he can solve the difficulties of British computers: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their funny and deceptive odyssey: masked as a cameraman, set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; cause chaos as they unlicensedly enter the luxury yacht of Volta; and English blends in completely as he tries to use Voltual's virtual reality gadgets.
All the sequences are usually made for the final scene, but despite it's fun and loud, the whole thing looks a bit like a children's movie.
It's pretty moderate stuff.
As in other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Is there not a role for Rowan Atkinson in the British film industry that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies it has a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days.
The Labour party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week - but pay for five.
The party is reported to want company leaders to save by using the AI revolution for employees, giving them an extra day's rest.
We'd see that employees would enjoy a three-day weekend off - but continuing to bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would “compate” with the party’s economic agenda and plans to return the country in favor of workers.
Moving to a four-day week of work is an idea that has been embraced by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced.
"It's not going to happen immediately, but a four-day week of work is an aspiration that matches the party's approach to balancing the economy in favor of workers and also the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party has previously pledged a four-day week of work during the general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A week with four working days is not the party's policy and is not being taken into account by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour party conference to convey his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to pass power from “anonymous directors” and “beneficiaries” to public service firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all of their shares, because the Labour government may carry out a "downturn" with the justification of actions deemed to be infringing.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of companies and to set up All-Inclusive Ownership Funds to pass on employees 10 percent of private-sector firm capital, which means a dividend paid annually in value up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy show in '60 Minutes' whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raised questions about whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could affect any Republican senator to withdraw.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his college from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that when I was entering the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got it on the phone after this happened, so after the claims came out and I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was very clear and clear."
Graham's voice appears to be engraved on the stone.
"I've divided my mind on Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see that it's going to change anything."
What is the "Global Citizen" Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the "Global Citizen" Festival, an annual musical performance that contains a large and impressive list of stars who perform and also have an equally impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host crowds of thousands at the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be aware of the true purpose of the show at the end of the 30th anniversary.
The Global Citizen Festival, which launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the show (except when you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a set of duties, or "actions" such as voluntary work, sending an e-mail to the next person who delivers it to a world leader, making it a phone call, or sending it to the next person.
But how successful was the "Global Citizen" Festival when there were 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince those who ask for these interventions, or is it just another case of what's known as "click activism" - people who feel like they're making a real change on Twitter by clicking under.
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" is said to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving them a push for different goals.
These actions are said to have helped motivate world leaders to declare policy commitments worth $37 billion, which are said to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have made a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include "The Power of Nutrition," a UK-based partnership of investors and enforcement agencies, committed to "unleashing these children to grow up in this country with their full potential" and promising to give them $35 million in cash.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a memory of the past," the 2018 "Power of Nutrition" ambassador told the crowd at a live concert in London.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government declared funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition," which will affect the 5 million women and children we have.
In an answer to the most frequently asked questions on their website, they asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will beat and we will fail.
But as every high civil right, and as the movements against the apartheid before us, we will come out of it, for together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the actors who will perform at this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to "block" Russia's energy exports
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If necessary, Washington could rely on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from spreading through markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there is a way to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block them, in order to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity carried out by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization that has personified itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that these approaches are virtually the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is little or no utilization and substitution of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "deceptive mess" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has embarked on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "improper" project of the "Nord Stream 2" gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is supposed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to bring it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
The U.S. position has sparked opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" whether to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" taking part in the race for president after the midterm elections.
During a city meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our destroyed government, and that includes putting a woman at the top," she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take my candidacy for president seriously."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a rally in the city, saying he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a press conference on Friday, Warren said "we certainly need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large proportion of Warren's own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for running, with 38 percent backing a possible candidate and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed to race in 2020 include former/president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cited the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Palin in the Trump campaign.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being called to the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's back, he can connect with other families who feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told participants in a rally for Donald Trump, Ok Tulsa.
Paul called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans, "come a little changed, hardened, come to think if they take due respect for the soldiers and other aviators the country's other members of the army, for what it is."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence after an attack on a woman, after a report of domestic violence and gun violence while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. backed opposition to a new asylum policy
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal objection to a new U.S. policy that denied asylum to victims of criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the county deposited an explanatory document as court-friends on Friday in Washington, D.C., in support of the change in asylum-seeking policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent boys were gang members," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who are supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of asylum seekers in the U.S. because they are countries that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeking policy, reintroduced a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeals for Migrants that allowed undocumented migrants to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
Colombia's District Attorney General, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be judged according to the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure is inconsistent with this principle," the court's friend said in a statement.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the police ban on entry of migrants harmed the U.S. economy, saying they were likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang-run violence, according to a statement from the BBC.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or belonging to a particular group of social or political convictions," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum has never been designed to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
A desperate attempt to save Paul as the balance of deaths doubles in a race to find survivors.
To the survivors, the situation was very good.
"The situation is quite tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she carried her sick little son to an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palus.
"The ambulance takes the troops every minute.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants were seen to return to their destroyed houses, bringing out their stuff immersed in the water, in an attempt to save all that they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-ball earthquake have been flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his back and shoulder, were stationed at the Military Hospital outside Palus, where patients are being treated in the outdoors as ground turmoil continues.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled when he felt the violent quake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was squeezed under the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard the woman crying and asking for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘commitment’ to ‘propagandistic advertising’
A week after a Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. daily promoting the common benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the pay-as-you-go ‘China Daily’ supplement in the ‘Des Moines Register’ — the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of attempting to interfere in a U.S. congressional election.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to increase pressure from China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war that has seen tariffs on each other's imports level.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said China's tariffs in this trade war were set to hit exporters in countries like Yua, which has backed Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Yua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote that, "China is already doubling this burden by placing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the happy American tradition of free speech and the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Contrary to this, in the street newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against it and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the control of the Party of China," he said.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, avoided the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are shifting women voters ahead of mid-term elections following the Kavanaugh scandal.
As more Republican main characters stand in solidarity and defend High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, ahead of some allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will face a harsh reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions on the subject have been high, and many Republicans have publicly declared that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't go away," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill about an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he suspects Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute attempt at an FBI investigation and that this will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “Nevertheless is coming!” as they were demonstrating in the Senate corridors as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s evidence.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach the top," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People are saying it's already been on a high level; that's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among undefeated women voters in the periphery and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even ahead of Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the High Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a harsh reaction if Republicans continued to support the candidacy.
"This has turned into a cluttered mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the National Committee of Republicans, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh is going to be placed in the defendant's bank, it's also about the way Republicans have dealt with this issue and the way they've dealt with it in a bunch of people," she said.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe in watching Ford and Kavanaugh's evidence, with the latter having a slightly higher backing.
A recent survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents doubtfully believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they doubtfully believe it or Kavanaugh most likely.
Also, 38 percent think that Kavanaugh, most likely or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and the other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court, showed his genitals in front of her while at a party while they were studying in Yale, the '80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, ‘Inrupt’, is a company built by Berners-Lee’s open-source platform, called ‘Solid’.
‘Solid’ allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are allowed to have access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with 'Fast Company', Berners-Lee joked that the goal after 'Inrupt' is 'world dominance'.
"We have to do it now," he said of this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create "the creation of their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having it available in a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about the storage of personal data on the network is the fact that it remains entirely at the user's disposal as to what kind of information they will access.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to bring together the right resources, processes, and capabilities to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several developers contracted to work on this project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google whether or not they should present a total change where all of their business models are flooded completely overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post in 'Medium' published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over network bias.
Even as he founded Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the consortium of the World Wide Web, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of networking," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann celebrates the giving of the Victorian Cross during World War I to the clergy
The only clergyman to have won a Victorian Cross during World War I as a warrior is commemorated in his homeland, 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the memorial appeared exactly 100 years after the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann, directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin canal "through a dense fog and under the gust of bullets from the fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great courage" directed the battalion forward and captured one of the weapons on the battlefield and only killed three people from the opposing troops.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were set by a crown after the parade, which was led by the group 'Brentwood Imperial Youth'.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is emerging from the support that is being given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to follow Bellator 206, but instead saw "Derkucen Pepa."
Imagine, you've stayed up all night to see the Bellator 206, and then you'll have the chance to see this main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 doubles, including six doubles in the base package and would be shown in real time overnight on Channel 5, in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the broadcast changed to Derkucen Pepa.
Some were dissatisfied because they had stayed awake all night until the early hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described this transition from the game to a children's cartoon as "a nasty joke."
"It's government rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate for and we had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepa's Derrcution," after.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there is six o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our own time, so Monday with their own time.
But we're working on that.
Trust me, when the program switched there were a lot of messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
"We're going to do the show with 5 games instead of six - as we usually do - trying to give more to the fans and maybe we've crossed the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘inferior’ about his sexuality
Olympic prowess, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand it until he went to nine-year school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking on the first program on Radio 4's 'Desert Island Discs', presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
Kirsty Young, the permanent presenter of the long-term program, has been given a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a disfellowshipped person on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as he grew up he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
"Until now, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, have been the real elements that gave me the push and the strength to hold it out," he said.
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they learned about his sexual orientation.
Two-time Olympic bronze medal winner, he is already a high-profile LGBT activist with a high profile and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more to countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out open because he felt lucky that he was able to live open and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "captured me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he experiences so many things at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same declines.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father did not admit he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if we had ready tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say ‘you can’t be in the first line, Dad,’” he said.
"I was holding his hand as he took a breath and only after he took a breath and changed his life I accepted for the first time that he wasn't unbearable," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - which has accompanied him during preparations for the Olympics and continues to cause him navy.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15, UK time.
Mickelson, out of shape, was placed on the table at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to change his form so as not to turn this historic moment into a disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time that he attends this event, a record in itself, which is held every two years, was left on the table by Captain Jim Furyk, during the doubles (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it used to be for the United States, the five-time major title winner spent the day supporting the team and working in the hopes that he would leave behind the concerns.
Not among the players with the fairest hit even when he was at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for Le Golf National's complicated field, where the long, difficult fields do not leave room for the wrong shots.
And if it wasn’t just the fear of the field, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games this week.
If the Americans, who have four fewer points before the start of the 12 draws, kick it off voluntarily, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, although he can't say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he played today, gave me a shoulder stroke, threw my hand over my neck and told me it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and during this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it worked and so I thought it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the player with the most appearances in the Ryder Cup.
He can mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's gassy, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to bully people, and he's a fantastic guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"Also, I think the younger players were having a lot of fun facing him, this week, and it was nice to see.
It's more than just a game."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the great presidency can disappear very quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from experience that the considerable lead ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup games can be turned into an unpleasant factor.
Danezi made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans and closed the tournament by winning with a very narrow difference, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds itself that we had a great performance in Valderrama; we had a great performance in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with a lot of difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after missing a 5-3 win in the National Golf Class 2018.
So the story tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll go on the last march.
We're going to go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win this trophy and that's our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we're facing - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players, on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this stage.
Tomorrow, we will face another ‘monster’.
We're going to have to do some individual work tomorrow, and that's something else to do.
It's fantastic when you're on the pitch with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, you're tested in your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
"Now, forget your partner because he has to go and give his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope that his players will perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas make the exception, taking three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both cases of large returns of the result on the last day, being part of the winning team in Bruxelles before losing to what is considered the "Wonder in Medinah" of the European team.
"I remember every word," he said when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day of the game, Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we have to have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you take a stream in one arm, put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
"We've put the formation in place based on this and we're going to put the boys in the ranking that we believe is the best, since you understand, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has a duty to start the score swing and will face Rory McIlroy in the lead match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players who are placed in the first half of the ranking.
"I chose this group and in this ranking I believe it covers the entire road in the match," Bjorn said of his picks.
The production of the new German war has been postponed.
The new German navy frigate was supposed to be sent in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era fights, but it won't be ready until at least next year due to problematic systems and fairly high costs, local media reported.
The shipment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new frigates 'Baden-Wuerttemberg-class', has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper 'Die Zeit', citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-shipment problems damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four 'Baden-Wuerttemberg-class' ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will serve as a replacement for the old 'Bremen-class' frigates.
The medium is known to contain a powerful ball, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and anti-detection (stealth) technology, such as radar detection reduction, red infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new frigates to be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, the ongoing delays imply that the latest technology battles - which are said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad - will be outdated by the time they enter service, writes Die Zeit.
The F125 'fatty' frigate came out on the front pages last year, when the German Navy officially refused the order for the ship and returned it to the shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Marina returned a ship to its shipbuilder after delivery.
They gave little information on the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany cited a series of "major software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
Programming problems were particularly important in the Baden-Württemberg-class ships because they would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - as much as half the workforce of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts with problems, the price of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also turning into a problem.
It is said to have reached a figure that leaves you speechless of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) - from the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion that was originally predicted.
The problems that have gripped the new frigates are becoming especially important after recent warnings that the German navy's power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was "finishing ships suitable for moving to another country."
The official said the problem had increased over time, as the old ships had been withdrawn from use but had not been replaced with new ones.
He regretted that none of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg-class would be able to join the navy.
National Trust Observes the Secret Life of Naked Nights
A new research being carried out by a company in Scotland's mountainous areas is aimed at discovering how night-time nudes use the terrain to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help protective activities in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will track the usual night-time nudes and those called soprano pistrelles as well as brown ears and Daubenton nudes in the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of night-time nudes throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using handheld detectors.
The analysis of the sounds that will be performed by the experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of the sounds of the night nude and what each species does.
Next, a report and a map of their habitat will be drawn up to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the findings will show which habitats are most important for night owls and how they are used by each species.
This information would help in determining the benefits of settlement administration, such as the creation of moorings and how to maintain forests for night owls and other species associated with them.
The number of nightly nudes in Scotland and the UK has fallen significantly over the past century.
They are under threat of construction and development work that have an impact on leaflets and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as displaying stickers or chemical components of building materials, as well as attacks by pets.
Naked people of the night are not blind.
However, due to their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of location-finding through sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about night-time nudes.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, speech inspections, and are sometimes involved in rescue programs.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to night nudes in Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of Scotland's ten species of night nudes.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says that this country is ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threa we have an excellent area for night-time nudes," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there are still a lot of things about the night nudes that remain unfamiliar, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more than they need to be 'developed'."
He stresses the importance of carrying out night-naked checks prior to the maintenance of the property because there is a possibility that the unintentional destruction of a leaflet can kill up to 400 naked women and young people by destroying one of these populations.
Naked people of the night are protected, and killing, harassment, and worrying them or destroying their mouths is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish fellow with the Night Naked Conservation Trust, encourages people to become part of the charity.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our night nudes and for many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later alleged to have paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, directed 142 million of his followers, just hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports to be "fake news."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"What you said today is fake news," the Golden Globe winner said five times in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these charges, which they have called “unacceptable reports of suspicions about private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in value corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June, 2009, in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County Court, Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped him in the anus.
The mayor claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said "99 percent" he is a "good guy" left in the mud by "one percent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex but that it was with the consent of both parties.
The mayor also claims she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she was "horrified by revenge" and was concerned that she would "blame publicly."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to reverse the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer passed to the Italian giants of Juventus in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will regret for ever' the loss of the status of car makers
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border, in the event of a no-deal exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, in the event that Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other car makers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also voiced fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said that after Brexit it will close its Mini-series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "as soon as ordered" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU, for ordered cars.
If, on March 29, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there could be a delay at the border that according to this industry could lead to a delay and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, the company said, and as a result production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for future relations with the EU "is built specifically to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must definitely be able to continue what has been a fairly successful supply chain," he said.
Toyota could not determine how long it would stop production, but in the long run, it warned that the increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and consequently would lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a senior union official at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience the moment these jobs close, they don't come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have set out a thorough and reliable plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "suspended for a week" as the fight for High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, the ties between Trump and Russia's aid personnel and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
The discussion of whether or not Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general from office, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, is something that has sparked rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had taken into account the setting up of a whistleblower to record talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among reports that he was close to resigning.
Contrary to expectations, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was later pushed to avoid a collision with a hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of having sex, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There has not yet been a date, it could be this week. I think it could be postponed another week considering everything else that is happening with the High Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace raises the question of why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they draw attention."
It was later revealed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing data: "We've seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask directly questions to the president of the United States, then that's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often, and you've seen that we've done it often in recent weeks, replacing press conferences when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions, or at press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president perhaps showed the reason for this fact, during this week, in New York, where he made a controversial and in some strange cases, in front of reporters.
The Secretary of Health writes to employees from the EU, at NHS Scotland, about the fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to staff from the EU working for the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain even after Brexit.
The Scottish parliamentarian, Jeane Freeman, has sent a letter after less than six months of the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken on board to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens who work in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations have continued on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, drawing closer to making a decision in the fall.
But the U.S. government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that increase and improve the work of health care, increasing the benefits of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury. . . .
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent immediate surgery following a head injury on Saturday, in a 31-27 loss against Vanderbilt Commodores, The Tennesseean journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first part.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before putting it in the barrel and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there is no details yet on the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He made five interventions on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the total number of interventions during the season to 18.
Buyers with foreign nationality will pay higher tuition fees when buying a property in the UK
Buyers with foreign nationality will pay higher tuition fees for the purchase of a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the Conservative Party's (Tory) new plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters.
The fee will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that buyers with foreign nationality will pay higher tuition taxes for the purchase of a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters with promises to offer more affordable shelter and to "target" high-profit individuals.
The levy will be applied to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, while additional money will support the government's initiative to combat lack of shelter.
This extra fee - which is added to the current pull tax, including the increase in the tax rate presented two years ago for second homes and properties purchased to be leased - can go up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this move will accumulate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
About 13 percent of the recently built properties in London are purchased by people with residences outside the UK, which causes price increases and makes it harder to find shelter from first-time buyers.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of buyers with foreign nationality who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices high by buying land but unused, and called on Ms May to give up quotas for affordable homes, in order to fix "Britain's tower with properties."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some attractive reforms for shelter, including rent control and the removal of withdrawals "without cause".
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I declared that I would dedicate the mandate of the Prime Minister to the return of the British dream - therefore, for a better life for every new generation.
That's why we're trying to fix the home market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it's not fair for individuals who don't live in the UK and foreign companies to have it easier to buy a home than working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become something too difficult to achieve, and injustice to the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of the North-East rising club, which currently ranks third in League One (third category), three points away from the top.
He came to the Light Stadium this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was once featured in Representative B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But, as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will only come if I am successful in the direction of the clubs."
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he's not worried he's following in the footsteps of these big names in such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my success will depend on the fact that 'can I return this team to the Premier League?'
"Given the structure and environment of this club, it certainly has its place in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to go there, but I would see myself as successful only if I could get the club back in the Premier League."
Ross has only started his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts management staff.
He then helped Alloa climb a higher category up to the third round of the cup, as well as transforming St Mirren from a club near falling from the category to the winners of the Championship title next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Maybe it was really a turning point," he says, about taking Alloa's lead.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, made a good life thanks to this profession, and enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
Again, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work but training seems to be the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that. I've never been so good and so self-conscious in my whole life as an adult."
The full interview can be heard on Sunday, on Sportsound, September 30, on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
According to a study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has boosted incomes of locals in difficult situations in Britain, but has raised pressure on restaurant chains.
Data show that sales in local groups and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant purchases fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who compiled the data, said: "Continuous sunshine as well as England's longest World Cup participation were expected to affect July to follow the same trend as June and June, where it rained 2, with local sales increased.
Restaurant turnover fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened further in July.
The bars and venues with the main activity of supplying drinks recorded better performance, with higher growth than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
The places with the main activity of supplying food also recognized declines as a result of sunny weather, although not as considerable as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in bars and locals increased by 6.6 per cent that month, while food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, free time and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the non-residential market, the weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a drop in sales by 4.8 per cent a year will be a particularly heavy burden considering the ongoing cost pressure.
"The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a more difficult time for food operators, and time will tell if the more average temperatures in August will give you the much-wanted peace of mind."
Total sales growth at venues and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Industry Sales Tracking Index, for the UK bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children have hidden accounts on social media that hide them from their parents.
According to one study, one in five children - some of whom are no older than 11 - have hidden social media accounts that hide them from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has heightened the fear of sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account that they tell their parents about.
One in five children - some of whom are no more than 11 years old - are opening social media accounts, which they use secretly by adults.
A survey of 20,000 students of the nine-year education showed rapid growth in "false Insta" profiles - which are linked to the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean "primary" account that they tell their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, discovered that a teenager was urging others to "rape her."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the group ages 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted they had secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on Scotland's athletic board
Doyle was elected to the Scottish board of athletics, the non-executive director of the governing body, at the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and mayor Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit tremendously by making it part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to serve as the voice of the athletes and I hope very much that I will contribute and help in the direction of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular expert on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after a temporary ischemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be healed and to what extent.
It took a lot of hard work, but now I'm fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing some hard work today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers to cows shares public opinion
A company for breast pump production has shared public opinion with an ad that compares breastfeeding with breastfeeding.
To start promoting what is considered the "world's first noise-free breast pump that can be worn," consumer technology product company Elvie has released a gas music video to promote the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who need it.
Four real mothers dance on a bar-filled cow-table under the sounds of a song with lyrics as follows: "Yes, I'm wearing myself, but I don't have any breasts" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't breasts, it's my breast."
"Pumps, pumps, after feeding the baby, pumps, pumps, for a month."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many of them expressing underestimating the "wrecks" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Just like us, they should stay "pregnant" and be "born" to produce milk, only that their "baby" is taken from them a few days after they are born.
The Elvie breast pump is placed inside the receptacles and does not fall into the eyes (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "What a non-sensitivity advertisement."
Others supported the advertisement, among which a woman admitted that the song seemed "too funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would have bought one if you were still breastfeeding the baby.
It made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I've seen what it means.
"It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a gas advertising that is aimed at mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like "feels."
This is not an advertisement that evaluates or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the videos, the women's group shows that they all danced with the "secret" pump placed in the recipes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on data that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie pump is noiseless, has no wires or tubes, is placed inside the receptacles and does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move around, keep their babies, and even go outside while using it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Creative Executive Director) at Mother commented: "The Elvis Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and dairy cows, we wanted to come up with the use of the breast pump and the challenges that arise, also displaying in an entertaining and similar way the sensation of being extraordinarily soft.
This isn't the first time Elvis has come to the fore.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the sidewalk of stylist Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of banned migrant children has increased even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively the same, in part as a result of the rhetoric and strict policies put forward by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send the children to their support.
Typically, most of the supporters have also been immigrants themselves without documents, and have been afraid to risk their stay in the country trying to apply for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support the underprivileged.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had no previous criminal precedent.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are supportive or family members of supporters remain in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with criminal records.
So, we're continuing to follow these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to shelter workers, trying to process children's data faster, officials presented new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of the ban, and not after 60 days, as was the norm.
Many of them will appear before immigration judges through video-conferences and not physically, to argue their request for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports taken from the system in recent months, the longer the children stay banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are heavier in larger environments like Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs that a child has difficulty are more likely to be omitted.
They add that moving children into the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, can cause trauma that many of them are already facing.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "conquest forces" to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has already entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces remain on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and that "will act with them in the right way."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said during the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territory" both from terrorist groups and from "illegal foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for the "irrational spread of fear" that drove refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone at the rebels' last major fort in Idlib has created an opportunity to move ahead with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish deal avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the deal had "clear instructions" and expressed confidence that military attacks would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem foresaw the conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "in reviewing the provisions of the current constitution," and warned that there would be no interference.
Why Trump Will Earn a Second Mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals hope, accusations and scandals end his presidency ahead of time.
In what would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic finding of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during peak hours has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million during peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's program, The Rachel Maddow Show, has reached the top of the cable channel ranking with 3.5 million viewers during major event evenings.
"This is a fire, to which people withdraw because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, head of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It brings to mind a taxi ride to Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He had said, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can unite and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that can only be faced by the most privileged viewers.
However, if you find yourself after six hours watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "unsatisfied information" in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's blunt-skinned bomber jacket embroidered on a $15,000-size shirt, The Washington-styled "Stories" shirt.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he does and what makes it look like a 'reality show' is that you feed on something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," referring to Trump's out-and-out-of-the-box shows.
You can't leave an episode without seeing it otherwise you stay behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the weather was sunny and the outside temperature was 80 degrees, outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave, not as long as Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the High Court hanging on the curtain.
"I remember when we realized all those crazy programs in the past and people were saying, 'This is the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector pours into tight competition for Congressional elections
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th area is facing a cash influx, as a result of the reorganization of the constituency zones that forces two officials on duty to race for the same post.
This recent reorganization in the outskirts of Pittsburgh, has appointed Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in the special elections, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12-zone, which has been relegated to the new 17-zone.
This new mapping came after the decision of the Pennsylvania High Court, which, in January, stated that the old areas were unconstitutional and unfairly designated in favor of Republicans.
This race, in the new 17th zone, has also sparked a strong confrontation with campaign funding from the main party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee on Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow-gauge victory in the heavily contested March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
For more than a decade, that post was held by Republicans and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Politicians see the Democrats as an easy favorite.
The U.S. is considering penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a little push from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama as the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to remove U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include cuts in financial aid and certain restrictions on the granting of visas, would be severe for the country of Central America and for its high levels of unemployment and killings.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central American countries pushed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to follow up on a similar meeting last year, a move that was seen as a stepping stone to advance efforts.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, ending every opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to deliver a speech at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, a signal that shows the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys, quietly returned from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, on condition that their anonymity be preserved.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right of anonymity.
study the history.
The next event that is expected to take place may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
Mueller is reportedly moving his investigation to prove whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has cooperated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its arm, Mr. Trump will have to account before this body, at a time when he is preparing to step out again in front of voters, and perhaps eventually face an independent jury.
These are many if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall - or that of his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike the state against Hitler, if the West had resisted and would support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the irreversible course of democracy.
At the moment, the Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation into Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported, during the past year, that he had suggested secretly interrogation of the president, and had speculated that he is not fit to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times article was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed in the High Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false evidence?"
And above all, are we going to vote in the upcoming elections for a Congress that will consider Mr. Trump responsible?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the residence of the ambassadors where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table holding the swastika symbol (broken cross).
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is an optimist ahead of Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers expect Rapid Vienna to know that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a favorable position to qualify for Group G, the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance this season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a push to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the field believing we could get something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have scored in the end but, overall, I believe the equation was a fair result.
"Maybe they were better in the first half as we showed up in the second half and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
"I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they achieved a positive result in their last game but, with the fans who support us, I'm sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
"Last year was very difficult, due to injuries suffered and changes in the club but now there is an optimistic factor in this team.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it a lot; the training is going well.
I hope that we can move forward, throw last season behind the scenes and succeed."
Women Sleep Less Due to Fear of Retirement Savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to be caring for them, very few people spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of the respondents said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them your wishes before.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to benefit from care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor as well: The advisor can help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life-saving hybrid insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance through your wealth - as long as you have money.
Preparing legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Get a health care attorney and appoint a trusted person who will oversee your health care and will ensure that the experts act in accordance with your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
Also, consider getting a procurator for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and will guarantee the payment of bills if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and the medications you are taking?
Prepare a plan in writing with these details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial aspect at stake, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medications will be used?"
Who will take care of the dog?
"Prepare this plan."
A person is shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after spending the night outside.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers stated that this was an "accidental act", which occurred around 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The arrests are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said while the death toll is expected to increase.
With out-of-function communication networks, the aid workers were unable to get information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu, which was closer to the 7.5-faced earthquake epicentre.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated following the disaster.
Below are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800, as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a rainforest stretching over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, a smaller administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and fishing are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, causing nine casualties.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and quakes of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 casualties along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, including the Indian Ocean.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed about 700 people.

Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by Alaska's state police, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, for obstructing reporting of domestic violence and for opposing arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he picked up the phone.
Paul is being held at the Mat-Su pre-trial strike and is being held a guarantee in the form of insured bonuses worth $500, KTUU reported.
According to reports from the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about the admission of guilt, he declared that he was "absolutely innocent".
Palin faces three category A violations, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a category B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of serving in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died on Friday as a result of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the coming days.
The quake struck the central part of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the timing of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for the suspect in a terrorist attack in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York but are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, was alleged to have used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a road for bicycles along the western highway in lower Manhattan, violating pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and that he caused serious bodily injuries "intentionally", according to the letter of intent to seek the death penalty, envisaged in the South-York district.
According to a court document, both of these charges can be sentenced to death.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury brought Saipov before 22 lawsuits, including eight counts of murder in aid of organized crime, accusations often used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack came as a result of "considerable and planned planning," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's way of executing the crime as "abhorrent, cruel and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Paganucco," he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York criminally prosecuted a case with the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
They were both executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan's nationality, did not show any concern during the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the statement, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after he saw videos of ISIS on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room.
He said he was innocent for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not accept the guilt associated with life imprisonment without the possibility of appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says Nigel Farage should be put at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised during a protest at the Conservatives' conference that he would "mobilize the people's army."
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "take the pressure" of Eurosceptics - after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would be out" if the Brexit secretary would be Mr Farage.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces to join her group has been highlighted by the pro-EU conservatives, who joined you in another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is having difficulty in implementing the plan for a compromise reached in Chequers, amid attacks coming from those who want to stay or leave the European Union, as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the harsh reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and chaos."
During the departure march, Mr. Bone declared that he wanted to abandon the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr Farage should take the lead and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were at the top, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers deal."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated.
"We want to make our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers deal is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, it is not supported even within our party and by activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please, leave the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep the workplace in cases where they keep the promises."
Farage said during the march that politicians should "take the pressure" if they are thinking of abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not going to let you do something like that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which is close to Brexit abandonment, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-governing," he said.
Meanwhile, the pro-State marched in Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rendezvous in the city center.
A small group of activists held banners writing Conservatives against Brexit, following the group's appearance over the weekend.
Labour proponent Lord Adonis ironized with conservatives about the security issues they had with a "social app" during the conference's launch.
"These are the people who tell us that they can prepare the IT systems and technology needed for Canada plus plus, for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
It's totally a farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to 'carefully consider' the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "carefully consider the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future during a meeting in the town hall, held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a continual critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was the co-director of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters according to the municipal format, since Trump came to the fore.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and settle the broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top."
One person arrested for murdering LSU team player, Wayde Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, on Saturday, said they had arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at around 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said in a press conference.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the person who appeared there.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the University of the South campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, held a gun, and had shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to custody at the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
The Sims, 6'6'' long, played 32 games, 10 of which were titles, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls in the table per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's instructions give the victory to Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas left first place and nearly "punished" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two jerseys and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and let Hamilton race in "traffic" at the end of the car pile, something that should have turned out decisive.
Mercedes stopped a lap later and positioned himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after several maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave space from the inside after a double move to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first round was ranked seventh, on his 21st birthday.
He was then at the top in a large part of the race as he did not change the tires to reach a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
Eventually, he made a stop on the 44th but failed to improve the pace in the remaining eight jerseys, leaving Raikkonen fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and showed himself to a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these exchanges of positions," Hamilton said.
Weak use of the body language.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump ironed Senator Dianne Feinstein during a rally on Saturday over her insistence that it was not the person who "disclosed" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "lawful, evil and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing about what's happening in the Senate over the past few days, is when you look at the inside, when you look at people who are incompetent, legal, bad and incompetent," he said.
"When you look at the leaked publications and then people say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who put the paper on the market?
Do you remember her answer... did you get the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't take it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn't take it out... No, we didn't take it out," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein sent letters detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford and the document came out earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't expose her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as she asked me to."
I think her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday night's debate: "In my opinion, the cheeses really left to be desired.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen any weaker guests before."
Taking in defense the candidate for the High Court, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said the Democrats were using alleged charges to achieve their goals.
"They're determined to take back power on all conditions.
"They don't care who they hurt, who they have to break to take power and control," the president said in a statement to the media.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored twice for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars compensated for Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants, in the Elite League-worthy challenge, by winning Saturday's 5-3 return game at Dundee.
The Giants passed quickly in a double advantage thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie matched the score for the local team before Dwyer returned the Giants in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third loss of the season, in the Elite League, to the trustees of Adam Keefe, who on Friday evening returned from the draw, to defeat Dundee 2-1, in Belfast.
This was the fourth match between these teams this season, with the first three won by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, by an assistant to Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford gave the assistant to Beauvillier, who doubled the score four minutes later.
During an intensive first half, Sullivan returned to the locals in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted for the Cownie equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead ahead of the break by scoring his second goal of the evening, at the end of the first half.
The locals regrouped and Bouchard returned the equation again with a strong blow at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined by assisting Nielsen, who gave Dundee the lead for the first time in this challenge, at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal, scored in the final.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games on Friday, will play the next home game against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controllers lose their lives by ensuring that hundreds of people on a plane are rescued from the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after he lost his life by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people was safely grounded.
More than 800 people have died and many have been declared missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to worry the area and many people have been trapped in the excavations in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues running away to save him, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the checkpoint that was blatantly moving at Palu’s “Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.”
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could start safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning, before the helicopter got to Paul.
"This news is breaking our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of deaths could reach thousands on its own, while the local disaster relief agency says entry to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to rise, as there were still many bodies under the excavations, while others have not been found," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Dwarves that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass mortuary ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military and merchant planes are bringing supplies and aid to the country.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's army: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out any evacuation task.
"Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says a person has been lost after a plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline that ran a plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia has now declared a missing person, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking in the water.
In a press statement, Air Niugini said they were not finding a passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island's airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collision and the consequences of the events themselves remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after it failed to reach the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed too low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the bell level, he and other people came out to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said the guards were panicking and yelling, while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said marines working on repairing a nearby scaffolding helped rescue them, using an airship to transport people to shore before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 ft) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in collisions with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not included in any of them.
Analyst builds the chronology of the night when a woman is burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office filed its arguments in the retrial of a person who was accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours, in the quality of the expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone data to rebuild the movements of defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that the latter changed his life.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that she had received location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, a fact that dismisses his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's while he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in the Sanford truck that night, the latter said that "he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is the statement by Tellis, who said he had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they only had one week to know each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He hid it from his life," Hale said.
The defending party is expected to give up the injunctions on Sunday.
The judge said the jury would make the decision on the same day.
The High Breed: What Is Hip Hop Consciousness?
A three-member hip hop group seeks to challenge the negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and messages that dealt with social issues.
They want to go back to the original and make it known again to the hip hop conscious.
In the UK, a re-enactment of artists such as The Fugees and Common has been noted unlike artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another man of color?!
My dad from New York sued the couple for leaving work after receiving the "racist" message.
A New York dad has sued a couple for discrimination on leaving work, after receiving a message wrongly sent by a mother, who is complained that she was "another man of color."
The couple has denied being racist, considering the lawsuit as a "slaughter."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that her new grandfather, Giselle Maurice, was a woman of color, at the time she was introduced on her first day of work, in 2016.
“JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her flaw, Plasco-Flaxman, "feeled in distress", dismissed Ms. Maurice, arguing that their current grandfather, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and then sent home with a "pocket bag."
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for leaving work, and is seeking compensation worth $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do such things," she told The Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied claims they were racist, saying Maurice's departure was the right move, as they feared they could no longer believe them after they offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But will you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been shown unfairly, even if wrongly?
Your unborn child? - Yes.
Tell me."
Referring to the lawsuit as a "prosecution," Plasco said he and his wife had brought a child to life two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you take revenge on someone in this situation?"
It's not a positive thing to do," added Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not make connections with a gold that speaks.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"It's a great pleasure now that we've seen Paddington's extraordinary success."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a small toy to write a book for children, would be upset if his work were to be "rejected," adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "rejected."
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of the success.
"He was a quiet person and not proud," she said.
Paddington was so true that it was like having a child who succeeds: you feel proud of him even if it's not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
"Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave his own merits to Paddington's character."
My daughter was changing lives and I was forced to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had tried to save her life but had no results.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me it was too heavy, he didn't think he was going to come out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"I got a call from Nad who told me that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that doctors had given her to keep her heart at work were losing its effect and slowly leaving her system.
She had died a long time ago and now everything was "finished".
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing that this was going to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I have to be strong."
Over time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, lamenting the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers - who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knows," she said.
"I kept my head down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great regret for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Women who wear black post letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted letters with inspiring messages, on a bridge in Wales as well as phone numbers of people who can call them for support.
Mrs. Davis' son was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a “smiling” smile.
"Everybody knew him for his smile.
"People always said that his smile illuminates every room."
However, he quit his job before he changed his life, as it was "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "so that people know that there are people who can help them and with whom they can talk, even with a friend.
"Don't sit alone - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Markun, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was upset, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye and didn't do anything."
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to overcome: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've ruined us.
We all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the thread after the FBI's investigation begins
"I thought if we could give them something similar to what they were looking for - a time- and object-limited investigation - maybe we could bring some harmony," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was "dissolving" among many opponents' obstacles.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want you to investigate the FBI?
They're all in doubt as a result of time.
Congressional elections are only five weeks away on November 6 - if Republicans go wrong, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in efforts to choose the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, lobbying for them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him I met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen if the FBI releases its report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end the situation and confirm it in the High Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea under Kim's leadership
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the United Nations Ministry of South Korea, has stated that there were about 1,127 deserts last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the main factors were tighter controls on the border between North Korea and China, as well as higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers.
Penny didn't make any public comments.
Most of the deserters from North Korea get citizenship from South Korea, according to the report.
Seoul has said that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The bulk of it moves to China, which has the largest length of the border with North Korea, where it can be more easily crossed compared to the DMZ between the two Koreas, which is defended by multiple forces.
China considers migrant deserters illegal and not as refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penia and their talks focused on late denuclearization negotiations.
The meeting came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a nuclear-free Korean missile.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm first," Mr. New said during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he is not worthy of serving in the High Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court's appointee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman were ever brought up like this, people would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very worried and at some point almost yelled or "shut up" when he spoke about his family and the years of high school.
He denounced the Democrats before the committee, calling the accusations against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack on his figure", organized by the Liberals uninitiated by the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony constituted evidence that he could not serve in the High Court, after she showed his prejudice towards the Democrats.
"I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question of whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the event of his appointment, and in the event that Democrats won the majority of seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is ineligible not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Confrontational Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would overturn certain decisions of the High Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say, 'Oh how well!'
And women have to use it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years of innocence exploding, and it fails to bring it to an end without crying.
"We cry when we're innate," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual. What about you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was working in a leadership position, who expressed that she was also crying when she was incapacitated, but she had developed a style that every time she was incapacitated and started crying, to say to the interlocutor, 'I was crying, and you may think I am.
But I'm actually insecure."
And then she continued to talk.
I thought it was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men dominated and where at one point I found myself crying from the incontinence, was the moment when a bigger woman grabbed me by the throat - a cold cold manager I knew after.
"Never let others see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're innocent.
They think you're bored and they'll be glad to see you get bored."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarital relationship on the board of a boat called "Monkey Business" and came out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, inadvertently, realized that there was no reason why she would not even consider running for president.
“This was not a well-weighted decision,” she told me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was in its final stages, she had stayed behind with the fundraising, so she vowed not to compete if she failed to raise $2 million.
But it was an empty war.
She found out that some of her supporters who were giving $1000 to men were giving her only $250.
"Don't they think they're making me a drop?" she asked.
During the speech where he announced that he would not run an official campaign, she was so filled with emotions – gratitude for the people who supported her, angered by the system that made it so hard to collect money and to have sex with voters instead of delegates.
"It looked like I had suffered a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the way the press reacted to it.
"It looked like Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what would people write on the stone of my grave?
"He's crying?"
The advantages of the U.S.-China trade war on Beijing
The first shortcomings of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the war is far from over, a split between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week, when new tariffs hit $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has been retaliated "in nature" every time, eventually setting tariffs from five to ten percent over $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to return the United States with the same currency, and the world's second-largest economic power is unlikely to surrender soon.
The removal of the measures from Washington would mean surrendering to their demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to publicly humiliate the United States.
However, experts said that if China plays its cards correctly, the pressures coming from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term, to reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, taken quickly both in Washington and in Beijing, can cause economic downturns in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the center.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, where you had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
About six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated state.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or aid impoverished by the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup trophy after defeating the U.S. team with a final result of 16.5 with 10.5, at Le Golf National, out of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six games in a row in the European territory and has been winning this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team managed to get the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the player who had the most difficulty during the tournament, took the first shot in the water and closed the 16th hole with 3 shots more than the specified level, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of 4 players who have achieved a 5-0-0 result, since the current format began to apply, in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup final.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't hold myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy that we picked up the cup.
"Success is the team, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to help them," Garcia said in a statement.
He spoke to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated 2&1 American golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that I beat Tiger Woods. I've grown up seeing that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 stats, during his career in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
There were moments during this parade when we put pressure on the European team.
We're moving forward.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12-year-old team played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA in America as well as with our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward.
"I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You have to "bread the chapel."
"They played better than us."
