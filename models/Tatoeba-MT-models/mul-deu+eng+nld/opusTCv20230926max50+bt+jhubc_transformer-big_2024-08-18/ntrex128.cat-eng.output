Welsh Assembly Members Concerned to "Identify Them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen at the root of the plan to change the name of the assembly for the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his party was concerned that MWP would "return to Twp or Pwp".
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the party's assembly Plaid Cymru has commented that his party as a whole "doesn't see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in English of Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualifying to appoint the members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves".
The Welsh Government’s 2017 Law gives the Welsh Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly for the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was decided by "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" received broader support in the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus can be a whole mess for the Speaker of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in question this week.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their appointment during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed this country’s attempts to become part of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, think that the name change is simply the price you have to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Ringing: The Difficulties of Harlem Churches
“Historically, the older people I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there is no one left of the two.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
"The bars have already ceased to be that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people were going periodically."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders predict "and that they will sooner or later return to where they came from."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the type of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and so what they will do will be to speed up the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will end up in these condominiums.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally there left during the 1930s.
A black congregation that was nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the railroad.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly described the railroad as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who made the railroad sound in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first track that was played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had to move to the largest track at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been going on in St. Martin's in recent months, however, has been the complicated histories of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July all expressing its concern that the diocese "took to transmit the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and architects.
Some parishioners have complained about the diocese's lack of transparency.
A 13-Year-Old Shark Ills While Searching for Lagos in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to look for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour diving with some friends on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel says it was first thought that it was about the joy of having grabbed a lobster, but then it was "realized that he was shouting 'They've Bite Me!
I've been sucked!"
He had the whole keychain striated,” Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in a serious condition.
It is not known what species of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles said that he had been working a few weeks to detect a shark in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities shut down access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigations and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK's beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products hallways in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large hallways are just a part of a considerable investment in the beauty products market in the UK, a market that moves around <0xC2><0xA3>28 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and home products sectors are lagging behind, and they will try out at 11 stores across the country to expand.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the avidity of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the relaunch phase of its Boutique makeup range so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two stores in Sainsbury's. The first did so last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and changing into a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day at small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s, the stores will increasingly resemble large department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off discounted Aldi and Lidl supermarkets with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch sales of queviures and increase profitability.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's did a joint-operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it quickly ended up not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmacy chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its 281 pharmacy business in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to Sainsbury’s, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of leather products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product hallways to improve the environment facing our customers.
We have invested in specially trained workers who will be of great help when it comes to providing advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the favorite destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby backs off <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons' Den Peter Jones left "angry" after television host Holly Willoughby turned back on a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to dedicate himself to the truly home products and accessories business.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den Peter Jones star infuriated by retiring at the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report huge profits to her.
According to various sources, Jones was "angry" when the red TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new deals, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, implied that Truly's access would no longer have the brand's long-term product.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private jet to one of his holiday residences outside the UK.
According to a source: "Truely was by far Holly's top priority.
It was destined to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to step back left all the parties involved speechless in the matter.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launch...
Right now there’s a warehouse full of merchandise at its Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment it had made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothing, and the possibility of recurrence.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had been in an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined it as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that “we will not comment on your business.”
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not owning a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, while making a mockery of the voice of a news host:
“I didn’t give up on anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations towards denuclearization, however, are stagnant.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told UN General Assembly leaders on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” by the U.S. to its first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We are going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to release hostages and returning home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded enclosure, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths as a result of a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is very demanding,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it’s still not certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute to providing aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in place, it is highly likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a whole challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had at the heart of his election campaign to improve Indonesia’s poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railroads.
However, Joko's government faces next year's re-election loaded with funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country’s permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative Cairo faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of fighting in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with matches, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores team goal with a shot away from Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from the Chelsea goal when his team was losing 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before he let go of an incredible shot directed at the second goal.
The shot crossed the entire area with a large elevation as it propelled towards the right cross of the gate.
The ball finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn’t think much about it, I just dedicated myself to kids.”
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the playoff, the forward of the Blue team made a comeback to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and pushing towards the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
Afterwards, he made a magnificent in-depth pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball controlled.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish second with a left-footed shot where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, on the other hand, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped among the ruins of collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Finding Woman Punished
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with various beatings at Grayson Mews, John Street; subsequently, a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the residents of the area to have seen or felt something in connection with the crime presented to the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "While the investigation is still in a preliminary stage, I would like to call on anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially to taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car’s onboard camera, who get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman's body was from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigations continue, police have said they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are advised to stay for hours until they can get back in.
It could be felt as a police officer explaining to a man that the entire area is being treated as the scene of the crime.
There was a woman on the scene crying.
He keeps repeating, “It’s terrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the co-ordinated area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained within the contiguous zone controlling the block of floors.
Any person who may have information to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 and mention the September 30 file 247.
The Cromwell statue of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion about "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the purest-style destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor he did during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament against external pressure, in his case the monarchy obviously.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a topic of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle of the seventeenth century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A homicidal pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a carved artery and covered in blood near a pig farm at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject swine vaccines at a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
She had traveled with her cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjacent pig farm.
According to him, in the court there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg garrison had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin had his legs broken and full of blood,” said the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” as mentioned in the news of Guiyang evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, as police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is very rare, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kg grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
"They like to play.
They're like children, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't go with the idea of hurting.
We just need to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, the Rose will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
The Rose had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastwards to the west coast of the United States. When the Rose approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to say in the Northeast.
The Rose will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical humidity will interact with the upcoming depression to generate widespread torrential rainfall throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 50 to 100 mm in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that floods will form, as the situation is deteriorating very quickly due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is totally inadvisable to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can carry wind gusts and dust clouds at specific points.
The upcoming depression will bring torrential rains at certain points off the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation of more than 50 mm may be recorded, which could lead to smaller waste streams and slippery paths.
It was the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Tropical rain-insulated jackals will begin arriving in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more prevalent between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will camp in the region of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be several significant temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain very warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature over a short distance.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of dramatic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
The month of October is expected to begin with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S. area, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many chances that temperatures above the average in the eastern U.S. will be recorded during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was relayed to six television series.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting Friday's usual programming due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out an investigation into the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at an institute party.
Kavanaugh, in an elevated testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this testimonial on Friday.
The company had average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience numbers were not immediately available for other channels that relayed the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the people he sees from his office.
Put in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the chain with the most audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers over the entire day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the testimonial.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they were voting in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being incremented by protesters as he tried to climb up an elevator to go to a view of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake stayed for several minutes with his eyes down while being watched live on television on CNN.
"Here you have me, in front of you," said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who don’t have it.’”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented that he would have more to say in the committee's view.
After a few hours, all cable and broadcasting channels were already broadcasting live the moment the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote on whether or not to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to submit him to the vote.
Flake said he would only do so by understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee next week, a condition demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The choice chosen by Flake was influential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those criticizing her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the UK's future and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, former May Boris Johnson’s foreign minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, stating that the proposal that the UK and the EU recoup each other’s taxes is “absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting Murder: Police Arrested Suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU Team Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who served on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to jail for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to having killed Wayde by one shot, according to police.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district forensic office published a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana state police fugitives operating group, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police, and the citizens of the area for their help in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the law enforcement in the area for his "diligence and for seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He played and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to leave last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team was "devastated" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong one".
“Things like this are what make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash excavated by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods of the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing several tremors and tremors that had occurred recently.

Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police confront Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of the referendum on independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence clashed with anti-aircraft police and thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independent individuals detained by anti-bullying police began throwing them eggs and powder paint, resulting in the appearance of dark dust clouds on the streets normally infested by tourists.
Later the same day, bats were produced with the police, who used their pores to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, independence groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” face to face with unionist protesters shouting “Long life in Spain.”
Fourteen people had to be atheists for mild injuries suffered during the protests, local sources said.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independent mentality a year after a referendum was held on October 1 considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for independence by a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, as opposition to secession boycotted the vote by a majority.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering electoral colleges across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place equally, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narc<0xC3><0xAD>s Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration together with his wife, said that he no longer had high hopes about the chances of Catalonia achieving independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re hooked,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by little margin, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain the impetus this year, since many of their main leaders are in a post-declaration exile for their self-imposed exile or re-detained in the waiting for trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been fueled by politicians from both sides.
“Tensions are only increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting yourself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after dressing a house with a car
Three 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men have been arrested after a car repeatedly slammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone has fired a bullet at the car.
A move from Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston meant victory
Livingston, who had climbed into the category this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what was just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's play marked the difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team came in second, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, in turn, continue to win out of the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers will receive the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his undefeated streak to six games in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still does not know what the defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the direct play of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson paved his way between the defense, but wasted his chance when he was in front of the goal. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out stretching to try to finish Craig Halkett's header pass, who crossed the goal.
The locals were already well advised to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated moves.
And that’s how this decisive goal came about.
The referee pitched a foul against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening for the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish from the center of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated possession, but met with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game,
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop on merit.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped one occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow deflected another match from Livingston.
The Rangers dedicated themselves to hanging over and over in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for a supposed Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another by hand. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top category, although much of the merit has been attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good group of heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, led by a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be Menga's keepers throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Despite the brilliant moments displayed with Gerrard as a coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly outperformed the local defense), and this the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Aggressive reception for Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan, however, moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
The police gave security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, an area with strong traffic in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedic services attended the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway crash on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the scene of Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan police have said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Wounded in an Altercat
Six prison agents have been injured in an altercation at this prison center of high-security men, according to the center's office.
The events took place at the Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, local time, and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercat, in which eight prisoners were involved. The avalot could be contained by one side.
Officers had to be atheist for minor injuries to the face instead of the facts.
According to a prison service spokesman, “We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to resolve an incident at Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees had to be arraigned with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in the barn."
The Long Lartin Penitentiary is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison had to be taken to a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-bullying agents took note of a presence in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which centre staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with major flooding (zones with drought could benefit)
It’s not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when what’s left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rose is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and to approach it on Monday night with rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix commented in a statement that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression within a radius of 322 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Gran Conca, could register from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk of flooding, the Rose rain could become very good news, since the region is suffering from a strong drought.
Although floods are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rose continued to have a hurricane force on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be severe, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rose will head north crossing Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late into the night.
“The main risk we expect from the Rose or what remains of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that rains will cause dangerous floods and waste streams in the deserts, led by landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Detainees for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he was "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The agents have made a call so that anyone who may have some kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone gets in touch.
Trump Says Kavanaugh "Has Suffered the Wickedness and Anger" of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at an election ceremony in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "liked the petty and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual abuse of her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the sight in relation to his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality, and courage."
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable track record of service to the citizenry,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of the Republican voter turnout index in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I didn’t run, but I actually did,” he said.
“That’s why I’ve been everywhere fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicated to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place as late as Friday, an assistant to Republican party leaders has reported to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that rocked the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday on the occasion of a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters impacted the coast towards dusk, dragging many of the people to death and tearing everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately. That's why they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for disaster mitigation agency BNPB, said in a statement to Jakar.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it destroyed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tsunami fleeing a tree and were able to survive, he says.
About 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the number of shops and buildings destroyed, rotated and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water is appreciated.
The raids continued to smash this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami exponentially.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missed.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could rise on the coast to about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information was received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse,” he says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social networks, it can be felt as a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate screams of warning to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts at the edge of the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, the evacuators are still desperately in need of food, in addition to other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely and safely in the city of Palu, where employees lay in canvas shelters installed in the yard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a disaster.
Although aid groups made the deplorable gesture to initiate relief work, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
As he mourned the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing persons maintained the hope that the miracle would happen and their loved ones would evade the devastating account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child trapped in a keychain was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rune for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community circulated, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he added.
Thieves Weigh $26,750 While Filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to distribute more money.
While doing his homework, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote, “Being formally known as Kanye West.”
In West, 41, he used the nickname Ye, and used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which she is expected to release her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," according to the show's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think you’re the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, as he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I’ve gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has chosen his surname with or without a caption and in capital letters.
Mexico's President, AMLO, vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, when it is not long before the country celebrates the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in the plaza of Tlatelolco that "military force would never be used again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooting across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, who is committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the lack of education opportunities and the lack of education makes young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it devotes to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specializing in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Microsoft.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced AI measures, even though there is a general lack of formal AI strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s number 1 in terms of AI innovation in 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the U.S. and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the opportunities the U.S. has for the next big AI discovery,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that outperformed the best-ranked American Othello player and later served as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively assessed previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “it’s not China that takes on academic leaders; it’s companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think that permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art artificial intelligence development plan.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other public bodies of the United States donate money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to that of China.”
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve collaborators from the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the Natural Sciences Foundation is concerned, it currently spends more than USD 100 million a year on AI research.
In the meantime, no measures have been applied for months in relation to U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to “North Republic of Macedonia”, a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia’s applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim of its territory and has banned it from entering NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises questions about whether the minimum participation of 50% will be required for the referendum to be valid.
The question stated in the referendum paper is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created as a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely in the empire of the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will adhere to the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the registered people voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in a referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would pave the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with the head up, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before depositing his paper.
Zaev said a “yes” would mean “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for the pro-Western government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero makes a goal after scoring all of Brighton’s defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling canceled Brighton's defense in the Manchester City 2-0 victory in the match played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a move that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He went for speed between three defenders of Brighton, tearing up with what led him to step on the playing field.
Later, Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He regained one defence before overcoming a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, who with his right foot beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot that stuck inside the net on the right side.
"Agüero has trouble walking," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth on the field of Brighton and
He made a beautiful passage into space by the left-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The forward of the Sky Blues finished the ball inside the net before hitting the bottom line.
The City will face Hoffenheim on Tuesday in a Champions League group stage match at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-offs, there was no reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to come out on the pitcher's pitch on Sunday coming up against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who keep an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a comedy with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to win their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can get out there knowing the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team is likely to compete every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer down if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a warm-up session on Thursday and would launch on Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 eliminations per strike in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump to hold a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We have five weeks to make one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big.. I do not introduce myself, but actually I do introduce myself. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, their pettyness is seen, their bad intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, over who they have to pass to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control. But we won't give them."
The Democrats’ mission, he said, was “to resist and obstruct.”
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he retorted, titled the Democrats as “naughty, poor, rude and fake.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s highest-ranking Democratic senator, which sparked a strong public outcry.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute... This was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party must cease to be a diverse party.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am the last in a series of British MPs who have told us that we are not welcome, to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she protested with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censorship, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues with respect to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham Labour Party’s Friday meeting announcement stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kind” policies has long been forgotten, if ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions do not tolerate the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to take a 180-degree turn and take positions he would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made for my candidacy not to be renewed, center policies are denounced and I am told that it should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they will not stop.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of “non-confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party became more sparse.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and have been recommended to keep my head down, not being so expressive and “all would be fine”.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by the negligent Thatcher government, which left my entire class literally sinking, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a minister or as a local constable.
I’ve never lost my job, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey was not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or any political interest will prevent your interests from acting in accordance with my actions.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unemployed Ayr lead the leadership
Two last-minute attempts distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs won the victories in this vibrant Tendent's Premiership day game.
The Ayrs, who are the only team of the ten to go unchallenged, occupy the first position in the ranking table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to his defensive superiority and the fact that he knew how to better take advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented: “Congratulations to the Ayrs, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put ahead of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Bagsagot did not score a goal.
Climo extended the Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just in the middle, scored and converted an essay to put the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Afterwards, the match was interrupted for a long time due to the severe injury suffered by Ruairidh Knott, who retired in bed, and at the dam the Ayr again extended the distance with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal converted by Climo.
Substitute captain Blair Macpherson was then ammunitionized with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of another man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a plate at Climo without a ball, from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a counter-test behind the penetrating Ayr's mole.
Climo scored, as he had almost done again from the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third line wing of Gregor Henry to score the local team's fifth try.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be about to move into the hospitality industry, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comedic partner.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on it, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper noted that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "florent restaurant sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without coastline, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their ship covered with axes in La Paz.
The public buildings bear a blue flag of the sea.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are emblazoned with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia's coastless territory, the memory of a lost coastline before Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the desire to return to navigating the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a resolution issued by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look to the resolution of the TIJ on large screens across the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will dictate in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the concession of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bol<0xC3><0xAD>ni.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes set in Monday's resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the Bolivian cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has kidnapped the question of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was exceptionally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Not Happen Unless It Can Trust The U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a chimera to think that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration that ended the Korean War could cause North Korea to never freeze.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves before.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest range of large hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the sidewalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which embodied the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been torn apart by very impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the sidewalk.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were stews, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strapholic masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the lively-colored masks had lips stitched and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete underwater team, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like an ice cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that the huge hats could be implanted on the main streets near you.
The large hats kick the heels of “the Bomb”, a two-foot wide-winged ball hat that everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult tag behind the hat was so impractical that it was leaked through social networks brought another great creation to the walkway: a ball bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit that wore it.
The raffle bag, dark orange, decorated with raffle chains and finished with a white leather nannette, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a pity that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Linguistic Competence is Essential for World Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for later and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a higher A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A rating in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A rating.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital competencies that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in study plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Competence Commission revealed that for reasons given by employers to cover vacancies, 17% was attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland, there is diversity among schools in terms of the languages they are taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are deemed to be more important for the UK in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, they will always be able to choose from a number of languages in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global commercial environment of the present era, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still have to determine the minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaigning events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five meetings scheduled for next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump intends to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s meeting in West Virginia can be viewed online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing that began this week with Supreme Court-appointed candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained over the sexual abuse allegations he faces, while the Senate's planned confirmation vote remains pending for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans who are presenting themselves in the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
Therefore, the five Trump campaign meetings scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head for a season of campaigning,” a Trump spokesperson said in a statement.
Tonight’s meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows its ambition to keep face hopes alive at Sunday’s individual matches
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So which side is the positive dynamics on?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a small positive streak,” Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has one advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural screams of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his lap and became a crucial put for the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been down two after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that led them to win the match in hole 15 with a similar cry, which indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to do your best and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all there is to these players now.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't do a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way his energy seems to flow into and out of the crowd, it is reaffirmed that it is the players batting on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who paired up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the nine first holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they never had any choice.
On Sundays, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between pairings, the advice they give and those they don’t, and the way a strategy can change from time to time.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, had questioned.
Europe reach the Ryder Cup final with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave their record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an undecided American team in the morning's fourballs and put the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder's history.
After Woods and Patrick Reed broke into the fourballs, they performed brilliantly to beat a disinflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been drawn in two games on Saturday, showed spurs of sporadic genius, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, rejoined Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2–1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe didn’t have it all on a nice, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They scored a 2–1 decisive victory against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4–3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team had picked up a four-point difference in individual matches, although Furyk's team, defender of the title, only needs to beat to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a Sunday counterattack you see is out of your reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm “in any way” if no signs of confidence are seen
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying its distrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and compromising on non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technologies.
“However, we do not observe any response in consonance with the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally initiate disarmament in any way.”
While Ri resumed North Korea’s known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant for the fact that Pyang had not already rejected the unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S.-appointed president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged bailouts.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first take place and raise the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, in addition to opposing the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party involved in the denuclearization issue was South Korea instead of the US, this denuclearization would not be the result of the peninsula’s denuclearization.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he held last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump's "Mr. Evil" Trump headlined a "ManRocket Kim"
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much remains to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm complete and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously pushed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of making "own demands of a gangster".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took "consonant measures".
He said Kim had communicated to him that the “consonant measures” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on resting habits.
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the ever-expanding culture of studying overnight, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic noted that often the number one university or the world’s students are dissatisfied with what goes into the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the conversation, a girl approached me and said, ‘Why are they calling me now, all of this, in my last year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are explained the basic concepts on how good habits of sleep improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, one hour in duration, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee mugs, curtains, bamboo and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, on how it affects sports performance in lack of sleep, and on the importance of maintaining a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Below, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever-growing problem.
Ensuring that you enjoy good quality sleep for a long time should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in annihilation mode and always makes them study.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to undertake a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact of setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmoniousness of laughter.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston's home which is another suffocation away.
Ibrox's set sought to add his first home win since last February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team's lead in the drift, unbeaten, 8 points behind Heart.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equalize the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, the Livingstons fall to third place, behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face further difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that was apparently thrown from the grate.
Gerrard made eight changes to the alignment that ruined the Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven titles that kicked a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he was satisfied with the way his team, well organized, suffocated his rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder misled and took advantage of the big opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's sharp foul shot hit captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot at the back pole.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a 15-minute penalty, as he and Steven Lawless met, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers led only two shots in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and forward goalkeeper Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' hard-working move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break by changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had an almost immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to catch the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have ceded the direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deflected shot from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton still called for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his eyes wide open.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science since then, has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitting from radioactivity to minerals.”
Evans: "I'm sure it's exploding now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the disappearance of ovarian cancer that had been suffering for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and subsequently re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, “The results we have obtained suggest we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “favors the growth of various types of cancer,” including that of the breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West clung to a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written to the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a make-up cap for Make America Great Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, they say to me, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is not clear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated among the casters because of the hat he wears.
"They threatened him between the backs.
They told me you wouldn't get away with that hoodie.
I've been assesed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" as he said he would put on Superman's coat so they wouldn't be able to tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love it.”
His comments provoked public scrutiny at least twice and the members of the program's team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who explained to the publication: "The entire studio was completely muted."
West acted as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience confused with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed in Perrier's bottle.
West received the support of TPUSA's leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR DISCOVERING BETWEEN MULTITUDE."
But the talk show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their ‘art’) who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
“We too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "to be previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing music legend Prince changed its name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the shooting of a man in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of the swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the male hero stereotype, stating that these roles suggest that young boys often believe they need to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said she believed "something had gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she is strongly determined to face this problem.
“Personally, now I wonder where we’ve been wrong about masculinity,” he says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?”
According to Kit, television may have some responsibility for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its such masculine characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young people feel they have to have this facet of virility?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
“There’s definitely something wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying he is tired of battles and horses.
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best Game of Thrones has provided him.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is commonplace.
Taking into account the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions in sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies an employee leaking data from Republican Party senators and dismantles “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
“Lies, lies, and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person in the Capitol during a session of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that revealed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This groundless denunciation is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, the identity, personal data and security of which have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this leakage of information.
This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters's statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of indignation,” Fleischer wrote.
“It makes me think he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It doesn’t have to be challenging.
There is no question of the defendant’s motives.
It must be calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who appeared to overthrow Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
“We will make sure that the offenders are revealed,” he continued, “and that they will be legally held accountable for all the actions they have carried out and that they have harmed all and every member of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spy Parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this remake of Johnny English's action-comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satisfying about how contemptible we are will be a new opportunity to export the country?
In any case, the incompetent eyes out and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to turn it all around. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr. Bean point and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the inaugural ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveller Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now-forgotten television ads, where it was going to sound like chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last trip of JE.
I loved the Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller were attached to his helmet.
You can see what Atkinson has for physical comedy, but the humor seems rather streamlined and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of the character Mr. Bean portrayed by Atkinson.
The topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's shock, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and besieged figure, who already suffers a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this layered character of Teresa-May, but the script doesn’t come any further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is endangered, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And that includes the evil Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but giving unofficial classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a rock-style espionage academy.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequoia sufferer Bough, a role he reprises as Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little disused.
Thus, Batman and Robin from when things get very lazy in His Majesty's secret service once again enter into action and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous insanity: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French fast food restaurant, they seem to be smuggling chaos aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to marry her.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
- Things quite normal.
As with other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five of them.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pass the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but receive the same sum.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the parties and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The change to a four-day working week has the support of the Trades Union Congress trade union confederation as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at the present time.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that shareholders in water companies may not recover all the investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms’ shares to employees, who expect to receive annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains in "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could cause them to change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be released on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Seriously,” Kennedy said.
“At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was strong, determined, and confident.”
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
“I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it roundly," Graham said in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people you appoint will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
New York City will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, featuring an absolutely impressive star program, which carries out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of the 20th anniversary of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help fight it actively.
To receive a free event ticket (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awaken awareness.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call "clictivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which have helped to achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies comparable to more than $37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.250 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least US$10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the funds currently protected have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the foundation The Power of Nutrition, an investor and performer association based in the UK, which is committed to “helping children grow as much as possible” and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the R&D's on their website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responded, "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movements and against the previous apartheid, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, featuring Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a “blockade” to block Russian energy exports (Interior Secretary)
Washington may "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southernmost part of Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block, to prevent its energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels,” he said, pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 11 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that Energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, declared the Minister of Energy of Russia Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy Seventh. Rick Moscoda Perry, celebrates
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main sector organisation, the FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “thinking” her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "thinking" her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high office,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticisms of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “It is clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters have said the senator should not appear, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed broader support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats that were considered in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially disclose his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites affected by TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enrolling on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“With what’s been happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from PTSD ramifications and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers return with,” he told the public at a Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They become a little different, they become hardened, they ask themselves if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and gunpowder under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented an amicus curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" had assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
They arrested her in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require that asylum applications be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its June 11 announcement.
Asylum has never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a spirit to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she calmed her son with fever in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There is no drinking water.”
Residents have been seen returning to their homes destroyed to seize flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of casualties, and the hospitals, cursed by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital as patients are being treated outside due to repeated severe beatings.
Tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake smashed the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he met his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of being bullied with “propaganda ads.”
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed China Daily's payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's state's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, accusing Xi of violating the bill.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensifying trade war that has seen mutually reinforcing tariffs on imports.
China's vengeful arrangements at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states such as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the longtime U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad, wrote in an opinion article on The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is doubling the harassment with the publication of propaganda advertisements in our free press."
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a payment ad into The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"Instead, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few discrepancies and you will not see any real reflection of the scattered opinions that Chinese citizens may have on China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media are dominated by the Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers bypassed the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans hold women's voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh's disaster, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces various demands for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, not tomorrow, not November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate lobby as Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“People say they’ve been up; it’s true.
But it could have been more so, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote until they like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, where he detailed his sexual assault claims to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts would suggest that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
“This has become an embolism for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the defendants' bench. It's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's stele and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance leaning slightly towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents doubtlessly or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they doubtfully or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or doubtless during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same as Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the lawsuits filed by Ford and, at least, another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez denounces that the Supreme Court candidate taught him the genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that intends to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open-source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was "to dominate the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists of pending tasks, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify. They're all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique to the online data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates appropriate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some staffed developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether a radical change needs to be introduced where all business models are completely empty overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release on Saturday that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the I GM Victory Cross clergy
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren unearthed a memorial stone at a parade Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning prose.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of guns and machine guns".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with the "maximum bravery" he advanced the queue before launching on a single-handed cannon and leaving three members of the detachment in awe.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were a prose he could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who fell asleep all night watching Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine waking up all night to see Bellator 206 and refusing to see the most important event.
The San Jose Cartel contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and were to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, UK viewers were stunned when programming switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted by having spent the night waking up until the morning to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change for the cartoons as "a kind of vomiting acuity".
“Government regulations say that at 6:00 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so they switched to child programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the relay.
"Peppa the fork, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won’t be able to resolve it until Sunday at our own time, Monday at your own.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages that were coming and going, and not all were nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again for the followers, but it was over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but this provided him with the motivation to win.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he did not realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him to win the Olympic Games.
The usual host of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a navigator on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because "it wasn't socially acceptable like boys and girls."
“Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph,” he said.
I wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, not to disappoint anyone when he ended up discovering his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” to other people.
The world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "taken me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go through it when you are young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "his whole perspective" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
Her son is named after her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be there to occupy the front row,’” he said.
“While holding his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had listened to during the preparation for the Olympics and which still put on his chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mickelson showed up at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become an unlucky ribbon.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been usual for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments allocates his time between becoming an animator and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the low point of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for Le Golf National’s difficult career, where the long rough tends to punish deviated shots.
And if his own trajectory is not encouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson’s game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
“He understood his role perfectly for that day, he slammed me in the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I couldn’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I coached and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like any other.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo’s record for the Ryder Cup’s highest number of games played.
It may mean the end of a race in the Ryder Cup that has not matched his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 rebounds, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner for the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players are also having fun staying with him this week, which has been fun to see.
It’s a lot more than his game.”
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon vanish
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the American team, but in the end they achieved the win by a minimum of 14.5-13.5.
"And you keep reminding us that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but little," said Bjorn, in the image, after seeing the team's victory in 2018 for the Golf score at 5-3 on Friday.
“The story has taught me and all the members of the team that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go to the whole machine.
You have to go out and do it all right.
This does not end until the points hit the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I’ve said it before, I’m centered on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have a presence who are our rivals: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by his players’ performance on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I’ll never rush into that.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but individual duels put your ability to play golf to the test.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, take out the best of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than on a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk knows both facets of the coin on last day's ascents, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he replied to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start well, as we saw in Brookline and Medina.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We’ve prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the climb against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” says Bjorn about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not do so at least until next year, when it comes out of faulty systems and a cost increase, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-buk missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these ongoing delays imply that the avant-garde ships, which were expected to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be outdated when they go into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the wreckage of Hamburg's Blohm & Voss.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once it was delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons for his return, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the formation of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, given the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The officer said the situation has worsened over time because the old boats were no longer used, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of rats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how rats use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue soprano and common rats, in addition to northern ore rats and water in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to track the activities of rats during the station.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the rats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed picture of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor to the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for rats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for rats and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration tasks of buildings threaten rats, as they affect the nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as does the paper mascots and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, rats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, the ears are more useful than the eyes when they are to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo localization technique to locate insects and obstacles that intersect in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the rats very seriously.
It has ten experts with the appropriate training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues in the usual way.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only ratten reserve at the Thrave Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten ratten species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Thrave, we have a large area for rats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and even a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of rats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It stresses the importance of checking whether there are rats before doing maintenance tasks in properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
The rats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Rat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
“We still have a lot to learn from rats and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data about their population,” he said.
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the allegations of rape against him are "fake news" and has stated that people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, which is responsible for publishing the accusations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumably, he paid at the time $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video in which it addressed its 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said it was "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is fake news,” says the five-time Golden Pilot winner on camera.
“They want to become famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I am a happy man and everything is in order,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are already preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have described as “inadmissible information of suspicions about privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to reports filed in the Clark County Courthouse.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good guy", except for a "1%".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but were consented.
Mayorga also says he went to the police and was photographed at the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court agreement because he was "afraid of retaliation" and worried "to be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the deal, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to score for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer has scored for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would always regret' to lose automakers
The UK “would always regret it” if it lost its post-Brexit world leader status, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota’s UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has aroused the fears of other UK automakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for car manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Checkers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, has said that members begin to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
Donald Trump’s expected meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “suspended for a week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, in White House statements Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Russia and aid to Trump, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump endorses the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller’s independence, he has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of having a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumours that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has said he would “prefer not” to endorse Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be one more week for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might refute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of informative sessions was not because he did not like the fanfare of the television journalists, although he said: "I will not deny that they are fanfare."
He further suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president does more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without citing any source: "We have consulted this data."
Sanders said the briefings would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they’ll replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are infrequently used.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strangely before the journalists gathered.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service over fears of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wants it to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of residence status applications for EU citizens who work for delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems geared toward the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it’s a tough time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care task, while benefiting the patients and the communities we treat.
Scotland is your home, of course, and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers relay, has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday in a 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodore, according to information from Mike Organ, of the Tennesseean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed has told the press that the injury occurred just before mid-afternoon.
"He came to the band line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before putting him in a bunk and tightening him in order to do more tests.
An officer from Tennessee State has informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center from surgery.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after firing from Illinois.
He had completed five appearances on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK with the extra money used to help homeless people according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty on buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of the Jeremy Corbyn movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher yields.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will be earmarked for government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in residential and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London's newly built properties are from non-British residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up to the property scale.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" from the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a stamp tax cut to help young people have their first home.
He accused large constructions of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "property disaster."
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on rent and the completion of "no fault" denunciations.
He also wants to give more power to the communities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life has to improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home on property is too far away and the indignity of the homeless makes it all the more real.”
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning to the St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once in support and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I am successful in coaching clubs, but.
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coaching role include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names dedicated to such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that their place is the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months at the Hearts Technical Corps.
He helped the Alloa avoid the descent into the third category and transformed the St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
“I always thought that coaching was the best thing I could do, more than play.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I got out reasonably and I enjoyed quite good algid moments.
Playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I still spend it in aspects like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the time I’ve felt most comfortable since I’m an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has boosted consumption in Britain’s struggling bars, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have seen a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA financial advisory board, the company that collected the data, states the following: "The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has expanded more than expected, have made the bar more than expected, 8% of them in the patio, except in the restaurant, followed by a similar pattern in the restaurant in July, June.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of beverages, have achieved the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
It seems like people just want to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, from leisure and hotel analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the external leisure market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a drop in sales by 4.8% year-on-year would be especially detrimental, rather than continued cost pressure.
This long and warm summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food-serving stores and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide this much-needed breath.”
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those opened recently, was 2.7% in July, given the increase in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the UK collects and analyses performance data from 47 operators groups, with a combined loss of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the established benchmark of the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from parents.
One in five children, some 11-year-olds, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a "primary" account that they show to parents
One in five children, some 11-year-olds, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net "main" account that they show to parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which have admitted that they have private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation's directive at the organization's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most medal-winning field and track athlete and President Ian Beattie has described the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athleticism will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very keen to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was barred from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what extent.
It was exhausting, but I recovered from everything, I learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
Thank you for your heartfelt messages!”
A tie ad that compares mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A tie company has divided opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to pregnant cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “first silent strap that can be brought from the world,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a music video to show the freedom that gives the new strap to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of rags and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as "Yes, I love myself, but you won't see any tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not panties, but my breasts."
The return continues: "Bombing, pumping, feeding the babies, pumping, pumping, munyo the girls".
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim to show the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and start breastfeeding to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after breastfeeding,” one person wrote.
The Elvie strap is discreetly hidden in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented the following: “Understandingly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a strap for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added: "It's an off-site ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I had to give it to my mom.
Pumping for the strap made me feel exactly like a cow.
Advertisement is a bit of a madness, but it has to be taken as it is.
“It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented the following: "It's a fun ad for mothers pumping with pulleys (usually at their workplace or toilet and feeling like cows.
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the strap discreetly placed on the bras.
The concept that hides behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say that they feel like cows when using the pullover.
However, the Elvie strap is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a lactation bra, giving women more freedom to move, subject babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s childhood partner and developer, said: “The Elvie strap is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tie is used and the challenges it involves doing so, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new tie offers.
This is not the first time Elvis has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the sidewalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though monthly intakes across the border have remained virtually stable, in part because the rhetorical toughness and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most patrons were immigrants without papers, who have been afraid to risk their chance of staying in the country if they decide to welcome a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential patrons and the rest of adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to accommodate unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of people who have taken in or live in the home of a person who has taken in are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
So we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them would appear by videoconferencing, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered eligible for the aid will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rampages or escape attempts, according to workers and reports that have made the system known in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns may intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, the signs that a child is suffering are more likely to go by.
They have added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges U.S., France and Turkey’s “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eight-year war.
Muallem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war of terror has practically ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and of “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some Western countries" for camping "irrational pores" that make refugees want to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“I’m politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last great rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favoured the opportunity to continue with political meetings.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has “clear terms” and expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, which include Al-Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a U.N. envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government members and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, the scandals and the resignation process end with his presidency prematurely.
That would, without a doubt, be “the end of a more dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in peak audience has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show", has led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers reporting to the main viewers.
“People have been dumped because they don’t understand it,” says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series Designated Survivor, about a cabinet decreer who becomes the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"I replied that because I made him laugh," Scovell told me.
There is an entertainment spot in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go beyond Washington when you find yourself at the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts debate the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", his scarves "Fear", his scarf-skin jacket describes them, and he wears them as a 15,000-dollar jersey (Paul Manafort's gold jersey)
In my case, I will never see Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes me appear to be part of a telereality show is that every night gives you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and screenplay turns of Trump’s show.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was sunny outside the house it has on the north coast of Kauai, but it stayed closed watching MSNBC while it was recording CNN.
It could not be untangled, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we made those sketched programs back then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but they seemed to be right.”

External money floods the races of the mid-term elections in the House of Representatives more adjusted
It’s no surprise that there’s a cash flood in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the redevelopment of congressional districts that has made two current members have to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the Pittsburgh suburban district entails Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after special elections last spring.
Lamb confronts another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, conflicting with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decreed in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a long-running special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians give the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners left the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions on the fact that they no longer recognize Taiwan," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 some US aid of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements, was contemplated.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on issued visas, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll for murder and unemployment.
With the steps of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending with any likelihood of sanctions for the Savior.
Vice President Mike Pence has been selected for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to their offices in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to debate internal deliberations since anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated his statements.
A Study of History
The upcoming event could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in the public records.
As far as it is known, Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in his election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European homonyms, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to take a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and we missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection like this and accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing a number of inflection points.
What will happen if Trump acquits Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water around his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly registering the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein claims that the Times' information is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote for a Congress in mid-terms that will make Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to be in jeopardy.
But I think we will not fail, because I have already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapids on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw on the Vila-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the Europa League G group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until a 2–2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else in the end, but in general, it was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it’s another great European night.
We hope to be able to keep the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but I am sure we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the amateur.
“Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it all, leave it behind last season and have a good time.”
Women Lose Sleep for Fear of Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
Approximately half of respondents at the national level say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents say they have talked about it with their children.
“People want someone to take care of them, but they don’t dare to raise it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
We have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes early enough.
Work with your counselor and family to decide where and how to receive attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover the expenses you need, or an insurance of your own if you have your own resources.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the pace in legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person who oversees your medical care and ensures that the professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of hiring a notary acquis for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of disability.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that needs to be determined, but also which doctors you want to treat,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan prepared.”
Man shot several times with compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots of a compressed air rifle as he returned home after leaving at night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
"Officials have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30 a.m. (in British summer time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His life is not in jeopardy for the injuries and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are cut off, the relief units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important data on Palu and Donggala, on the island of C<0xC3><0xA8>lebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of C<0xC3><0xA8>lebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of C<0xC3><0xA8>lebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebs.
The regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had an approximate population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of C<0xC3><0xA8>lebes Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebs.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, there was also a tsunami west of Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific belt of fire, and earthquakes often occur there.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and caused a tsunami that ripped the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake rocked a pop area of the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake rocked one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that devastated dozens of towns and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled the phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su Provisional Detention Centre, where he is detained with an unguaranteed obligation of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was declared "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he was declared, according to the chain.
Palin faces three Class A shortcomings, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B deficiency, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a drunken gun in connection with the incident.
His wife said she had given him a punch in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her son’s violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebs on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The quake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social networks there are videos circulating with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for extraordinary death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
New York’s federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary punishment that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and hit pedestrians and cyclists along the way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries, according to the notice of intent to request the death penalty presented in the southern district of New York.
Both offences could result in a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a grand federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-pound indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of mafia, in addition to a crime of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's behavior as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Segon<0xC3><0xAD>n Damian Pagnon.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the southern district of New York brought to trial a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be deployed to his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 offences.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Put In Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own parliament members suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Ms. May faces when it comes to reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives in favor of the union have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is fighting to keep her Chequers’ commitment plan between the Brexit supporters, the EU and the EU.
The allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and push Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave de Solihull meeting that he wanted to break Chequers’ commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out,” he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must break the Chequers commitment."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed their mindset and wants to stay there is totally false."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I just tell you, Prime Minister, to listen to the people.”
Chequers’ commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win some elections.
Leave Chequers' commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said the politicians at the meeting must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the people of this country who gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom,” he said.
Meanwhile, union supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners over conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus deal, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to consider the possibility of running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is coming forward for his re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been a center of speculation about the possibility of relinquishing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the format of open meeting since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our government that is not working, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for the shooting of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police on Saturday announced that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the filming man.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in the head that eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into custody in the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after the team's orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing earlier and let Hamilton run with traffic on the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in boxing and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-by-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third runner.
Max Verstappen started at the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap went in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race, as he retained his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move to fourth position.
He eventually entered the boxing lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace to the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team did a fantastic job of having a U-dos," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate proved that people are "painful, cruel and lying."
“One thing that could happen and the most beautiful of what’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry, evil, cruel and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the announcements and leaks and they say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "Eh, what?
No, no, no, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn’t filter it,” he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me to do.”
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night meeting: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don’t care who they do evil, who they have to stumble to have power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's loss to the Elites against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return game 5-3 at Dundee Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-goal lead thanks to the draws of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but, after that, Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee. After that, two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan repositioned the home team in the game in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
A pilot dies to save hundreds of passengers from a plane from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake rocked Celebs Island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are taking place in the area and there are many people trapped among the runes in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his place at the tremorous control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik 6321 flight, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He later died in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that have not been accessed,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, with an altitude of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and rescues.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimarkets have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against the clock to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini Says Now That A Man Disappeared After Accident in Lake
The airline operating a flight that was going to crash in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although it previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not found a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane loved the lagoon because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe that the plane crossed the runway too high.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the waist to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who had been working nearby to improve a pier also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
Analyst composes a chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to build the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he had lied because his van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers about two weeks before he died.
The phone records indicated that it was only a week before they met.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense plans to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would pass to the jury for the same day.
The High Breed: What Is Hip-Hop Conscious?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative vision of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has strayed from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put hip-hop awareness back in fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another black person?!
Mainadera of NY demands a couple for commuting after a "racist" message
A New York midwife has denounced a couple for discriminatory reception after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother protesting that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed dismay at seeing the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived to work the first day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her peephole, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman accompanies Mrs. Maurice, stating that the maid she had accompanied, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice demands compensation from the couple for acquittal and demands compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month residency job for which she was hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do things like that," he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist while claiming that Maurice's acceptance was the most reasonable, as they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been groping with, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an "extortion," said his wife had two months to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Do you want to pursue something like that?
It’s not a very kind attitude,” the investor added.
The legal case has not yet been resolved and the court of public opinion has hastened to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and their logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's place that I read it for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small plush bone, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "aggressive", after his death.
He described Paddington as a very important member of his family and learned that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
“He was a discreet man; he wasn’t a presumptuous man,” he said.
“But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you pride yourself, even if it’s not your thing.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington’s own merit.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked on it to save her life.
"Nad often called to say it was very bad and they didn't expect me to get over it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“I got a call from Nad and he told me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll go with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications they had given him to keep his body beating were being consumed and were coming out of his system.
He had died earlier than he had planned, and so everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to stay in good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracting from the experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“He had his head on his neck and his tears didn’t stop falling.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad clapping.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her very much.”
Women of mourning want cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, was killed.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, with residency in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room.
However, he quit his job before dying because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after his own life had been taken away.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly concerned that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can go to, that you can listen to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
“He never said he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in attitude.
He played hard on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death meant a great trauma for them, but that they had to work it out: "Open a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is haunted by a thread as the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a scope and a limited time), we could get some unity," Mr Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the root cause of the supporters' deaths.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are left for the midterm elections of November 6. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in getting the man they want elected to go out to reach the main court of the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI comes up with your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to dismiss the post and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters "cau" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said that 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tight border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of deserters in the North are offered South Korean nationality.
Seoul sources say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is “hysterical” and is not fit to work in the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and that her temperament is incapacitating her to work for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have told her she's a 'hysterical'," Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes yelling and left speechless while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him were a "gross and coordinated murder of a character" organized by the angry Liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not work for the High Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to contest Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“This is what I can say: if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you’re not only not capable of being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge in the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would annul certain decisions of the High Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and hope that it looks wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to exercise their power.
It is a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant anger and you can’t take it away without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. And you?"
She went on... “I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, saying to the person she was talking to, “Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m ploppy.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
It seemed brilliant to me.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a masculine majority, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a little bit) who grabbed me from the neck and threw it at me.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad, because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Colorado Democratic MP at the time, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running herself as a presidential candidate.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As she arrived late in the campaign, she was late with the fundraising, so she promised she would not be able to enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, were only willing to give her 250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thank you for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for orienting herself to voters, instead of doing it to delegates, and anger, and sex).
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction.
“I could have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what will they put in my grave?
"Would you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial bailouts from the trade war between the US and China were staggering and, although it does not appear that the war should end soon, a distance between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new arrangements affecting $200 billion worth of products. These arrangements entail a taxation on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has counterattacked each time in the same way and has recently raised its five to ten percent stakes for $60 billion in American goods.
China has pledged to replicate the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to back down anytime soon.
Making Washington back means giving up in the face of some demands, but leaning publicly in front of the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centric research associate at the Center for New American Security.
Syria Is 'Prepared' for Refugees to Return, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a more than seven-year war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists demolished to restore normality.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or the aid of the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive European titles and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the lead in the water by 3-16, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his series and became one of the four players who have achieved the 5-0-0 since starting the current format of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was dismissed with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen, of Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 race points.
“I don’t want to cry, but I can’t help it today.
It has been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important ... and I am happy to have been able to help,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
A statistic oddity for one of the best players ever, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a time when we pushed the European selection.
We're fighting.
I take off my hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
He's got to take his hat off.
He's been defeated."
Red tide update: concentrations are reduced to Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

The red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Mean concentrations on the coast or away from the coast have been reported in Pinellas County over the past week, concentrations of lows at highs at a distance from the coast in Hillsborough County, concentrations of funds or highs as lows in Manatee County, concentrations of funds at mid-costs in Manatee County, and concentrations of funds at mid-costs in Chartone County.
Respiratory irritations continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported over the past week in northeastern Florida.
