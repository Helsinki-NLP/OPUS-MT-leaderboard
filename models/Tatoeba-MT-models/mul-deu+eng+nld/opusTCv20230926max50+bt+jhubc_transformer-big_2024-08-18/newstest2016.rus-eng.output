The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes envisage the preservation of the travel allowance in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the order of the organization of preferential passage of citizens using the social map of the inhabitants of the Ivanov region has changed.
According to the press service of the Government of Russia on the Ivanovsk region, the changes provide for the preservation of the travel allowance in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual calculations on the social map in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 of the FZ "On National Payment System".
At the same time, the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application are changed.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in travel as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - not more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the social card on the receipts issued in the transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the rest of the cash.
The cost of a preferential pass for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff in effect with the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of refilling the social card with cash remains the same – in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of passage on the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the spending of money on a social card with accuracy to the copeek.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning deposited but unused funds.
We also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed by the carrier budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing money on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road Economy and Transport of the Ivanovo Region, said that in 2014 there were more than 33 million trips in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
More than 470 million rubles are provided in the regional budget for granting preferential travel to citizens using a social card.
As of 1 September, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to the murder of a friend.
During the 911 call, Shannon Lamb, a professor at the university, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that employees were needed to come to their home.
Lamb emphasized that there is a “dog” in the house that lives, but is probably upset, and said the contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note, hand-written carelessly on a white sheet of lining paper: "I'm very sorry, I would like to bring it all back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me.
There was no indication that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the State University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, was able to travel 300 miles to the university campus, where, according to the police, he shot a respected prefect at the time.
The head of the Delta State University police, Lynn Bafford, said the university’s staff learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call to 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will have one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, authorities were still trying to put into one picture the motifs that provoked Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to make a portrait of a talented but perhaps worried teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gothenburg, where Prentiss died, said he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed his gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he crossed paths in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 professors, and many students attended lectures of one and the other.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who was well-reviewed about Lamb, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 academic year about how he struggled with stress.
Earlier, Lamb had asked the State University of Delta to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university admissions rules meant that the degree of a doctor, which Lamb worked so hard, would not guarantee him the automatic admission to the position of professor.
University President William Laforge said he did not know anything about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
Police attacked Lamb after his escape from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was shot from a 38-caliber revolver in the backyard of a house, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car with a working engine was still standing on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate of pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Hearston said she was 15 and Lambou was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls were hiding when he was around," says Harriston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had been together for some time at the time of the events.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothia in a brick house, the other side of which goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Sean O’Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
“She’s completely depressed,” O’Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
They played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-coordinator of entertainment programs at The Julep Room in the Gotier suburb, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lip harmonica.
There was nothing suspicious about it.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We had fun and laughed at each other.
I mean, they were both very smart.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, conducted seminars for first-timers and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America,” said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
At the University of Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students, and community members, took part in a memorial candlelight ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis has passed.
Today is a day of recovery.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was prepared by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamba's call came to 911 after Schmidt's murder, as well as in connection with the fact that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when she called 911, information that they did not hold in.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with a toy and children’s goods retailer reassuring that it will allow full-time staff and temporary staff to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 that were hired for the holiday season of 2014.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing the applicants this month and will increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although before the holidays a few more months, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff in order to have enough staff in stores and on the sale, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "dating" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons as well.
"We were sitting in the cinema and waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me is free, and here I fall - next to me will be Princess Diana," he said in the trailer.
The film begins, and here I come to think that I am literally at a distance with my hand stretched out and in one fake zewk from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back in the Future that includes interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The film “Back to the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
“For me,” Spielberg says, “it’s arguably the greatest film about time travel that’s ever been filmed.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in response to Russia’s military support for Syria that there is no “military solution” for the nearly five-year conflict, and that the increase in arms would only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief once again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gui Moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month.
He regretted that disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, “made the situation insoluble.”
Mr. Gui Moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated when addressing the issue of the nuclear program on Iran, and when considering the Syrian crisis.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Is Not Joking
Some tried to put on him the label of a provocateur.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
Some of them require a scandal.
But as much as some Republicans are trying to question Donald Trump’s high position in the poll results, they haven’t (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated Donald Trump’s advantage in two-digit numbers, and some are beginning to seriously question what this means for a real estate magnate in terms of chances of getting a nomination.
This is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that during this time in 2011, Rick Perry surrendered his superior gaining popularity to Herman Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But external groups, such as the Jeb Bush Political Supercommittee, and the conservative economic group Growth Club, recognize Trump’s unwavering power and begin to get their dollars to smash him.
Here are some survey figures that say that a real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
The sympathy ratings for Trump have expanded by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude toward the real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump at the moment.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators get to the top in the initial stages.
A poll by Quinnipiac in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of the people who voted for the GOP would appoint Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either behave “enjoyed” or “satisfied” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “disturbed” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “excited” against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be “dissatisfied” or “disturbed” if the establishment’s favorite, Jeb Bush, becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticised for his arrogance and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters across the country think the magnate has the right temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington post poll showed.
The same figure appears in the country’s first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be the commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he is not the person who can be effective in the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put their hats on by experts, Republican voters think that Trump is serious about it.
Asked who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn’t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign to be compelling.
Even if the Republicans were to unite around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a spread is likely to play Trump’s advantage, and at the same time non-Trump supporters are evenly distributed among those supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of a majority.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorino by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Casey and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got no one with Ted Cruz.
Is he the only candidate around?
Ben Carson beat businessmen by as many as 19 points in the hypothetical one-on-one competition.
More than half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters in favor of Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never changes his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with fellow outside neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration, according to the report.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" two months ago in his speech opening the campaign, the theme of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s reluctance will deter key voters of Latin American descent from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to Monday’s ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration attracts public attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday said in a new ABC/Post poll that they wanted a political outsider rather than a person with government experience.
And they are also offended by Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey, conducted two weeks ago in Iowa, shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are disappointed with Republican congressional activity, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "dissatisfied".
The government will decide the fate of pension indexes in October.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodez said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 at a real level of inflation.
She noted that the decision should be made by October 8, when the draft budget for the following year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the cabinet is discussing the option of prolongation of the decision on the freezing of the cumulative pension of Russians.
Golodez noted that the amount of pension accumulations is 350 billion rubles.
That’s about as much as the full pension index for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
Goldetz believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the eyelids often irritated and red?
The ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashova answers:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eye’s apple from the many tiny particles that lie on it.
By forgetting the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The way out is simple:
do not trim your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet napkin for the eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from the accumulated harmful substances in them for a day.
Cleansing procedures should not be supplemented with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (salves, chamomile), which dilute the thick secret of saliva, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out by circular movements of the pillows of the fingers;
Washing makeup, do not use alcoholic remedies.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of the secret of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that the Korean nuclear weapons have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities said that the country’s main nuclear reactor, the Yonbe nuclear complex, is operating “at full capacity.”
The report appeared on the website of the country’s Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and in quality”.
The last test of nuclear weapons was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims he was able to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly conducted tests of medium and small-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove the mention of fraternal peoples from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
This he said during the meeting of the State Duma, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
“A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can’t stand it,” Zhirinovsky said.
The MP believes that it is necessary to remove all the quadrilaterals in which this line is contained:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God, the Tsar of Guards", and the Russian tricolor replaced by the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
It is not a question of whether or not Europe accepts refugees, but of the need to address the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our opinion on this issue.
“That’s the issue of refugees,” he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues and people do not feel completely safe.
“This way, we can reach a consensus, but we can’t do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
We will remind that about 500,000 migrants have arrived in the countries of the European Union this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is not excluded that thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic State” may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation in order to create their own cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently stepped up border controls to curb their influx.
Authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call the figures significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents are very warmly welcomed by migrants.
Jeremy Corbyn Debuts at the Prime Minister’s Questions Session
Following the election of Mr. Corbyn, his debut at the Prime Minister’s Questions Session is eagerly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will be speaking for the first time at the Prime Minister’s Questions Session, the first time he has met with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues raised in the second half of the day; his speech is likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theater and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some of the meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test as a leader; it will take place after his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent during the national anthem’s performance on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, has sparked criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and has become the subject of several prominent newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Corbyn’s spokesman said he was “standing in a respectful silence” and acknowledged “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.”
However, a member of Corbyn Owen Smith’s shadow cabinet told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbyn’s team, voiced disagreements on issues of economy, defense and international policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political disagreements will also “slow down” in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment to a post in the European Union and government restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at the Trade Unions Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister for labour and pensions, said that the party had "full clarity" on the fact that it was in opposition only to the government's plans to reduce the upper limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the “courier box” for the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who had promised a different approach to politics, said he had “attracted collective resources” to get ideas from Mr. Cameron’s questions and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Aylington North County said the Prime Minister’s questions caused an unnecessary confrontation and that he would refrain from clever answers and exchanges of quantities, instead promising to focus on the issues of youth, and not poverty.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on the Prime Minister ' s questions when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak whenever possible, saying that he had approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the matter.
Having become the leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of the "marriage ballad", often associated with the Prime Minister's question procedure, but admitted several years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has turned into a cartoon and requires large-scale reforms.
"Images in Yoburg" Homeless young people learned from photographers
Johannesburg’s business center is a difficult place for the homeless.
But a group of former impostors found a way to master the craft and make a living.
“I was filmed in Yoburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the neighborhood and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

The Pound Sterling Rises as Wages Rise in the UK
The pound rose against the backdrop of wage growth in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to an offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009, and has been seen as a transfer to an earlier period of forecasts for possible quotation growth.
The pound sterling increased by more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to $1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In the background, SABMiller shares were allotted, which grew by 20% thanks to the purchase offer received from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world’s two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% against the backdrop of promising news from a competing group of luxury goods manufacturers Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales data exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China – in the key market for Burberry – began to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it was able to earn $2.5 billion by placing shares, which was done as part of a debt-cutting strategy.
The shares of the paper and packaging group Mondi were leaders in the fall in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
Shares of JD Sports rose after the company, the supplier of sportswear, reported an 83 percent increase in earnings before tax in the six-month period to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports Chief Says Higher Salaries May Impede Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Caugill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of labor, he says.
Expenses could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches bottom-up initiative campaign to fight Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier on the initiative below has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the impending $700 million infusion by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local grocery retailers and promoting the IGA brand by means of so-marketing in-vegetation.
The campaign is joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as ice cream maker Simmo's from Dansboro, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to regular customers for South African Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29, the day when this wholesale supplier of food, beverages and household goods will be holding its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot on the horse, as in South Australia and Western Australia, stores under the IGA brand account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of customary routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, which is close to the Southwest, with more than 30 percent in the Southwest and 24 percent in the Westwest.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will snatch 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking the sales volume from all the players present, but mainly from independent games.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash - $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in those markets respectively.
Losses of revenue and volumes of food sales at a high level of constant expenses Metcash could cost the company about 13 million revenues before paying interest and taxes, says Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this is while a recent Morgan Survey study found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash food sales will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, chief stock manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted to those present at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash “is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But a member of Metcash’s board of directors was supposed to have contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share declined from 18 percent to 14 percent in 2010, and Metcash’s food business revenues, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell 43 percent from sales in 2012 due to operational deletion and depreciation.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths for a thousand positions per week and helping retailers IGA outfit larger retailers in the product reorganization of larger retail sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price alignment and redevelopment of trading venues are gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve net profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis endorses Tennis Australia President Steve Hill
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves praise, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kirios and deserves more credit for his behavior than critics, says Tennis Australia President Steve Hill.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often referred to as the "Special Ks", was involuntarily in the spotlight due to Cyrus' embarrassing clash with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualifying match at Cincinnati, the judge on the tower had to distinguish Kokkinakis twice from his opponent Ryan Harrison, with Harrison stating: "The fairy had to lay on the shoulders of Cyrus, and I had to lay on the shoulders of this guy."
C Since Cockinaxis was last seen breaking the racket after a crash in his leg saved Richar Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly is loyally defending Cockinaxis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second after Bernard Tomich in the singles final of the Davis Cup against Great Britain.
“I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely that Tanasi was involved in the conflict,” Hilly said.
He really broke the racquet when he kicked his leg at the US Open, but he wasn’t the first player to break the racquet when the hopes broke, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at provocative situations in the U.S., with Harrison, and so on, and I'm sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, he fits well in the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he is intensely trained, he is in excellent shape, he is a very targeted and developed young man and I think he will appreciate it.
Hille also supported the decision to forgive Cyrus for an important match starting on Friday, citing "reciprocal agreement" as the right outcome for everyone, but expecting the Canberra guy to return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on the disputes around [Kirjos],” Hilly said.
And I think that Nick has gained strength very quickly, what people like Federer and Murray prove, he's grown in the public eye, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the best criticism he gets for the best time, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants
In announcing a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those attempting to enter the country illegally in order to restrain the flow of migrants.
On the border there were riots - hundreds of migrants gathered on the border territory, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
After being stuck indefinitely on a section of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence at home broke down tents and settled in the area.
However, dissatisfaction increased.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special-purpose police.
In protest, some of them refused food and water.
Serbia’s foreign minister has declared the “unacceptable” expulsion of migrants back from Hungary as more and more migrants arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the associated damage.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to take joint responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking asylum in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) the Vetch will reach an agreement of 120,000 people, according to which the member states of the European Union do not agree.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency EU summit to be convened next week to discuss the immigration crisis that spanned the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect immediate action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The declared state of emergency in the two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities more powers to act in the face of the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum litigation.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Peter Sijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence on a section of the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dugata reported that even the inmates were connected to urgent work to complete the pick-up from the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main "narrow spot" and crossing point of the EU's border for migrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees, who are the victims of the EU’s other acts of war, which have the right to protection, and this point of view is foreign.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer tussles.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," Zoltan Kovac, a government spokesman in the southern city of Szeged, told reporters.
We make it clear that illegal border crossings are a crime.
Formally, the parliament is still to sanction the deployment of military forces, as expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters who are on the border have been watching the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
Jerome Bakondi, Orban’s national security adviser, said the authorities had arrested 45 people attempting to cross the border at the border and 15 others inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the Serbian border on Tuesday morning, forcing a railroad wagon wrapped in a barbed wire to block one of the passages.
Disturbances erupted at the main border crossing near the city of R<0xC3><0xB3>zske (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed a service room to pass people inside the metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break in.
About 20 people were able to penetrate the interior, while thousands of people were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced a ban on food and water until they were passed to Hungary.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to retain a double-digit advantage in the Democratic nomination race across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders succeeds her.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary Democrats (down from 58 percent) and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to take part in the presidential race, receives support from 15 percent of primary Democrats.
More than five months before the start of the primary election competition, a majority of Democrats say it’s too early to say they’ve decided on the candidate they’ll support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choice than they are in favor of other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support from some demographic groups, and Sanders has earned some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has diminished.
Her support among the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democrats before the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders by a double-digit number among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
Nearly half of the primary Democratic voters across the country say they would have enthusiastically supported Clinton if she had become a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may come as no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at her expense.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of primary Democrats say they would have enthusiastically supported Clinton, fewer Republicans say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question about why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 percent), then that she is now a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for that position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also speak of an association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 percent) as well.
It is also called consensus on issues and chances of election.
As the vice president is considering potential participation in the election, 57 percent of primary Democrats would like him to join the race — although a third believe he is not following.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party’s candidates, the primary Democratic voters are in most cases called Biden.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the contestants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure dropped from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden is far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question of what is most important in a candidate, Democrats choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people who have good leadership qualities. . . .
Biden out of all three leads in honesty, and Clinton’s strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary Democrats do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a specific opinion on him at that point.
The primary Democrats also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be similar.
According to all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal mailbox and server continue to be raised by her secretary of state, most primary Democrats are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and believe that it did not adversely affect their general opinion.
But this is a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after this story became known.
The majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers her party’s voters to be honest and trustworthy, it remains a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her to be honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month’s.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it to be fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, are both getting good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush showed the best result in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest person rather than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey, Ben Carson closely approached Donald Trump.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in his latest CBS/New York Times poll.
The two candidates garnered half of the vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of support.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate has increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll on the eve of Fox News debates last month to 27% in a poll on Tuesday.
But Carson took off for the same period by 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, pushing Trump into a group of Republicans with a higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Cassich, turned back along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus-minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll, published last week, showed Carson’s growth in polls — showing 19 percent support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32 percent support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
Due to the rise in Carson’s support last week, Trump made several critical cases against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of first-year Baruch college student
About two years after the death of a college student during a rite of brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the murder charge was brought against five people.
“Members of the P. Delta P.S. Brotherhood of New York Baruch College brutally attacked Chan “Michael” Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not deliver him to the hospital on time, which resulted in his death,” the police said.
Officials say a student with his eyes tied up and a 30-pound backpack with sand on his back pressed several times as he tried to reach the goal by walking on a sliding surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the P. Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and were supposedly waiting another hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
They, however, found time to change Deng’s clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood’s national president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide private property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above Michael Deng’s health,” Wagner said.
They couldn't save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the report of the discovery, Deng suffered several dumb injuries to his head, hips and thighs.
“Too many families have suffered from fraternity rituals as at least one student dies during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Feuerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must bear responsibility, and this step on the part of the authorities is very important.
Jury counties in Monroe have leaned in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence against the newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to hold not only individual participants accountable, but if there is an organization that sanctioned all of this formally or unofficially, then so does it,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What will happen if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will collide, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will continue.
Specifically for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for 86 months.
The stiffness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the U.S. Central Bank insists that investors should not focus on when it will start raising bets, but on how long the adjustment will take.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the futility around raising bets turns out to be exaggerated.
“The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” said Julian Jessop, chief customer of the international economy at Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the US to a more normal but still low level will be a seismic momentum that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy may have reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, the expectation of rising rates can lead to instability for some time.
When the rate is increased, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It doesn’t seem like stock income will slow for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike.
If more specifically, the market in the past about 35 years has changed more often Barron Management - about 14 per cent - in the direction of raising the rates, remains fairly flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, after the annoyance of the annoyance, the annoyance of the annoyance, the annoyance of the annoy, returns to the normal state of the 14 with the average yield.
According to Deutsche, the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising interest rates, and earnings from stocks are starting to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but increases in rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that have not existed before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point during the entire existence of the elevated rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it’s long, with the third quarter keeping it at only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Increasing rates against such a volatile economic background can be risky and raises the question “will it be different this time,” Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, while their view is tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could have approved the rate hike at this meeting, futures trading is only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all of the rate hike cycles up to the present day were in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage for GDP, overlapping peaks pre-recession, very quickly after the beginning of recovery,” the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period chosen.
The current cycle at the moment is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it has only lasted 74 months and is not yet over.
Fixed income has also become volatile as the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is being implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will come faster than for stocks, when the Federal system changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first rate increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, the yield of bonds immediately drops,” reports Deutsche.
Strategists from Charles Schwab believe that rising rates will lead to long-term and short-term bond yields approaching, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of fluctuations in yields,” said Katie Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal system policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has aligned with the prospect of a tougher monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, yield curves are flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market as the Federal system tightens policy.
In general, companies running their main business in the U.S. will benefit from raising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will find themselves in a worse situation, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt more expensive - in the financial.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks demonstrate higher performance than the market within three months of the initial rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Firms with stable financial standing bypassed firms with unstable standing as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004, averaging 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as shares with low volatility, also showed better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average by 4 (interest points) and 3 (interest points) respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
Companies with a high rate of debt with a floating rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher yields, although experts differ in how quickly this will happen.
“BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM,” says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the station for “declining standards”
It proves that it is becoming less and less distinct from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just a match with the Brits.
Parliamentary Colleague Damien Collins, who ran into The Voice with the same criticism, was not the original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," the MPs' leader said, prompting the broadcaster to prove that it is doing at least something that commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC management that it seems that the public radio station is "stupid" and becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'simplification' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted for the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else, here are two examples that come to my mind that you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC’s director-general has denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I’m learning thanks to Radio 3, I’m not learning about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and the creation of music will not really be compared to anyone else.
“It’s also really very important, I think, for Radio 3’s interest in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davie claimed that radio stations have to work much more to attract an audience than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to have been attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of parliament from Tory Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent show that the BBC purchased from the Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
See why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Fate and Boy George are judges, was made in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit in its own home stable” the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Online sales growth slowed as much as possible in August, and Black Friday may be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by seven per cent.
Last month, it was the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could have contributed to deterrence of spending
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been experiencing a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of a levelling of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August has shown minimal growth since they began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by just five per cent.
Experts say there have now been signs of easing online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the pace of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Malkehe, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people had the opportunity to shop online and that they could do it in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming out on the plateau, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could have refrained from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers were five times more likely to rush to computers on average to take advantage of profitable offers, breaking down a number of vendors’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers engage in a real battle for lucrative purchases, could have made people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 in every 5 is spent online.
As far as products such as TVs and washing machines are concerned, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willing than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims Protect Those Killed in Crane Falls in Mecca, and Ben Laden's Family Is Sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets as first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed for the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed in the crash of a crane at Mecca's main mosque.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funerals filled the passage to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed past the sacred place, where only a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the hallways.
The bodies were handed over for burial, and at the same time the King of Saudi Arabia fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners killed in the crash of a crane in the Main Mosque, carried on the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Casim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to come to the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the crane raised when the crane was not working.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state agency Saudi Press, says that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English news agency did not tell about this detail, but said that the company's leaders were banned from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the crash in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improperly aligning the actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
For decades, the bin Laden family has been part of Saudi Arabia’s close-knit ruling family and is leading major construction projects.
The late leader of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a son-in-law who the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in their lives for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said there were 158 people in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million riyals (about <0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to relatives of the deceased, and the same amount irreversibly crippled.
The other victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q argues that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing.
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country.
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is said that the British put aside hammers and paintbrushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or skillfully paint the walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the company owner B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialists to do easy work at home.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home furnishing services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in master goods, and at the same time close 60 B&Q warehouses.
Ms. Lori said she would like to see more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shop decisions are made by low-sex representatives.
At present, the majority of the staff are men.
According to her, the latest demographic trends, which are characterised by the growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past, cannot be ignored.
Ms. Lori said: “In our stores, there are still mostly men working.
Steps need to be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decisions made about the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori, one of five women in charge of leading UK companies, whose shares are listed in the FTSE100 index, has also changed the composition of the top management team, reaching among the directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including a CEO and a chief financial officer.
Ms. Lori said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women on the board of directors was easy.
After the group took over the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales volumes over the six-month period.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the brands Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores
Time to decide on the interest rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank, where the two-day debate on whether or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade is taking place.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who still believed last week that the Federal Reserve would go for it now believe that it would still time and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working effectively, economic growth adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for changes, but it all speaks of their confidence that all chances are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open up!" are chanting hundreds of refugees at the checkpoint Khorgoz on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to hear other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, is through Romania.
The other, through Croatia and Slovenia, goes to Austria.
According to some data, buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovich assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people and ensure a humane attitude towards them.
But this is already a common European problem.
Solving it is not easy, no country in Europe alone will cope with it, and even more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is unwavering:
If someone is called a refugee, they must fill in the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he does not, he will not be allowed into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meymarakis: "Europe wants to help us".
Vangelis Meymarakis has been a member of right-centered governments for a number of years, leading, in the opinion of the left, the country to a financial crisis.
Now he has become the interim leader of the New Democracy party and is challenging Cyprus.
A few days before the election, he met with the journalist Euronius.
Euronius: Mr. Meymarakis, welcome to Euronius!
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat by relinquishing to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, “New Democracy” has been compared to it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a surplus of budget and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors are gone because Mr. Tsipras has chased them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Cypriot.
And now they can easily compare what is promised to what has actually happened.
Everyday life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation has improved, and this has affected the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronius: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZ.
Vangelis Meymarakis: The thing is, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes were or are still in operation, the political forces and all the ruling parties gathered together to implement the programme under which they had reached agreement, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you abide by this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece’s move on the European path, because we have a good idea of what the devastating consequences would be for the country’s exit from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in the first year in power wants to bring order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the program of salvation, then, I am sure, the resonance with the resonance with the resonance of the resonance can be.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the agreement to be fully implemented.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to take advantage of the benefits of EU funding and the greater investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Cypriot Government did not make any serious arguments on many of the key political issues that we found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers’ income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Cyprus had never spoken about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronius: If you win the election, you will soon be at a table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we were trying to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We are moving forward with reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price set by the Greek government.
I was the speaker of the parliament at the time, I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which at the time constituted a governmental majority.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements over the key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and that was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process were not interrupted by the early general elections that were the result of the December presidential elections.
Euronius: In recent weeks there has been a massive influx of refugees across Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of the European countries that these people aspire to?
Vangelis Meymarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-acting bomb that we have to deal with after the election victory.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, you should act in advance, because if the problem overtakes you, then only emergency measures remain.
And we're in this situation right now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZ did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, to which the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, provides valuable assistance, will enable a solution to be found.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian dimension, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must also be involved.
We also need better coordination of action, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronius: Mr. Meymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you.

The man who opened the shooting at the State University of Delta left a note with an apology
After shooting and murdering his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day – Shannon Lamb wrote a note in which he said the body was “sorry” about the first murder and would like to believe it.
Police in the city of Gothenburg, Mississippi, reported that a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police should send people to his home.
He reported, "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there is a "dog" in the house that "doesn't touch anyone" but is probably upset.
The police questioned the name of the caller, but he did not call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shot.
Upon arriving at the crime scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which read: “I’m sorry I’d like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who's ever loved me.
Writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when surrounded by police, he killed himself.
William Laforge, the university's rector, said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite information coming on Monday that Lamb had suggested a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported the “lack of any information or evidence” of the “love triangle.”
Prentiss was referred to as "a good man" by Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss have a daughter, 19, and that she's "uncomfortable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the San Gerald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home over the internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Wells said, "She's always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb called relatives on Monday at some point to say that “he will not go to jail.”
In the evening of the same day, when the police found him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, Lamb received a Ph.D. in pedagogy from the State University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Luck
The actor (left), photographed with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his lifelong companion, Farru Fassett, who died of cancer.
The actor is reported to have also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for storing drugs.
All of this, of course, played a role.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been suspended for several months due to a double break.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about the reason why he will not be able to go out on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gale hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno’s ruthless 15-minute pounding when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty area.
He was assisted on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gale said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported to Manchester tomorrow or a day later and then pro-operated.
"It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame a lot of difficulties and started playing fantastically, and that's where it happened.
He had an oxygen mask in his locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not given a penalty.
Arbitrator Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Rizzoli did not punish Mexicans.
Van Gale believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a very bad two-legged podcast.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you to everyone for your messages, not to describe in words how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United suffers misfortune with Luke Shaw after losing to PSV
The defender will have an additional incentive to make it to the European Championships in France next June.
"Philip Coku, the PSV coach, said: 'It's a very serious injury.'
When any player gets out with such an injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the enemy.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gale at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him now because he had no intention of hurting the enemy, and when you hear that it’s a very serious injury, you feel bad,” Koku said.
I had no chance to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) was touching it, but I didn’t see the podcast under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear.
I'm very sad, and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
Every parent very quickly learns one thing: if your child liked any book, it will take a while before you get to know it almost indistinctly.
Probably, unless you're David Cameron.
Answering the question of the representative of the company, which is engaged in the organization of children's vacations, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairytale with an environmental deflection, written by Dr. Suz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment posted on SuperCamps’ website, and continues: “This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children, because there is always a snippet in it.”
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the film of the same name, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added in order to diversify quite a bit.
"In 1991, surrounded by the high walls of the town of Temnuzhville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dream.
If this seems unsuspecting enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a brief exposition of the plot of the film "Lorax", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the town of Odvodn<0xC3><0xAD>k - Odvodn<0xC3><0xAD>k - Odvodn<0xC3><0xAD>k - Odvodn<0xC3><0xAD> - Odvodn<0xC3><0xAD> - Odn<0xC3><0xAD>dn<0xC3><0xAD> - Odn<0xC3><0xAD> - Odn<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3>
It seems unlikely that, as Cameron is generally acknowledged to be an active parent, he is so ignorant of the contents of the book that the unnamed boy learns about how to destroy the environment by a greedy tree cutter and a bandage.
Most likely, such a simple PR task has been entrusted to the performer, who has never read a child’s book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments followed.
For Adam Litt there was obviously a risk of not joining the England team, but it is still a difficult question.
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the team that England has selected for this tour, repeating the defeat in the test series with a 3-0 count that happened last time, I don’t think it’s likely.
I wouldn't rule out winning on my field either.
Alistair Cook’s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it includes players who virtuosoly accept ball-turned and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring 2012 scars, but only youth positives.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving rounded balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Litt is out of England on Test Cricket and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Litt, his head coach at Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyze.
In his seven test matches, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricketers are judged by the judges on the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said that before) players choose themselves best.
The couple were half-hundred, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he scores more for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bailiss, was good at his mood, even when he didn’t show what he was capable of, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the batsman of the test cricket will leave an impression - a difficult question.
Litt played in seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton played in nine.
Only Compton was given a chance to play on his own and on another field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League, when Litt was in the best shape, but that missed opportunity was in the past.
There's Alex Hales, and he's a batsman that I highly value.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club earlier this season when he won 236 in a game against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the team’s composition in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moan next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would give an opportunity to introduce an additional spinner, while retaining four speed bowlers, is being considered, and I’m not at all against that.
I don’t see any reason why a batting player can’t throw the ball there, and this left has already shown that he’s a damn good cricketer.
Moan may not be exactly what is needed for his county of Worcestershire, but it has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a "third batsman" before coming out as an opening pitcher in 2001.
He immediately won three hundred and did not look.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a backup spinner, and during my brief communication with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate stats – an average of 31 with a beat and 35 with a ball – and think it’s a risky bet, but among the spinners who vote “for” a little, and the pickers chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauwordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a masterpiece.
He is one of the best guys to play, which will bring in the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and merciless pace in the set.
I’ve always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has already been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Collie's teammate, Darem Ben Stokes, has been left for one day, Ruth has been given a similar break for Australia, and I, for example, am not having any problems with that.
While not everyone will agree, coaches and players selecting players do not set a timetable.
And you have to remember how the players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The camp of supporters of Britain’s exit from the European Union could win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron’s unthinking policy of resuming negotiations on Britain’s survival in the EU is getting more and more difficult every day, even without considering the choice of genius Jeremy – “Is it yes or no?” – Corbyn is the Labour leader or the TUC’s resentment about Europe.
Aliens also have their own Corbina and Nigela Faraggio.
The friendly European diplomat explained in recent days that in the situation in which the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them of its own manufacture - some of the countries-participants who are fed up with those who are not in the throats of the British egocentric agenda and grow up.
Gathering in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided he didn’t want them in any case if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie program.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance ride on summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a famous local monument, in the company of local celebrity or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain to have external contacts under the auspices of the European Union – “Don’t leave us with France,” says Berlin – is suggesting that the undercover ministers or officials in some of the capitals should come to us when they arrive.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before things get worse for her, as she deteriorates for those who sit in her seat at Tatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kolya (16).
French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power too.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to see them slipping out of the skin to help the selfies, whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK — which they don’t want either, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue intentionally useless SNP-style remarks during a referendum campaign in the UK in 2017 to spur the process of Britain’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
“The review was an idea-fix” and “Britain received nothing valuable from the resumption of negotiations.”
The Europeans know at their behest what a predator Fleet Street may be, and how sceptical about the EU are the media magnets, unlike the times of Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which backed our entry in 1973 at a 2:1 ratio.
They may be confused with Boris Johnson, a rooted Euro-opportunist who was famous for his “direct EU bananas” from a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a vicious company of fearsome tax fraudsters, phone hackers-foreigners and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was of the exact same opinion about them, but he did realize that when you’re in a cell with a big gorilla, you have to give her a banana to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, as Blair acted on principles in favor of the repealed EU constitution, which was buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005.
The press did not forgive him any of this.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly kicked me in the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he had no more time to spend it on me — seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnock's 'boycott' strategy of the '80s.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I call evolution delicately.
He said he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the traditionalist Ukip trend and the wider circle of "Little England supporters" among the Tories may probably say yes to it.
It’s the same thing that Hillary — Benn, but not Bennett — said on radio and TV this week, with his domestic boyscout refusing to admit that Corbyn’s appointment as a shadowy finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old man-father fought with all his might on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the Labour Office, not going too far and not losing his post in the Cabinet.
The battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “under any circumstances”—Benn’s phrase—is not something McConnell said, and not something J.K. said to couples and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and his “boyfriend” Corbyn wanted to report there – remember, he touched even me – the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the waterfront of social media, the scourge of paranoia and betrayal.
It makes sense not to allow Cameron to be so easily separated from Europe, allowing him to accept the support of the Labour Party during the campaign to hold a referendum, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s main misconception about EU membership – within the “Bennite” economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by a minor difference, is a central principle in the EU.
As for his misconceptions about Nato — Tom Watson — there is no doubt that J.K. will not agitate for an exit — foreign diplomats will have to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why spend political capital in Paris or Berlin – they also have suspicious voters – on Britain’s concessions when all this can be meaningless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed by the weak British military actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government is cutting spending, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts Criticize Public Health England E-Cigarette Review
The agency’s government-funded statements that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were heard at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, the researchers reported.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) along with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE published an important report — a "turning wing" last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized "extremely shaky argument", on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers asked whether these statements had "firm or skewed grounds".
Martin McKee, a professor at the European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of health is the e-health.
According to them, the public expects that PHE’s statements that “the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking” were based on a detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is the result of a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multicriteria analysis of decision-making in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He has also confirmed BAT certificates in the field of health in the report on sustainable development.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette maker, not to mention the funding he reportedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of council members was not provided, but among them are several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of which have also stated about funding the industry in the publication.
It is not known if other participants of the meeting have management experience in the tobacco case.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco direction at PHE.
The scientific paper, published by the group, “extremely agrees” with the fact that there is a lack of “weak evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria,” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's statements that "at the moment there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, causing children or non-smokers to smoke" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ’s statements had been answered earlier.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence suggests that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the far-reaching consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what these evidences prove and do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
Clearly pointing out the obvious – that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only do some of the damage caused by smoking – we perform our tasks before the nation.
Previous Previous post: Former Channel 4 CEO Says BBC Should Stop EastEnders
Former Channel 4 chief Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop releasing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would have given much to such successful shows as the soap opera on Albert Square.
Johnson noted that the license fees should only be used to create such programs that are not released by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which probably only a small portion of the audience watch, at a peak time when competitors go to high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to work more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessfully trying to work with the BBC for six years while working on Channel 4.
“I cannot separate from the idea that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting broadcasts that could be shown by competing companies that do not receive subsidies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC’s investigation into the future fate.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should leave on the air only those programs that are not issued and are not going to be issued by other companies.
The Voice is coming to life in the prime slot because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to funding transmissions that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is commonly known that they are their own production.
There is no doubt that other channels would have given much to her.
I don’t know how this could be a public broadcaster.
I don’t think that would embarrass the BBC.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "for the ambitions of employees and for their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo the comments of Sky executive Tony Bolly, who in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh offered the BBC to sell EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more niche BBC public broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument with all of these" suffixes in Hanze sermons.
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
On the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot of money, I'm curious, they think so because they don't really look and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive director David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Rita’s mission in favor of “inform, educate and entertain.”
He noted that only a small part of the BBC's published material is now formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters.
On the issues of partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as the “Change Concerts” (only some of them, according to him, are shown on TV), as well as join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
Sonogenetics allows you to control brain cells by means of sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change the direction of movement when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have removed worms from a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Small nematodes change the direction of movement at the moment when they are affected by sound pulses that are too high for the human ear to hear them.
The pulses act by activating neurons that are genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Also on topic: Researchers manage brain activity with the help of light
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a research fellow at the Salca Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure for paralysis that is used to send electrical impulses into the human brain.
Nematodes usually don’t respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the body of worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, the sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into the organisms of worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that applied in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons by means of light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the required area of the brain via optoelectronic fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass unhindered through the tissues of the body, so for their delivery it is not necessary to pass inside the skull box.
“We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical conditions the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses could temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal,” Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Forbidden torture equipment - right at your doorstep!
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Advertisements smeared on UK arms trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International protesting against the arms exhibition.
Awesome killer drones!
Destroying iron candles!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise duvets that cause unbearable pain but leave no traces!
A sober voice and a drawn animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international exhibition of weapons is an edgy parody, prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the intention of the British government to bypass the systems and push the weapons into the repressive regimes.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains, which require to look at them again.
"An important announcement to go on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - written on one of them in the fonts of the London Underground with the image of the DLR line, turning into a silhouette of the tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be heated to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters were drawn by artists who exhibited their works at the Museum of Brutal Design in Banksy Park, Dismaland.
A group called Special Patrol helped spread them across London, using a “set of ad-blockers,” a 6-pound set of snail keys that is said to “give access to about a third of the advertising space on the planet’s bus stops.”
Transporters in London are not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the exhibition Cruel Designs and a professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and striving to bring political art to an audience outside of galleries.
Many artists start working with activists of the protest movement, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the weapons show, welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the pro bono VCCP agency, involving a graphic designer and voice artist who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the weapons show – with a pass in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s set them up a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought they would create more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but “filling her home with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting occupation.”
“They have been incredibly helpful in bringing our attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Tom Davis of Amnesty International.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the exhibition of weapons goes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about the order for the AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting, which came from the U.S. Army.
It includes “no analogue cumulative warhead that brings unparalleled booking action within the target.”
Whatever he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved to a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I’ve irritated – and the numerous, long complaints on others.
Basically, what I’ve learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can range from a slightly nerve-wracking to an absolutely scary one.
He encourages you to chat: to tell people where you came from, whether you took academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you are "honestly, I don't like, I don't hate "Marmite" because, seriously, I'm just, guys, it's just yeast extract.
Breathe in.
And help others to breathe too - ask questions and show interest.
It supports conversation and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn’t even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on, and they would give out fire extinguishers.
Give the people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas, and common lounge areas, but they’re also the place where people dress and repair underwear.
Also on topic: Don’t even think about starting a university study while in a relationship
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a haven, but many dormitories form a culture of hustle and bustle from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It could be hell for someone who is trying to restore their strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I spent on communicating with you.”
Try to feel when the fellow student is tired of communication - and not touch him, but send SMS.
By the way, about the punch: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed the following principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He's seen something.
Make friends with the help of baking.
Since you start university life at the peak of popularity of the Bake-Off show, then knocking on the door to people to introduce and present a plate of chocolate cookies, - it will no longer be such a strange action to you, and it does not look like 1950s to you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel compelled to talk to you, and in the end, your face will likely be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are a baker.
Badly glued pieces of flour, sugar, and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you hit them.
Theft of food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, assigning someone's chicken is theft, but is this theft - to take a little bit of milk for tea?
Go to the owner of the milk.
He'll probably offer you not to be shy, even if it boils in anger.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you - but try to treat this adult than my neighbor, who poured in her milk a dishwashing liquid to avenge those who took it without question.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the proverb about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked my neighbor to enhance the sound of drums and bass guitars, since it was 3 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he was finally silent at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, then slammed her music and locked the door behind her, going for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future husband lived in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, it wouldn’t be extremely, until the bite of the elbows, awkward, if you would accept the neighbor as your future spouse, be attracted to him, break the relationship and should see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull on his side of all your common friends.
Of course, you won’t mind – but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own dust a little.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the boundary between play and mischief is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never pack anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close someone else’s door and drop your keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer – but don’t glue someone else’s stuff with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on iPhone after the release of an update from Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, select General, and then select Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some encountered problems after the installation, when an error message appears telling them that "Application update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised either to wait until the revival is quiet, or to try to update it through iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include removing apps to increase free space — but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified execution with a special utility that offers to remove apps and reinstall them after the process is complete.
You should make sure that when you perform an update, your phone is charged or located next to the charger to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as charging the phone in the process may cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia’s military activity by phone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that further support from President Assad by Russia poses a risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict, and also negatively affects our common goal - the U.S.'s repression of the power, the repression, the repression, if we also do not continue to concentrate on the search.
They also noted that Kerry once again underscored the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to resist the Islamic State.”
On Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what action Russian troops are taking in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that the phone conversation with President Putin will be of benefit to us."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia’s decision to increase the support of the Assad regime to a “loss bet.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings - and as a result, the situation worsened," he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
Appropriate changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported by the assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, commissioned a number of departments - Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for the creation of goods.
In turn, the experts note that the main problem is a complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their ships abroad - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million annually go to the European states’ fines for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared the draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes" for the payment of fees and taxes, providing for the grant of a full conditional exemption.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - noted Lashkina.
This issue was brought before the Subcommittee on Customs, Non-tariff Regulations, Protective Measures in Foreign Trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which held its meeting in September, and was also approved following the discussion.

In the press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestiam" said that they have prepared mandatory regulations on the sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the design of seaports in the event and exit of small-scale, pamphlets.
The Ministry of Transport has given orders to the captains of the seaports of the Crimea to ensure the application of the simplified procedure of the operation of small-scale, sports sailing and walking vessels in the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport prepared draft orders of the government of the Russian Federation to approve the borders of the waters of the sea ports of the Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the reconciliation stage, - the press service of the ministry noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and scrutiny, state registration in respect of small-scale vessels used for non-commercial purposes, should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is a whole constantly developing industry, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts year-round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area there are extremely strict rules of border service: in order to go for a walk on the yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, within Russia, yachts could not even be refueled.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then the problem arises where to take it - says Nordmarine sales director Denis Novikov.
As for the places to store yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also the yachts are sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“The new funding will support a number of priority measures to carry out reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the statement said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimyao Fan, said that reforms of the banking sector will help to revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and in the World Bank are observing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the government of Ukraine to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the granting of a loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
In prisons, they are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
The Public Council of the Federal Penal Service (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Convicts in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks in the colonies for transgender and transvestite women.
About this "Izvestiam" told the council member Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicted in Russia, not determined by gender, it is possible to provide separate chambers, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in domestic prisons in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is only possible to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places after the convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the criminal is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the offenders.
According to him, the proposed practice is working successfully abroad: in the CISO (where the defendants are before a court decision) there are separate chambers for transgender people, and in correctional institutions there are special blocks.
Today, this is the only way out of working with such criminals.
They must be unequivocally isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, it is a suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of the trans people by the chamberlains is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, how many criminals with an undetermined gender, it is necessary to calculate where to distribute them.
There is no need for a separate SIS - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
According to Mr. Hryb, there may be 50 or 100 people in the block, and if a specialized body is created in Russia alone, the prisoners of transsexuals can go there from any region.
Citizens are included in the CISO at the crime scene, so the admission of transgender women or transgender women from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says Mr. Grib.
Recall that the day before, law enforcement officials were unable to decide in which investigative isolationist - male or female - to identify the drug-detained 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis) was a non-resident.
He was released from his home on a no-show.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as the mechanism of transgender content in SISO and colonies in Russia really does not yet exist.
The Russian human rights defender, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places to dispense with the punishment of their own transgender people, noting that it is also possible to define people in a colony abroad.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is right.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alexeyev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender ones.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia ready to pretend to be transsexuals in order to get into a colony different from the usual.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before placing people in a transgender colony, but not always everything happens unambiguously.
For example, in the United States, one of the inmates Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison stated that he wanted to change the gender, - said Alexeyev.
A person can feel anything they want.
But while there are no specific places to punish transgender people, I doubt that prison officials will take the safety of such people seriously and delve into the subtlety of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender criminals in the colony can greatly delay the beginning of the sentence of convicts.
A commission is created - it is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists carry out long-term observations, it is not a single test, on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today’s psychiatry capabilities allow for this.
Therefore, even before a gender change, potential patients always undergo such examinations – they accurately show whether a gender change with surgical intervention is the necessary measure,” says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to the convicted, since it takes an average of one month for such an examination.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people was supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if you consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, then you can say that transgender people are even less, and those who have such a deviation and even commit crimes, quite a small number.
Now, at the request of the colony administration, homosexuals, transgender people can obtain separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the World Chess Championship was completed among juniors under the age of 20.
The end of the championship seemed more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and they became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who still managed to force the Pole Jan-Kshishtof Dudu, who would seem confident to go to the title.
Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa celebrated the victory in the girls.
The World Chess Championship, which took place from the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to lose almost all intrigue, as the representative of Poland turveyed in the system Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who issued a series of four victories.
Given that Duda was a ranking favorite of the primacy, and is generally considered to be one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the resulting break was very negligible.
And even when Duda slowed down the turnover and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipova to reduce the lag to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov had to win in the 13th round to reach the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if you won the Dude's game.
Plus, this obligation to win could, of course, affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to non-obligatory mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He had to deal with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda to finish his game, who met with Benjamin Bok.
Luckily for Antipov, a Polish chess player brought a confrontation with a Dutch insider.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - by 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional scores.
That is why it is the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District, whose governor Natalya Komarova, traditionally paying great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the main prize.
But in the competitions of the girls of an intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Bukse (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to reach Buksa.
The Russian athlete remained second with a lag of the champion in 0.5 points.
It is changing the regional structure.

Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, said that the agency opposed the indexation of 10% tariffs on freight transport and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by OJSC RZD.
At first, they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and billions of dollars in budget subsidies, he says.
We say: it’s wrong, it’s too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, “much more stringent” proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.

Minpromtorg: Addressed food aid will not be similar to cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not be analogous to the card system of distribution of food that existed in the USSR.
It is about the modern address of food aid to the population and the support of an effective domestic commodity producer.
Please don't speculate on the word "food card."
In particular, it should be noted that the proposed food cards should not be confused with the past times of total deficit, the card distribution system, in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have proposed the concept for the time being, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," - quotes TASS words of Mr. Yevtukhov.
Earlier, the U.S. wrote that the program to introduce food cards for the underprivileged was introduced into the government.

Each participant is provided with a login and password to log in to the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can see information about the other participants and can make their assessments according to the proposed criteria for each functional area.
The basis of the methodology of rating construction is the principle of "the best choose the best": top managers evaluate the top managers, functional managers evaluate the functional managers.
Such a principle allows to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates for the current year’s rating and multiple candidates for the previous years’ rating are invited to the full meetings of the expert commissions.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission for the Approval of the List of Senior Leaders and the Eight Commissions for the Approval of the Heads of Functional Directions.
At the meetings of the expert commissions it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (the places are kept strictly according to the internet assessment and are closed information before publication of the rating) or to make the revisions to update them according to the applicable.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "I".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the lending market for small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panicked moods of the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015, the volume of loans to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Loans under 25-30% per annum were not beneficial to anyone.
If in the past the bank could place all its possible problems at a higher rate in the future, from delays to non-refunds, then now it is impossible to do it: bets and so cloudy.
For businesses, the current level of SME loan rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their return on investment.
The rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and form attractive returns on them.
To what extent do you believe that the demand for loans is satisfied?
After the decline of the central bank interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.
Today, business has one solution: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the movement of funds.
At the same time, in the presence of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies to modernize the equipment, reduce the cost of production and energy supply.
All of this, in the end, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What major trends in the SME lending market will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the average rate reduction will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is showing consistency in the issue of the key rate reduction.
However, a radical fall in the price of loans for SMEs is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to get real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even as the central bank’s interest rates fall.
If we talk about the level of delay, then traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited in both the ability to replenish funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
As well as the new CX-5 crossover, as, however, and any other model of the brand: without fragility attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
The Japanese already simply because of its "Japaneseness" is able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete enthusiasm.
You can make arguments in favor of cars from other countries as much as you want, and the person will even in principle agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will dissolve from the final sentence: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only the technique, but also everything else Japanese.
To quote from Base's move, to spice up the food of wasabi, to collect katanas and dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but on the canons of the street of Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps, the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure even after graduating from school.
It has amazing properties: at the same time, sensual, and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the grille of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But the new drawing of headlights and headlights, by which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars, changes the look much more.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance has a touch of rigor.
You won't have to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2-liter diesel engine delivers high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp - only 5.9 hp. The power unit is equipped with an exclusively automatic transmission and full drive.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda has made the utmost effort to ensure that you are not in the spot of your own accident behind the wheel of the CX-5.
To further enhance comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspensions redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the sleeves of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level of the road and the engine at high speeds was reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in flowers or stripes is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's a different matter if the girl sniffs in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing fighter.
Attention will then get no less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both the front and rear seats, which ensures optimal storage of space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Still long legs will certainly appreciate that the supports in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the expressions.
Mazda’s widest range of active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
In order to identify a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There's also adaptive lighting here, and a warning about getting off the track, and monitoring dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
Convenient, with a minimum of performance, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 - with each section equipped with a separate carrying lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurumi".
It looks especially nasty pyjamas.
You can do it all!
Of course he's sleeping.
But also entertaining young children.
Or just walking around like that on the street...
After all, it is so great when there is an opportunity to choose - funny clothes, behavior or a car.

Kyiv has broken the nuclear union.
Kiev formally announced Ukraine’s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant.
The Supreme Council on Wednesday, with a second attempt, nevertheless voted in favour of the dissolution of the agreement with Moscow.
The agreements for the construction of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the implementation of the project was never successful.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law that dissolves the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth block at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant.
The bill passed by the country's government was only successful from the second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 MPs with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 MPs voted in favour of the bill.
The Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant established under the USSR on the original project was to have four 1 GW power units with VVER-type reactors, but only two were able to be built.
Negotiations with Moscow on reconstruction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that building blocks would have to be on loan from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to twist relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant and on the construction project in Ukraine.
The only area in which relations have been maintained is the purchases in the Russian Federation of fuel for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity production in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NAEK "Energoatom" replace Russian supplies with nothing.
The plans to build the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: in 2014, negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev.
The UN General Assembly opposes the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that it is not possible to resolve the situation in Syria by military means.
“There is no military solution,” the AP said in response to a question about Syria’s military support from Russia.
Mr. Gui Moon also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of foreign affairs of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
“The meeting will be in Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of establishing an air base in Syria in the future.
There are no such plans yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, the U.S. did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to fight the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.
For more details on U.S. doubts about Russia’s aid to Syria, read the material “I” “Russia’s military presence in Syria worries Washington.”
The OSCE PA reports about a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of the OSCE, Arthur Gerasimov, announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the southeast of Ukraine.
“What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations,” Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “to return to the normal functioning of our countries.”
On the question of whether it is possible, in his opinion, at present, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the "Norman format" or in the format of the contact group on the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there is Minsk soglash.
At the same time, according to the policy, any kind of dialogue is supported in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, the former president of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations in principle, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections in the city duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 parliamentary mandates played on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were heard by representatives of the KPRF, who accused the poller of “covering forgeries”.
The opposition’s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the elector rejected the party "Communists of Russia" in the organization of a referendum on the cancellation of the fee for the renovation of multi-apartment houses.
The municipal constituency officially presented the results of the elections in the Pride of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the lists of voters in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballot papers were issued in the district commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand bulletins were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among the political parties depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia" six MP seats in pride are entrusted to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabet Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was received by the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the CPRF are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and Deputy of the State Duma Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of “Just Russia” are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must determine whether they will work as deputies in the city council: in the event of a resignation, he moves to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the Horizbirkom Aleksandr Makeev told the members of the commission that he is introducing the task of "sending telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" on the subject of refusal of mandates.
When the protocol on the results of the elections was approved, the representatives of the CPRF declared multiple violations.
A member of the Horizbirkom with the right of a consultative vote from the CPRF Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in the four districts No.21-24, recalling that at the order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building was closed.
Neither the deputies of the State of Udma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, could enter for a long time, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the door of the administration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
The head stopped accessing them only when the vote was over and the local commissions had not yet come to issue their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
“Then the chapter was corrected, and at all the meetings the interested persons could be present,” said the member of the mountain range Natalya Andryushin.
The Communists objected that in the blocked administration building more than four hours illegally detained deputy zak of the district assembly Ludmil Aristov, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of UICs on election day began sealing the ballots at 6-7 a.m., putting out bulletins for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the committees with the right to vote and the observers were not notified, so they arrived already at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations, they could uncontrollably throw bulletins into the urns.
However, the mountain electorate, who has already considered more than 124 complaints for various reasons, according to Alexander Makeyev, did not find any violations with the inserts of unreceived bulletins.
The members of the commission and their colleague from “Just Russia” Maria Popova did not support the proposal through the oblique collection to come out with amendments to regional legislation, to clearly set the time for the opening of envelopes with ballot papers of early voting, which then fall into the abyss.
"On your own initiative, at least contact the CEC," - advised Ms. Popovai Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, Sergei Samokhin, a member of the Communist Party of China (CCP), was accused of ignoring dozens of complaints and covering forgery in elections.
"You're not here at the rally, make a careful statement!" said the chairman sneered.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By September 27, the elector must approve the general election results, after which the first meeting of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the municipal electoral commission rejected the political party “Communists of Russia” in registering the initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to raise two questions for the discussion of the Nizhny Novgorod: whether they agree that the fees for the renovation of multi-apartment houses should be "immediately cancelled" and the tariffs for housing and utilities "freeze by 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova clarified that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" contradicts the legislation.
FedEx’s revenues are mixed, a decrease in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported unfortunate results in the last quarter, and the shipping giant has lowered its annual profit forecast due to a drop in demand for freight services and an increase in costs in its land transport division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its stocks were about 2.5 percent cheaper on pre-markets 45 minutes before the stock market opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to make between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The projection decline is seen despite an average rate hike of 4.9 percent, which will come into effect on January 4, and an increase in charges for land-based heavy or bulk cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it is still planning revenue growth compared to the previous year thanks to spending cuts, increased gross revenues, and increased online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company had "worked steadily, taking into account the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and world trade."
The day after UPS announced that it plans to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same amount as it had hired last year, the company said in a statement.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Revenue per share was $2.42, close to an average forecast of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research in a 12-analyst survey.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts surveyed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the urgent international transport sector, which has led to a lack of gross revenue growth in its express transport division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transport increased by 29%, but operating income remained unchanged as a whole due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The Express-Transport Unit received higher incomes due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector revenues fell due to increased labour costs.
On preliminary trades, about an hour before the opening of the FedEx stock exchange, FedEx fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, dropping 11 per cent a year and 17 per cent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras Red Tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated meeting room, two floors high above them will hang the wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank has received a double mandate from Congress: to maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal system have acknowledged that there is a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could prove to be an unknown factor in the almost-anticipated decision, which will be announced on Thursday, on whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term 2008.
Even though most of the data shows a confident growth of the economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets can keep the already cautious leaders of the Federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds – even a little bit of a profit.
“It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Peegza, chief economist at brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists polled by Bloomberg recently predicted interest rate growth this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from doing so, with the key indicator showing only about a 30 percent probability of a rapid rise.
This could lead to a stock market crash if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not mitigate the impact with a promise that the next raise will soon be.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The influx was sparked by expectations that the people who determine the federal system’s strategy would leave a bet this week,” said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time," he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve does so, “they will have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that the rate increase could reassure financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal system would work.
Just a month ago, the Federal system appeared to have tended to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that greater economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labor market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in more than seven years, and almost at what is considered full employment in the federal system.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s target annual rate of 2%, the federal system’s leadership said the key cause was the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the reduction in the labor market,” said Ian Schäferdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average index for industrial companies’ shares fell by as much as 16%, a record high in May, as investors feared a slowdown in China’s economy could slow global growth.
The market partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the May high.
For the management of the Federal Reserve system, market resentment further complicates difficult calculations of the term of interest rate increase.
“Without any knowledge of what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started screwing nuts at this meeting,” said Steven D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of Féderal.
Now, according to his predictions, they will wait for at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what the consequences might be for the U.S. economy, and they have hardly any reliable data after the recent events in China,” he said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve System has become a world financial power.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A single hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “shut down” its monetary expansion has triggered shocks in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it would be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will not only keep track of developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to improve the situation.
Their decision-making process is “more of an art than a science,” said Zakari Karabell, head of Investnet Inc., a company that deals with global asset management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve there have been cases of overreaction to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic principles.”
Lacker, a member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, led the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to the Federal system lowering its base rate by 0.75% over three meetings, “despite the limited identifiable consequences for growth in the United States,” Lacker said.
A year later, the leaders of the federal system canceled these cuts.
The federal reserve system should be placed first in stability only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The last panic didn’t come close to that level, he said.
“You certainly wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re scared of rising rates because markets are going through a shock,” said Pozen, president of the Peterson Institute of World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be ahead of the events.
Do you need a good Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/store opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also trades for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Tai Town.

There is even an automotive department if you need to buy oil for the engine.
The store is huge, and it will take more than an hour to clear all the rows.
If shopping is starving, buy food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The culinary department in the store (good and inexpensive) is not far from the cash register and offers various options for withdrawal.
What is offered: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably does.
The prices of goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes delicacy of Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits, and more.
The meat shelf is varied, as is the fish - the staff behind the shelf cleans and divides the fish, and even roasts it for you if you want.
The bulk of the store is placed under an impressive freezer, where you will find frozen leaves of curry, bitter pumpkin and gallon, whole duck, fish, beef blood and bile, pork chops, yogurt, local sausage, semi-finished and many others.
Who buys there: Owners and chefs of restaurants, as well as families and individual buyers.
In the wide passage there are also shopping carts, and forklifts.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually not difficult to find.
State Duma Speaker Sergei Narishkin admits that the United States intentionally destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees can crawl into Europe.
According to Interfax, he told journalists in Ulaanbaatar as part of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a fan of conspiracy theories, but the question is: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such manic persistence in recent years?” he asked.
“After all, someone must have guessed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and helpless people, who are saved from death, will aspire to the prosperous countries of the EU,” he added.
Naryshkin asked, “Have many of Europe’s political leaders been frank about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally swallowing their countries?”
“No, the old Europe, with the rare exception, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO undermines many European values and norms of international law.
“Unfortunately, Europe has long and unbiasedly looked at and looks at how the military sash, sewn to NATO standards, also dissolves moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” he said.
The government forces and their loyal militias are confronted by rebels, mainly Islamists.
Later on, the Syrian government's opponents joined the banned terrorist group "Islamic State" in Russia.
The U.S. supports rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such insurgents to be terrorists.
The president of Syria called the cause of the West's hostility to Russia.
The West’s claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran lie in the fact that they are sovereign states.
Such an opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, the First Channel, "Russia 24", NTV, "Russia Today", TASS, "Interfax" and "Russian Newspaper".
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who would act in the interests of the Western countries and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turnaround of the Western media with the start of the turnaround in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections".
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves, it is at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Commune.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also battling terrorism along with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of Iran’s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, the economy and the military sphere.
He refuted claims that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he said.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them in the face of a serious desire to combat terrorism.
“We don’t see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-igil coalition led by the United States,” Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist group “Islamic State”, which is banned in Russia.
An international coalition led by the United States is launching airstrikes against ISIS.
12 people were killed in the flood in Utah.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of the flood.
Another one is believed to be missing, reports Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
The water washed several cars with the people who were in them in the district of Washington.
One of them, the van, where the family was, stopped in a dangerous area near the water, and the flow suddenly caught him.
The youngest of the victims was four years old.
All of the victims are residents of the Colorado City and Hildale districts, which have fallen into disrepair.
There are also reports of three children who were rescued.
650 teams are involved in search-and-rescue work.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any additional details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to “further isolate Russia” if it will support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
As reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov during the conversation with Kerry again emphasized the need to create a united front against the terrorist groups operating on the territory of the country.
It also discussed ways of resolving the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, a number of issues of a bilateral nature were addressed.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow’s intensification of Assad’s support.
In Washington, they said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not get into international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization “Islamic State”.
An international coalition led by the United States is subjecting ISIS positions to airstrikes.
Boroday called the news of the American newspaper an insult to Strelkov.
Former head of government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Boroday, denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent "Lenty.ru".
The note in the Washington Post is that everything is clean.
Former Defense Minister of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and "came out" from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very elevated mood, without ropes, without three furrows of money, which are attributed to him from different characters.
According to Borodya, the talk about Strelkov in a conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper really went.
"Yes, I said that Strelkova was urgently required to remove from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of government of the DPR said.
Borodai stressed that he is not aware why a correspondent of the American publication decided to write about that Strelkov was exported to the territory of Russia "connected".
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it is not a provocation, then it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov left alone," - said Borodai.
"This is an insult to both me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post there was an article that quoted the words of Borodaya that he exported Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a coercive manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie his partner.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish loggers began to cut down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the reliability of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a train with gold is no more convincing than the previous one.
However, the authorities decided to cut off the search area.
Three days before that, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Zhukhovsky, said that local treasure hunters with a "99 percent probability" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhi with a message that they found the train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation has proposed a ban on the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21.
Russia’s top narcologist has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Braun noted that before this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - acts particularly harmful."
So he said in a live broadcast of the radio station "Govorit Moscow", commenting on the information that the Speaker of the Council Valentin Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
The man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person physically ready for it.
Mentally, he is ready for a full-fledged life in society from the age of 21.
“It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, matures definitively only by the age of 21.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Treasurying Russia" Sultan Hamzaev informed "Izvestiam" that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age of the sale of alcohol and "agreed to the couple together with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Federation Council to develop the bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible Asked to Check for Conformity with Children’s Information Protection Law
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor’s office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On protecting children from information that harms their health and development”, with a statement on September 16 met the correspondent Sib.fm.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the shop "City City" on Red Avenue.
In the text of the book, he discovered fragments that, in his view, violate the FZ "On protecting children from information that harms their health and development".
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor's office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the address of the resident of Novosibirsk will be within 30 days.
The point is not to ban a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, this is a very serious problem that will shatter society.
But he will begin to read the Bible, which he had not done before.
Brazilian Union of Rio Grande Paediatricians Promotes Healthy Nutrition for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the demonstration of images of infants, breastfeeding, written with images of indigestion.
Breast milk contains a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant and unborn women, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie level by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one calorie increase is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy eating on the child’s immune system have been identified.
Under Hamburg, a school bus crashed into the train.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus, which was stuck on the railroad.
The 23-year-old driver, knowing she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in their eyes.
The video was shot by one of the students.
Due to the emergency situation among the students, there was panic.
Some children began to cry and run along the side.
The route is still blocked, however.
According to the police, no one was injured by a miracle, except one passenger on the train, who received minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with the victory of Maghali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was admitted to the hospital with a cerebral trauma.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the life-sustaining apparatus.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one battle ended in a draw.
He has two children left.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Bradon Smith died of injuries sustained in the ring.
Now the AMA recommends not to engage in this kind of sport, but better, from its point of view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is happening inadvertently," said Steven Pernis, the vice president of the organization.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when an athlete gets a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that unites practicing physicians and medical students. . . .
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma Speaker Sergei Narishkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians inadmissible.
This was stated by speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as an unacceptable act, an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue,” he said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let’s get morale back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return the humanist ideals to a democratic world order.
“The duality never ended with anything good,” he said.
Speaking from the tribune of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,” Narishkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should pay tribute.
"This is almost the only common platform where we are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," he said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
I enjoyed winning for a couple of days.
World champion in light athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphal for 24-year-old Barnaul lightweight Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed to win at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers at the European team championship, set several records, and most importantly - become a world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Brilliant League", taking third place in the overall score.
"New News" asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the departing season.
Sergey, the season is not over yet for you?
Yes, I’m going to perform at the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I’m going to think about rest.
I'm going to be at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is a completely different situation.
It's easier than movin' around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
Passions after the main start of the season have deflected, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete for pleasure, for "relaxation."
Plus, you know, the holidays are coming soon...
Is there fatigue?
However, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Tiredness always accumulates by the end of the season.
It doesn’t matter what he did more – he won or he lost.
Every competition is a stressful one.
Constant flights, transfers - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
What's that? I'm just happy!
By the time you finish at the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
Yes, it does.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget about that.
But in general, I think that bad that athlete who lives with old victories, spins his successful races over and over again.
I've been enjoying winning for a couple of days, and I need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter racing season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at reunions, then at home again.
It's just like usual.
But the coach and I set a goal: to try to get to a new level that I haven’t been to yet.
Almost all of the winter time was spent laying down the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did exercises for general physical training, which included both traction, and the seat, and the back we pumped.
Then we took on the barrier training, a lot of technique.
The way the opponents act, you see?
I always try to do it, good in the age of the Internet there is no problem with it.
I watched the European Winter Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I also thought: something needs to be done, to dilute this company.
With each start of this season you have added and added in the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I have all the last seasons going on about the same schedule.
There's no such thing as running first at 13.20 and then at 13.50.
I’m always changing my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to get out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you’re ready for feats, and in competitions, it’s not always possible to show your readiness.
What was it like at the London Olympics, for example?
I, to be honest, tried to forget the semi-final race (Shubenkov could not go back to the final. - "NO") immediately.
He was very good, he could really run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at the time, he would become a bronze medalist of the Games.
But I wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
How's that?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to go to the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And he went off straight from tomorrow, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that to tear and wear a broken head - it means not going anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he has already reached the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings well before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold" already then!
How can you, by developing a decent speed, not lose your head and not turn off?
And that's the most difficult thing.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to break down barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, so much easier.
And the hardest part is when you get the feeling that you're running and everything seems to work itself out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after the first major successes are looking to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
Home is still better.
I can't imagine where I am without my coach, who do I need?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
Q. Have you been together for a long time?
Since I was 12 years old, since I went into athletics.
To be more precise, I first trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she already handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, tripled.
The children's multiplayer was - it's when they throw the ball, jump long from the place...
At 14 I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race, it was possible to meet the standards of the second adult class.
That's what it is.
Have you ever been afraid of barriers?
I was able to get a deal with them right away.
I always had to work a lot on the technology.
There's a rush over how much he's been tormented!
But you can’t get away from this routine.
The technique needs to be tuned constantly - in order to wake me up at night, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Anyone who has seen your race in Beijing says it was a very beautiful race.
Oh, thank you.
I liked it myself, too.
I don't usually revisit my races, and I couldn't stop here.
But efficiency needs to be worked on - there are no limits to perfection.
Are you not afraid now that the victory a year before the Olympics will lie on your shoulders with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, it must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you’re not weak, you shouldn’t feel any extra burden.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I'm not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them with bread - give it to the enemy.
And while I wasn't cheating on the flag, and the same thing, I spoke a million times here, and I didn't call anyone an asshole directly, I was struck by something else.
All my pseudo-friends blinked, in a second they disappeared somewhere.
The pressure that I am subjected to is so strong that even I, who have seen the kinds of boys, think that people are white.
It's like he was walking, walking, and you were attacked by a crowd, and you were mutilated with rods.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a hawk, I'm a hawk, I'm old, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so eat it.
And giving passports to assholes like Fred Durst or Monson can only be fools.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a disgraceful job.
A week ago in Kyiv, Otar Kushanashvili described the Crimean events in a sharp form:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called an annexation.
I believe that the reference to the way Khrushchev was trying to sign something does not in any way fit into the general picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his place...
The Kremlin war is over, and it will only end there.
I’m almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some asshole from the Kremlin wall.
I'm guessing who it might have been...
Cobbson has not had much to live on.
I don’t understand, he is the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they took a monument from him.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his little homeland.
Reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven leads in the ranking despite attempts of the Ninth to illuminate the loss of the leaders in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson’s departure to Canberra to shed light on the consequences of the Liberal Party’s statement to liberate the leader’s seat failed to significantly raise the Today rating.
The morning show of Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott.
The competitor - Sunrise - with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, stuck in London as part of a weekly series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This long-distance torture seems to have been of little importance to Australian viewers, with the Sunrise audience having 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
Today scored a little more compared to its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus Today’s 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Posted TODAY on Monday, September 14th, 2015.
An important news for the Seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, has garnered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics have debated whether Thomson can handle the popular show alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a loud "yes" answer.
The X Factor Seven remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV show, led by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446,000 spectators.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat by Eddie MacGyver (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour was overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall in Chase Australia ratings on the second evening will make the ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to win the MacGyver show.

The three finalists agree that "Blonde" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellow, Sarah McCain, and Snowden Markosky may have accidentally made it clear which of them will win the Holostyak.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in The Hollow is surrounded by a curtain of mystery.
And the three who reached the final of the girl, of course, keep the silence about who of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McCain, Snowden Markosky, and Lana Jevons-Fellow on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to stay, they might have unexpectedly given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood will remain silent until the final, which will take place on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, and lifelikeness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question, “If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?” they could involuntarily tell which of them actually won the heart of Holostyak.
Jeeves-Fellow and Marcossky undoubtedly called McCain the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
“From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy [Sara] and Sam’s energy and realized that they were very good for each other, and throughout the show, I had no doubt about that,” Jeevons-Fellowe said.
“Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun with her,” added Marcoski.
I've seen them together, there's really attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McCain believes that she and Sam Wood will be a great couple.
McCain himself said that thanks to last week’s home dates, she realized that Wood might be “the man himself.”
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it wasn’t just a game – I trusted him with all my heart,” she said.
When asked who Voodoo should choose, if it wasn’t her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls alike, and Snezhana and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The Bachelor's show will be released Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were keenly interested in him after he moved to the U.S. - as were many other clubs that sent inquiries after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayn chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the sidelines for the remainder of the game for the loss of the ball, which a former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the pant in a winning game with Minnesota with an account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to return the bat, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of making a difference for the newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers Special Reporter Kem Inman said Hayne also received support from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the pant by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
This was the start of the NHL debut, which Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not expect.
It was evident that Hayne was arguing as he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told the show's lead "Hamish and Andy" on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start for his career in the NFL.
“That’s what happens, you just think about the next game and that’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his failure to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a throw of the ball in his score zone brought Queensland's attempt.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne was photographed with an Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a photo on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of using weapons at a Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were hampered.
There have been clashes between migrants and police on the Hungarian border.
Refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian town of Reske, which have turned into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water bottles and tear gas, according to Reuters.
The migrants throw stones at the police and try to take down the fence on the border.
The site of the clashes is being reinforced, police take action in response to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to breach the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country allowed the migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian Parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for the examination of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
In the near future, the Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider the transfer of border protection functions to the Hungarian Armed Forces of the country’s parliament.
At the end of June, Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km long barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest cyberattack in U.S. history.
Indicted in the largest cyber attack in U.S. history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman has confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During the trial in the federal court of New Jersey, Drunkman confessed to a conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about a conspiracy with three citizens of Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damages from the actions of the accused were estimated at $300 million.
“The defendants, such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security,” U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a million-dollar fine.
When issuing a sentence, the court will take into account the recognition of the Russian and may reduce the time limit for him.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect Dmitry Smilianets was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes he is charged with.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia’s support of Bashar Assad’s regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support of Syrian President Bashar Assad exacerbated the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism, if we do not focus on the U.S. coup d'état in the coup d'état - the search for a solution to the conflict in Syria."
Kerry confirmed the U.S. commitment to combating the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the secretary of state, Assad “can never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed in a telephone conversation that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved by a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
On Monday, White House Press Secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
Alternatively, Ernest proposed joining the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has often reported the presence of Russian military personnel in the territory of Syria.
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping the Syrians to master the technique to apply it against the Islamists.
Four people were killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began firing rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandea County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country’s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before launching rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, have caused such high mortality.
The clash was the last in weeks of fierce protests in southern, flat Nepal, where representatives of the Madési people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among Tara nationalities who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province, it became a decisive step on the way to a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally ruled for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted in favour of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has an advanced infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by the new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects he told the correspondent "Oblastna".
Oleg Valerievich, why did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I became acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the expenditure of the local budget.
Subsequently, the municipal property was audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce document turnover to five days.
Previously, the documents on the instances could have gone for months.
Activities have been developed to increase the income base and optimise costs.
In November last year, a departure meeting of the government was held in Saiyansk, where the issues of the socio-economic development of the territory were discussed.
There was no project-based documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of PSD for roads, kindergarten, northern sewerage collector and sewerage.
Roadworks are already underway in two areas.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Saiyansk.
No such positive demographics have been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of securing places in kindergartens is one of the most relevant today.
From 1 September closed for major repair of kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repair was made on the conditions of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were found, and the program "People's Initiatives" was also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children aged from one and a half to three years.
We do not have queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, by Siyan enterprises, it is they need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphaned children in the Leningradsky microdistrict is put into operation.
As for construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarh, which entered into the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing for those who want to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions - housing should not be more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this price includes a "key" finish.
If we manage the specified volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
At the time, the Saiyan pig complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for invaluable price.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to protest this deal.
Particularly because the land under the object is federal property.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transfer of 88 hectares to regional property is resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the project 1.5 billion rubles.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great support for the city.
Has the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Saiyansk?
We have signed about 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects were successful thanks to the active social position of the business representatives.
Emphasisable support is provided by enterprises such as ZAO "Vostok-Centr", Novo-Ziminskaya TEC, LLC "Sayan Broiler", LLC "PK MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly on the Day of the city, "Sayan Broiler" LLC gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Centr" carried out the repair of the horse yard, where specialists deal with children hypotherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles on it.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city ZAGS.
Sponsors helped to mark the city’s day.
As in the old good times, a parade was held with the participation of urban collectives and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
The first builders and people, who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Saiyansk, were awarded the anniversary medals.
The patrons are also involved in the work of the city charity fund.
The very first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 rubles are allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How do you solve the human resources problems in the social sphere in Saiyansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and pedagogues in the city.
The provision of housing for specialists is of great importance for the solution of the personnel issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have received the service housing.
We have a housing program with the possibility to privatize it in five years.
The plan is to replan the building, in which will be built eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for employees of the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Saiyansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of pensions taking into account the increase in prices.
The State Duma has introduced a bill that provides for the indexation of social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - deputy of "Just Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Romantsev - also proposes to carry out additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
The indexation of pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the rate of growth of the minimum living pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The bill, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of the indexation of social pensions, taking into account the pace of the growth of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexing is postponed to February 1, and the second is carried out on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA said Mogherini was inadmissible to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA spokesperson Ilkka Kanerva declared the inadmissibility of sanctions against legislators participating in the events of the Assembly.
This was reported by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, in support of Kanerva’s position, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were collected.
"A strong enough support has already been formed," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he said that the head of the OSCE PA had spoken with the intention of collecting the signatures of deputies, which indicated the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions on parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the leading structures of the European Union and "send a corresponding petition".
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape islands is 60 percent.
The wide front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another clearly outlined low-pressure area roughly midway between the Green Cape Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, Miami synoptics reported.
Google launches a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the start of a doubling of donations campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help displaced European countries refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has used an uncharacteristic personal approach, announcing a campaign to collect donations on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masud, who had fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
“We got on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has escalated, so many people like my family desperately need help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations dedicated to helping refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief page reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest refugee crisis since World War II, triggered by the majority of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity may be able to help obesity surgery.
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low obesity who suffer from type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to claim that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality statistics aren’t showing up right away,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in the column of the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organisms to absorb food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
The BMI, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI 25 or above indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI above 30 are considered obese people.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery – gastric shunting and arm gastrectomy, with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in non-men.
The mean BMI of those who had undergone surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about level 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% fully recovered from diabetes, and partly - 28%.
In the group that received medication, for comparison, complete cure of diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partial - only about 2%.
In addition, indicators of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also monitored levels of hemoglobin A1s in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best glycemic control indicators reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c did not reduce mortality over five years, according to the head of the study, Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to the group who had a half-shoulder gastrectomy, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (by 7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c by 9% (by 3.1% versus 2.1%), and also had a greater decrease in sex.
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from the results of a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment of the ulterior flexo actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying over 15 years was approximately 29% lower compared to the group who used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“Here the report is very important because it states that such a surgical intervention is safe in a group with low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient’s BMI reaches the range between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take it seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytyshchy, the robbers took the fur out of the house and 9 million rubles.
In Mytyshchy, the robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
This is reported by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people entered the house on Gorky Street through an open door, tied the 20-year-old son of the housekeeper and, threatening both with a knife, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three furs.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal case under the article "Razboj" was initiated.
Fans of Europe are at risk of being homeless.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to accommodate tourists who will come in 2018 to watch the World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get their permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
Interlocutors of "Rosbalta" believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting removable apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for removable housing will have to pay over.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically for priority, each St. Petersburg hotel must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the stated number of stars and level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
As told the head of the UFAS, Vadim Vladimirov, the agency studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the antimonopoly.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the citizens, placing one or the other number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now on the account literally every number, not one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star hotels.
According to the first deputy committee on the development of tourism Nana of Guyana, at the moment, only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many checks were carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel has ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny is not known for the surprising merger of circumstances.
That is, there may be more past classification, but no one knows about it.
“In the last six months, hotels have not been very keen to pass the classification,” said the director of the North-Western branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers make the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason - budgets, in which there were no costs for checks, at the same time the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
But lately, hotel managers have become more active and have begun to apply for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels must be successful by July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will not even get the right to work at the world championship.
It is already known that depending on the star rating will be developed a fixed fee for the hotel room at the time of the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done to prevent the price from rising by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to be conscious and not allow an increase of two or three times, but also hotels need to be given to earn.
“I think the growth will be up to 50%,” explained the president of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixation corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don’t know how much this is in the context of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than a nonstop trip," he said.
It is not clear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma have introduced a bill that states that hostels should be banned in residential houses.
We very much hope that this law will not be passed or will not affect St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved,” says Nana Guachiya.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the Duma still approves the bill, about 80% of the hostels will be closed in St. Petersburg, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand rooms in them.
According to Leonid Garbar, president of the Federation of North-West Restaurants and Hotels, there is a shortage of two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a pavement towards hotels with four and five stars.
The situation is similar to the situation where “75,000 VPs are sitting in the 80,000 stadium.”
This can be repaired at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert considers “idiotism”: “It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors can’t.”
If the hostel is used as a dormitory, I agree that it is wrong.
But if as a hotel that guests come to for a short time, why not?
Mini-hotels run the risk of missing out on the World Cup because of their non-smokers.
Hundreds of small hotels simply fail to pass the classification, and the pits dig themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will order work.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse to pay less orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that will travel," Gennady Lamshin noted, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, were given a momentary exit.
The reason for the delay in St. Petersburg is due, among other things, to constant shifts in the government’s tourist block, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, you will most likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
According to the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be prepared to come in the vans, in which you will be able to stay overnight.
“The main thing is not to set up so many hotels so that they then empty,” says Gennady Lamshin.
It will also be very popular during the football championship to use removable housing.
Most likely in the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
"Of course - the first will leave housing near the stadium," - noted the agency's development and real estate research specialist Larisa Bragin.
And the rent may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Don’t forget about the human qualities of the people.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that St. Petersburg has always been a welcoming city where people not only point the way, but can also take a mini-tour.
There are complications as well.
In the 1970s, my father met a family in Murmansk, a father, a mother and two children.
They had nowhere to sleep: it was difficult with the hotels at the time, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
“And Dad took them to our communal apartment to sleep,” the interviewer recalled.
However, he added that now such a trait in the inhabitants of the city is not left - to call home is full of consequences and terrible.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the former?
Zhirinovsky "slily" Amur region.
With admiration today I looked at the clown Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did such things when our generation had just learned to trade newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech is “the LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region”.
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; other protocols than those signed by the electors, the LDPR, as it were, do not.
Here he raises the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like, "Here is the winner of the election!"
And right away he throws himself at Rodnin, and then, after a fight already with the chairman, takes the faction out of the meeting room, literally shouting "You're all with the fronts of your swindlers and thieves."
The press, of course, emphasizes not Abramov, but the scandal and demarch of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
In reality, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another Zhirinovsky exit in the style of “Podonki!”, and not at all a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the site of the party and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader obviously drops from the topic.
He allows the dead to bury their dead on Amur himself, and he himself preaches the gospel against the "Unified Russia" in general and in no fault of his kin.
A polite decision so that the face does not lose, and in the real, not show scandal do not go.
The other thing is that Abram himself is now in a strange position.
Apart from the cries of the chief, he did not expect anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
It is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other hand, for a narrow circle it has become a formal occasion and to insult the esteemed champion, and, more importantly, the cases of Ham towards the ER and the ONF.
And here, of course, he has to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the region’s No. 2 policy and the No. 1 candidate for the only regional single-mandate district, he can turn into a bet that was successfully used by his own party leadership and the super-rival for the ONF and the party leadership of the other.
There would have been no Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and observed respectfully.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There is news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
The bathroom didn’t fall at all.
The theme of Abramov was buried under him.
It's beautiful, really.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Center in Oxford, dedicated to ethical research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that under the existing circumstances, the interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while this is a source of admiration, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama strongly retorted about the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary decision.
“Caring for thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist acts, saying that the U.S.’s harsh reaction has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children swallowing hand sanitizers over the past four years
Toxicology centers in the United States reported an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a high alcohol disinfectant, as reported by the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Hailord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, cases of ingestion by children under 12 years of age of hand disinfection fluids reported in toxicology centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are in contact with these substances more often, and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are sent to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluids on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue on social media.
The videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents reportedly mixed the disinfectant fluid with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Children of younger age can attract pleasant smells of disinfectant liquid.
“The child doesn’t think it could hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are flavored.
There are hand disinfectant liquids with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The disinfectant for the hands contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a high-concentration alcohol,” said Dr. Steven Thornton, chief physician at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t just leave a can of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if the kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand disinfectant with a potato scent in about four sprays at school, was sent for treatment to an ambulance.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice as high as an adult who is legally considered to be in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell down and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchie said.
“It was very scary,” Orthoria Scott, Naji’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant liquids for hands from children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which has been identified as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in northern New York agreed to poison their "opposite" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand sanitizers, and she has banned keeping them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was “empty conversations” and address discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the children's regional library named after N.K. Krupskaya is saddened by an iron owl.
The children who come for the books are trying to feed her with candy.
For several generations he has been going to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twentieth century organized loud readings here, put performances on Mayakovsky’s poems, conducted literary quizzes and rewritten with Lenin’s wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper Young Stalin wrote in 1939, each day "the friendship between Hope of Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" grew stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even once sent her childhood photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna was interested in assigning her name to the library, she wrote that no, she did not.
The letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandsons and great-grandsons of the first readers have to explain whose rough profile adorns the baroque on the building of the library.
In the years of the renovations, different people often called, angry: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without political color!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a track of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and was different from all other managers only in her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the internet: "It takes an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a young American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My Mom Has Cancer."
Olya did the illustrations and thought that life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children’s books by writers all over the world, and writes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in a book, that they are increasingly living in some kind of virtual space.
But some children come to us reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - says the director of the library Tatyana Kushvid.
In recent years we even have such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it will live - the children come here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library there is a large exhibition glazing with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library of the whole family: mom, dad and children.
The library is glad that dads are coming with children more and more often.
If at two years a child read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law that prohibits the eight-year-old vonderkind from issuing 12<0x2B> books.
To get such a book, the child must bring parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of jewels with jaws and eras, tell Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", embroidery "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of “the temple of the book”, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, - explains Tatyana Kushvid.
We can all come together to read, play, and draw.
We made a play area for the kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand still stretches to the book!
Some of our readers will be carried by their parents, and they stand on their feet, do not want to leave.
Mothers with strollers often come - and we are glad that they put the library first among all the other places where you have to go with the babies.
Tatyana Kushvid says: Modern children, as we used to, love classic children’s literature:
“The publishing business is evolving now, and a lot of attention is being paid to the authors who are the link between the generations.”
And when it comes to small children, it’s important for them to be some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don’t like to break up with their heroes.
The library is constantly issuing booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books are worth paying attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
Bringing books outside the reading room is prohibited for adults.
This magical privilege is only for children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the bookstore.
The feet will vibrate under your steps - it is already a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood, you meet like an old friend: hello, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie still walks along the road with a yellow brick, Toly Ryzhykov's tapes steals magic beads, and Malchish-Kibalchish never told the damned bourgeois of the Military Secret - that's the hard word he has.
Such books are like passwords, by them you can know yours anywhere.
There are in the repository and real book rarities - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection with jaws and eras.
Or tell Korolenko in a famous app for the magazine "Niva".
Or embroidery "Murzilki" for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, colored them in tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream of going out of retirement and taking care of rare children's books.
But the children will not act on this already, so to speak: and the paints in the old books are not very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write this "Pioneer Truth?"
But it was still interesting, - tells "Russian Planet" Galina Ilyasov, who leads the bookstore.
The pages of "Murzilki" have been obscured from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna leads the bookstore all her life.
She knows the color of the cap in Buratino, the school year in which Harry Potter captained Griffindor's team at the quidding championship, the situations in which Carlson used a silencer for a motorcycle, and who Alice Selezneva's father works.
The work of a librarian is paid little, and everyone who can live without these lines of books very quickly finds a different profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, educators, clergymen of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, he is a professional.
I love children's books in general: as a librarian I like to have them so that they stand flat and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me back then.
And because I loved them crazy, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone is sitting and reading.
I hope that the books will always be, despite the riders.
And I am glad that our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
Mill of rumours: In "Seltika" there are no disagreements
Griffiths denied talks about differences in the Celtics after Dale admitted that Hopps was in a bad position, but he would fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association’s claim to Nelson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could violate the team’s unity.
"Dons" increased the advantage over "Seltik" to five points
Adam Rooney's Penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, allowing the Dons to break away from the Celtics by five points.
Griffiths Denies Discussions About Disagreements
This sparked rumors of disagreements in the Celtics, which were intercepted by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any intensified criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
“I don’t think we’re feeling tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title – de Bourne
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch team member Ronald de Burr said Dutch footballers had lost interest in Celtic because he did not compete for the title with the Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ajax, said: "The Netherlands no longer shows the most attractive moments of the game of Celtics, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They’re talking about both teams together, and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of tension in Old Firm games, and it’s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
“I’m going to betray everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
After the defeat of Malmö and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League soon followed the loss of 10 footballers "Aberdina", who now, breaking down by five points, takes the top line of the table.
However, Dale said, "Selitka has had bad periods before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what’s going on.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the support of Celtics, because that's what makes the players so much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Worberton is looking forward to January transfers
Despite opinions that appeared just a few weeks ago suggesting that he had set some of the goals of the January transfers, Ranger boss Mark Warberton mistrustfully refers to the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the team’s unity.
The former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own team this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in "Seltik", hinted at the end of his career
Suonsi Mitch, who was tied to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave the football after his contract with the Lebeds ended.
The 29-year-old suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to oppose the SFA over Nelson's statements.
The Harts led 2–1 when they removed Patterson, and started losing 3:2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; it was the third red card of Collum, cancelled in eight months.
Nelson does not give up his words, stating, "I have not questioned the ethics, I have not commented on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynecastle
A stubborn player from the team "Haubernian" received an apology after admitting to singing the song with insulting words about former player "Harts" Rudy Scatsella.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburne area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby at Tyncasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was a burning one," the striker said, adding, "I can confidently say that I wasn't going back to Tynecastle unless he plays for Celtic.
Donnelly: Thanadis Council is confident in the management of Dandy United
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of Dandy United is still confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the ground must end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We're going to prepare the guys to go out again," Donnelly said.
McKinnes is glad he won at Hamilton's.
Derek McKinness conceded that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assisi to achieve a seventh consecutive league championship victory, which put them five points higher than Celtic, the top of the tournament table, thanks to a penalty shootout.
McInness said: “There is no team here that would win anything – a cup, or a league championship, that didn’t win the match in a similar way.”
Unemployment rates among Scots do not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole they increase.
RESEARCH in Scotland remained at 164,000 for the period from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was higher than in the United Kingdom at 5.5%, as the figures of the National Statistics Service (ONS) showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, with the number now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by quarter to 74.0%, which is higher than the average figure of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scotland’s Minister of State, David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The government’s long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labour market as employment increases and unemployment decreases.
Why I'm a Witness to the Execution in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will be watching the execution of a person.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the watch gallery of the Oklahoma State Prison Killer Camera when Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was in shock, I agreed.
As the day approached, I was afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique recursion.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and because they often want more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever has been chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we have had our own relationship with him after several months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to them.
The prison administration says I can’t be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I’m not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma has accused me on Twitter of acting in a way that is fair to me.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated better" herself, but still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he said it.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international newspaper reporter to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to go into the details here again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treez make him guilty of assisting in the crime.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure that evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that angle, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'm being objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
From me, you'll learn what it's like to watch the person I like die without need.
The man being chased by the police was told to get out of the Canning River
The Constable of Canning Valley managed to persuade a man to leave the Canning River and remain dry.
The resident of Perta intended to escape from the police, but failed to get stuck in dirty water on a shallow water a few meters from the police officer, trying to "softly persuade him to go to the shore."
Canning Valley police were called on Tuesday for illegally infiltrating someone else’s territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to run away from them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
“He stood in the water and said, ‘I’m not going out, let’s go, grab me,’” said Senior Sergeant Sandell Castledine.
Constable Laklan Perhavez didn’t want to urinate, so he used a safer reception – “negotiations with a good policeman.”
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledaye.
That’s what football champion Ben Kazins remembers.
In 2006, Kazins went to the quay to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts turned out to be futile, but encouraged locals to invent a joking "Ben Kazins biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempting espionage and threatens to quit horse racing
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards of attempting to insert a spy into his stable last year and threatened to immediately quit horse racing.
His target was the stewards and employees of the Racing Victoria ethics department, whom he accused of personally organizing a campaign against him, and the withdrawal from Lady Tatay's start because of a violation of drug rules on the day of the start, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the races, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidara’s test on the cobalt, which he can’t explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and did not want it to "look like a green grape."
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve endured for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of the way that you don’t hold back anymore,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head high and I want my owners to know that I am doing my best for them.
“When they start to think it’s not so, then I’ll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would call if asked and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I was doing in my stable,” Mudy told Racing.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If so, all of them should no doubt submit applications, because the attempt to catch me failed.
Robert Rolstone, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, former chief executive of RVL, knew about this all the time and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think that it's becoming personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to take responsibility for what’s going on in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people out there think that’s the way it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and it's sad for me.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and put them in charge of making decisions.
I have support from my family, and I can leave.
The coach’s frustration only grew during a lengthy investigation into the Cobalt and Lidara case, and the latest horse withdrawal from the start forced him to state that he could “put his license on the table.”
Mudy, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition "smiling" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's legs, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules of the race.
“I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly compressed her leg.
She could've gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him on the day of the run.
Mudi may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition for the use of a compress, about which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
The people who make these rules don’t know anything about horses.
“We all know we need rules, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver, who drove and hid from the scene of the incident in Cobram, was arrested
Police arrested a man who shot down a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
The biker was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was shot down by a car at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver had left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene of the incident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobrama, remains in stable condition in the hospital.
"Melbourne Storm" coach Craig Bellamy blames rivals for using harsh force techniques
"Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's interception of the ball a "fixing of the agenda" by two NRL champions.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" his team during the sudden victory of the Storm in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at the Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament at the Nose Queensland Cowboys were out of the squad's squad on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" and "religious".
Bellamy defended his team's interception of the ball and said they were simply focused on "contact" intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he had the confidence of his team's criticism from the two leading coaches, as this means that they are concerned about a possible defeat from Storm.
"It keeps popping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the tough tricks when they beat us with a score of 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven’t changed anything for a year in our defense systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks we’ve paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and it’s been a turning point for us.
“Trent has been there for three years and he’s obviously training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and for him it’s been a bit of a shock.
Funny how it always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy disputed Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that "St. George Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
"He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized a lot by calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It’s a football you’d like to play when you have players like that.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two such midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because they’re a bit of a concern to play with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that Storm and Rusters were a competition with more points than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the count? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is this an impressive football?
Or consider it impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
This is routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm has at the end of this weekend, as they have won the right to take either the North Queensland Cowboys, or the Cronall Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale in the next round.
The Serb accused in the storage of drugs is issued on bail of $200,000
A man threatened with life imprisonment for attempting to assign 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling, was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht that sailed from South America via Vanuatu and had sunk into Kumara in August.
Throughout the morning Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen at the docks, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich is threatened with a lifespan for trying to assign drugs in quantities sufficient for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole batch in the past.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksimovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal trial, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich's mother and father were offered a joint bond of $200,000 for his release.
“From the testimony of both, it becomes clear that the amount of the $200,000 bail is too much a financial burden for them,” Flanagan said.
But one such measure is not enough to guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovich was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he would hand over both his Australian and Serbian passport, will be registered with the police on a daily basis and observe the Commanding Hour from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I'm proud of the team of Greece that fought until the last seconds."
Greece's head coach Fotis Cacicaris paid tribute to his team after a 1/4 match of the 2015 Eurobasket final with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by some mistakes.
“It was a great game,” Katsikaris said.
We were preparing for a great game in the performance of the Spaniards.
We tried to work in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: “I will be assigned the functions of Kaunas in the CSKA.”
CSKA novice Joel Freeland said he does not believe in the curse of the army.
He also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, myself, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sashi Kaunas, and I left the team, both in defense buildings and so on.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to relocate to the center position, but in the NBA I've played more forwards.
Now we’ll have to face more of the big central rival, but I’ve done it before, so I think, and I’ll do it now.
The team won the Euroleague for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but there they could not show their best basketball every time.
There's an opinion that someone has gleaned the team.
This is the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it’s difficult, I understand all the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we are going to show the best we are capable of, we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I have always wanted to win this title, the Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eye, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

It’s going to be a special game for me, but it doesn’t matter.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League from victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect from "Rome" the game she showed in series A against "Juventus".
It’s a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.

Despite the fact that the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - according to the official website of UEFA Kanyas. - We did not have enough courage in the attack.
Benfica is top of the class, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to pick up points.
It's quite real.
But first you have to think about Galatasaray and then Atletico.
In home games, we can pick up points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: “Repeat as many times as you like: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
Real head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with the big victory in the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to the forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of the three goals.

"Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players," the official website of UEFA De Rossi said.
With blue grenades it is difficult to play, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright individualities.
In order to leave them, we'll have to crawl through the game and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to wrapping, so we need to keep compact and organized.

The next match will be played against Slovenians.
I hope that I will come out in the next match in the starting line-up, - brings "R-Sport" words Yezhov.
I'm not an expert on goalkeepers, I'm a goalkeeper myself, we don't show repetitions of missed heads, so it's hard to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has a bad game.
The team still lost, though.
I would have missed more, but the team won.

Stephen Hogg used the girl's phone to force pedophiles to send photos
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, registered with the online messaging service, where he received a number of nasty images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, after which she immediately turned her mother’s attention to it.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at that address, and found "relevant" queries in the search engine using words to detect nasty images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did so because it could “attract pedophiles” and then he would “pretending to be a policeman to scare them off.”
Enforcement officer Eilid Robertson told the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said it was a passion, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had made requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to intimidate paedophiles.
He was questioned about a conversation with an unknown man who sent him pictures, and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, shook and cried.
She saw some nasty pictures on the phone, and then an eye bet was made with the accused.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused used a computer and Pleistocene to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the allegations of making indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, violating bail conditions on January 25 this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, filed an application not to include Hogg in the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it can be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, before receiving a letter from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody before the hearings on other remaining cases began.
It was included in the list of persons who committed crimes of a sexual nature before the date of the sentence.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is reading the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell from the staircase leading from the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash scene was instantly circulated on social media.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them of swindling Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they questioned the president during his address to the nation in parliament; this is exactly what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a member of the Democratic Change Movement, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
“The message came from a number that is not shown, but it is titled ‘Death,’” he told reporters at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
It warned the members of the parliament that inviolability would end in the parliament building, and as soon as they left, parliamentary inviolability would not work.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "worried" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service cost reduction program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two publicly traded companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
The deductions as a result of the projected job cut will amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“Such a restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will head the organization after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at the moment, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company was formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hullett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of large-scale reorganization in order to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a step by HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the industry, based on the confidence that narrowly specialized companies are working better.
Arsenal captain Michel Arteta says his team-mates should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's recovery went according to plan, nothing would stop him from returning to the game before Christmas.
With the most favourable development of the events, Wilshire will certainly miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most offensive thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently ended the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This is not related to the ankles or injuries that he had previously suffered.
It may be related things from a medical point of view, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injuries associated with it for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has only played in 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs that missed the most due to injuries of days.
Wenger acknowledges the likelihood of getting stuck in the wrong circle, but Arsenal believe that improvement in injury statistics in the final season will continue.
“Sometimes when you’re back in shape after an injury, you’re vulnerable for a while – during that time you need to recover strength and gain a competitive advantage,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to do it.
I hope that he will recover physically, I am confident in that, as well as in that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts a Champions League campaign on Wednesday with Dynamo-Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the team.
Ector Belerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting line-up will play Mattie Debussy and Arteta.
It is possible that Wenger would also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Giroux instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a little rest to those players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favourite in Group F, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is among the most impressive in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 games since they managed to hold last season as the Undefeated.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned a lesson from last season when the team suffered a defeat in the Champions League game from Monaco, and remains with a weak hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger said.
"Arsenal" has never done that.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I’m a realist with an internship.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A Comedy Show That Taught Us Serious Lessons in Men's Friendship
The lack of such stories is eye-opening, especially considering how desperate men’s need for honesty has become, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it became the only major cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it happens to men three times more often than it does to women.
In an attempt to understand the problem of the “Campaign Against Unfortunate Life” declared 2015 the Year of Men in order to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood", the chances of healing double.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the chances of developing mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it must be.
In an era when communications are managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often valued more than content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality loneliness reigns.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal aspirations for personal growth and friendship, which more strongly affects our soul health.
And, as one billionaire, the creator of video games, recently noticed, for money, you can not buy more happiness at all.
The advantage of friends is that they attract attention to this.
Each of the characters was determined not through their work, but rather through the person who manifested himself in communication with friends.
Joey's humour and Chandler's constant hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's respirations by Rachel - all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully studying their feelings.
As the Samaritans employee told me: “...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal moods emphasizes how even the slightest communication with friends can benefit.”
Often those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old teaching “lives with it” strongly, as well as the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-lasting overcoming mechanisms.
It underlined the inconspicuous moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger who talks on the phone helps people in moments of despair, while long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday you have completely restored the decorations, why not take your friends to a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say "Hello".
I don’t know what the benefit of friendship can be.

Di Maria scores goal by helping PSG defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Mathuide and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored in the Malmö goal.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily bypass Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's a report on the match and the reaction of the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at Park de Prénce on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after starting his first Champions League game as a PSG player to give direction to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their lead when Cavani scored it.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, Pari had to make a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, as they aimed not at qualifying for the playoffs, but at continuing the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they have been until the end of the season.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against the team from his hometown and the club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so winning with a 2-0 account, giving the opponents problems and playing well in the defense is a good start, even if there are other moments that we’ll need to work out during the season,” Blan said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the replacements in the Paris team, which brought her to zero with a 2:2 in the game against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but was pushed to the back of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was marked as a player capable of bringing PSG to a new level in Europe after he was bought back from Manchester United last month, and he proved why he left the midfield when he escaped from Davos after a pass from Marco Verratti behind the defences of Malmo.
However, if someone then expected an easy and big victory from the PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, with nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of the blow of Nikola Giurgi<0xC4><0x87>, in which the ball flew past the long bar of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
However, PSG sometimes succumbed to unsuccessful transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half could not make at least five attempts, and then could not process the ball, scored by Kavani immediately after the restart of the game.
However, he showed himself to be much more skilled in precise passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who, Di Maria sent the ball with a screwed-up punch, which passed a stick past Vilanda for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Kavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic spiked the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only Willand's interception of the ball from a close distance did not allow David Louis to increase the final score before the replacement Esquel Lavessi was not counted in the goal itself.
Malme's coach Age Haraide later admitted that PSG were a class higher than his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
We've only played in the Swedish league ever since, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Pair"!
It was a great match with them.

The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think this is a sign of the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also come to the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates participated in his work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work is also indicated by the fact that a meeting of a permanent seminar was held in Tyumen at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of the APK of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of the Belarusians in the training of personnel for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the field of agrochemicals.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev talked about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of supplies of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be affected – they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end consumer.
Problems in the work of the Tumenian trading house "Belshin" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring profit to the region.
We talked about the further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of MAZ JSC, the development of the service center of MAZ JSC, which was established in Tyumen on the basis of TPATP JSC.
The conversation also touched on the preparation of the region’s working delegation’s trip to the Republic of Belarus until the end of this year.
Another topic of the discussion was the conclusion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific and technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen Region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to go to a new level.
These issues also concern the regional centre.
During a meeting with the head of the city administration of Tyumen Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tumenian bus park.
About 100 buses are already “breathing on the ladan”, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will run on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products of Mogilevliftmash JSC, receiving components.
In my view, this activity could be more active given the programs to install new lifts in the regional center.
I should add that within the extended powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increased turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaurale was discussed.
A meeting with the governor of Oman is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a hub for revitalizing many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul-General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
Under the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the task, while continuing to work on the prospect.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking.
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that it is not necessary to take into account ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of the show Project Greenlight on HBO, a well-known actor beat Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
“Purple is appropriate when you’re casting for the film itself, not the show,” Damon said.
Disgraced Brown, not believing her ears, shouted insultingly "Oh! Nothing to herself. Well-well" all the time, while the actor from "Marcianina" made comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers joined Damon and Brown.
“I would like participants – no matter who will be the director – to think about what interpretations of the image of Harmony they are going to adhere to,” Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white suitor.
The producer of the film Dear White People advocated for the film to be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "in the end we can get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry about what was shown in the video: “The explanation of the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room is SO BLACK that it hurts so much.”
Twitter has garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s remarks appear just when the competent coverage of the racial issue in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public discussion.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the black population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned the move during the nomination of the nominees for "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group will be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the movement's leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media magnets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" Awarded First Champion
Professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldero on Monday evening became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the prize of $1 million.
On this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have yet managed to pass all stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final of the season, two participants - Caldhiero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included climbing the 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and bet at the specified time, becoming the first athlete in the history of the American Ninja Warrior, having passed the exhausting stage 4, but Caldero managed the task for as much as three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After winning with incredible effort, Caldero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
“To think about it is incredible, I’ve never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told reporters at E!, a major jump in his income.
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined what it would be like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wid met with reporters at The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, would not receive any cash prizes.
According to the rules, the money gets the fastest participant.
"If there are more than one final players, the prize is the fastest of them," Wid said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, it still gets a huge satisfaction.
I don't think he's offended by that.
He's happy with what he's done.
He received tons of enthusiastic feedback from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was destined to lose to someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Tigers' Child Quietly Walks The Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS – The second half of the season wasn’t particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now hold the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a hindrance, the Tigers won the Minnesota Twins with a 5–4 win on Tuesday at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut back on the half-game behind Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which escaped them for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they get," Tigers manager Brad Osmus said.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution to supporting the attacks, resulting in Detroit scoring three points in the first two innings, then adding another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality start in nine releases.
“I just want to end the year with good performances,” Simon said.
Pitchers can’t be substituted in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Appointed Tigers rebounder Victor Martinez managed to repel three hits and scored two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day of three strikes since a four-stroke game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He did a good job beating,” Osmus said.
He showed himself well in (the quality of the batter), noticeably better in the work of the beat and kept this quality for the game.
Having scored three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance of getting back in the game.
Central receiver Byron Baxton opened the inning with a doble on the left line of the field.
Reithfielder Aaron Hicks, making a ban, took the first base, and the second bassman Brian Dozier got a strike-out from Simon before his place was taken by left-wing Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moore, the only player on the road, before newly appointed rebounder Miguel Sano, who knocked out a two-run "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Vergagen.
With a pair of injuries not in the car and a comparative injury on the second base, VerHagen managed to lead the third bassman Trevor Pluff to a relegation in double play.
It was the 27th time for the top league player this season when Pluff kicked the ball into double play.
After Detroit added a sub-insurance injury in the first half of the ninth inning, Moore earned the RBI a "double" in the space between outfielders against the closing pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikes and got his fifth seed.
Detroit took advantage of the temporary non-practitioner Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the pre-game injury list, missing more than a month due to a spinal inflammation.
“It’s definitely not the start I’d like,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to make a few pretty good throws in the third inning.”
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes dropped the single to second bassist Ian Kinsler.
Wook with two straightfielder J.D. Martines took out Victor Martines, who made the single in the middle for the first injury in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with the runners in the resulting position.
Third base player Nick Castellianos followed up with a "single", bringing another injury, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased their account in the second inning, receiving a one-way double from Catcher James McCann and a two-way single from central rebounder Anthony Goose, and it was 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn’t do very well, but he got right to the right spot.
Hughes, whose throws were considered to have been thrown in an unattached third inning, after which he was replaced by a right-handed relayer A.J. Ahter.
Hughes had three hits on six hits and four strikeouts.
NOTE: Pitcher-right "Tigers" Anibal S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez came out of the players due to the right shoulder extension.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez undergoing shoulder surgery back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to leave early Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, left-wing pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go out against the Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-hander David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in the games since August 20 due to stretching of the muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series on the Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play right-handed Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Pray to God" came to the South Sahalin court.
In the South Sahalinsky City Court received the original appeal of the representative of Chechnya President Ramzan Kadyrov for the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Pray to God: its meaning and place in Islam".
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the proceedings.
Chuchray declined to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the mayor's office for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
“They’re talking about that kind of nonsense,” he said.
On September 11, the South Sahalin City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko’s decision to recognize the book as an “extremist material”.
An appeal was filed by the Prosecutor’s Office of South Sahalinska on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they have asked the court to recognize only the opinion of the author of this book as extremist, and not the Quranic verses.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chuchrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremists" were called quotations from the Qur'an - "We worship You and ask You for help", "So call no one besides Allah."
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book "Satans and provocateurs".
He called on the Deputies of the State Duma to legislatively prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of the sacred scriptures.
“I am firmly convinced that the Duma must adopt a law under which it is forbidden to make judicial decisions directly concerning the texts of the Qur’an and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram post.
Facebook to remove comments that offend migrants and refugees <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Facebook’s employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative rating to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism on the network, the Facebook leadership was found together with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, the head of the department, Haiko Maas, said that at the moment the ministry is working together with the specialists of the social network to create a special group of moderators.
Its participants have a duty to track and remove incorrect comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Hiko Maas, the authors of the intolerant posts are expected to receive notifications stating the reason for their deletion.
Organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network for offensive posts should also contribute to the operative blocking of illegal content.
“Facebook’s leadership intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative remarks to migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice, was made after a sharp rise in xenophobic sentiments in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them has been the unprecedented migration crisis on a scale that spanned the countries of the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all the places destined for refugee accommodation are already overcrowded.
On the eve of the country authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
Forced immigrants from the countries of the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In the cemeteries of Moscow there will be areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several of the capital’s cemeteries are equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Butovskoe, Domodedovskoe, and Shcherbin Cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared at Troekurov Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such areas will appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Yekimov, who is the head of the State Budgetary Institution "Ritual".
The relaxation zones will be small green areas, reminiscent of parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors of the cemetery will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedovsky, Butovsky and Shcherbinsky cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forests to the maximum extent possible.
The green plantations will serve as a living fence that will divide the resting areas and the areas placed directly under the burial sites.
The experts of GBU "Ritual" also stated their intention to make a proposal to refuse the fences at the funerals.
The new cemeteries can become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" was told about the readiness to engage in the installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to the cemetery will be able to know the GPS coordinates and the number signs of the burials.
In June of this year, GBU Ritual also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of the year.
So, digging a grave in the summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 per cent.
In the forests of Elenin, five days later, a missing mushroom was found.
The old man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
It was possible to find the mountain mushroom thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Aleksandr Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cinematographers with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter was connected to the search jobs.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, as usual, went to the forest after the opiums and underwaters, but did not return to the evening.
The relatives immediately sought help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighbouring village - only about 30 people - were raised in search of the mushroom.
On the fifth day, the helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the fire and rescue department of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was pulled, the man was found."
It went a long way, in a completely different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He went a great distance at his age.
Miracle remained alive.
The fungus was transported to the central district hospital of Elenin without consciousness, in an extremely severe condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and undercooling of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the woods, doctors have absolutely no idea.
Valentina Nep<0xC5><0xA1>a, Head of the Therapeutic Department of the Elena CRB: "Patient examination, treatment is appointed."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
In view of all his chronic illnesses.
The condition of the patient in the morning improved, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Retired Vitaly Aleksandrovich comes to Smolensk from Tambov region every year.
His grandson says his grandfather had gone to collect mushrooms before, but he never went deep into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, itself is not in principle local."
I've been visiting for a few years, visiting relatives.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
Apparently, he went far and got lost.
With the beginning of the fungal season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
There have been five similar cases in the last few days.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, snacks and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave behind traces so that you can then go back.
The An-2 crashed on average in a fraternal tide.
In Siberia, an emergency An-2 was built on average.
The emergency landing of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Enisey" took place 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no casualties and no casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage upon landing.
The An-2 made an official flight.
There were three crew members on board – the commander, the second pilot and the mechanic on board, Interfax reports.
The emergency plane made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsk-Acinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Brother Transport Prosecutor’s Office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began to check compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s Office has gone to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed their aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned Taj airfield in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics were refused on the liner, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board the plane.
No one was injured in the plane's emergency landing.
News Economics <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel laureate: Globalization
The process of globalization should have helped to reduce inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in income of the population in the developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Muskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to the chief researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-Choosing of the NIU HSE, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics Erik Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
The trade borders between the two countries have become more and more open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted great benefits for developing economies.
“These predictions have come true in many ways,” Muskin said.
For example, China and India have seen a significant increase in GDP per capita.
However, not all is so joyful.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the “poor” and the “unpoor” in poor countries, which manifests itself in large income inequality, or rather in wages.
But in reality, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why global markets have not reduced inequality in emerging economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by NIE BSE.
Together with economist Michael Kremer, a professor at Harvard University, Eric Muskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization grows, according to NIE WSE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin sets out four levels of professional qualifications – A and B for rich countries, C and D – for poor countries.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualifications to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries have a higher salary thanks to cooperation with B-level employees from the rich, then D-level workers do not feel growth or their salaries are falling at all.
The resulting effect is that internationalization of production will contribute to increasing the pay gap between the two categories of specialists in poor countries and, accordingly, to increasing the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed an astonishingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It makes it possible to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, - says Fuad Alesserov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions, head of the Department of Mathematics of the University of Economics.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a burst of empirical work in this field.
According to Eric Maskin, the solution to the problem is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the funds for this, and companies are not profitable to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, Muskin said.
The scientist notes that the theory developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought about and is bearing fruit in the form of the growth of countries’ GDP.
Darkent: a living connection of times.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
In the program of festive events - the festival of the national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and the fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbants carpets and the Day of the Open Temples, the historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Petrov.
Medieval stones of the Narin-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow alleys and palace gardens - all as if coming from the pages of "Thousands and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Kaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the Oriental Platans, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - Monuments of Living Nature".
The shadow of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque is poured with aromatic tea and will be greeted with Dagestan delicacies - honeycomb, lobster, mushmulla, miracle mushrooms, iran and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, large samovars have been used to drink tea from numerous guests at one time.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in the year 115 of the hijra.
That is, in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking with scale and solemnity: arcades of domes and arches are based on square columns and illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Owners of birds put dolphins in the yards, under trees, on the attic.
An exciting sight is the rise in the sky of a room of white pigeons, similar to the outbreaks of a festive fireworks.
In defense of the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
Leaving for 500 meters in the sea, this building blocked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best-preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortification building.
Carpets in Derbent were woven back in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste - stripes of wool, cotton or yarn of all colors and shades, with ore and without it, with a complex ornament and strange quince.
The construction of the city began with mounds - quarters with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the bees have hardly changed.
Only satellite plates, air-conditioning on the walls and streetlights remind you that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the waterway, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago, have been preserved.
Until our days, ancient sources have reached, in which the locals still collect water today.
Many derbants prefer ordinary water from taps to water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of the pottery trade.
Irrigation and paint vases, dishes, cans, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the gonchars are now making wonderful ceramics for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the days of holidays and festivals, a crowd of spectators gather under a tense rope, on which the students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of astonishing and risky craftsmanship spans several centuries.
A new trend - among the rowers you can see girls more and more often.
In the room of the former Virgin Bath, today there is a museum "Culture and the Life of Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here in the company of girlfriends, and now anyone can see the sumptuous dome hall, hot and cold pools that have gone into the past belongings for swimming.
Most houses in Derbent have hot water, but baths and steam baths are as popular these days as they used to be.
About the benefits of heating the body steam is written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and ease.
At the festival "Society", which takes place on the territory of the fortress of Narin-Kala, ethnic courts of many districts of Dagestan participate.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform the songs of the Caucasian peoples and welcome visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who turned their heads over to Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The jewelled sarcophagi are cut from solid stone blocks and oriented, as is the case with the Arabs, on the west-east axis.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Yakubova knit and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser has been in this place for many years.
The practices of circular crafts are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the brothers of Yakubova can do not only the traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, a house was preserved, in which lived the Caucasus-born writer-decabrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting ethnographic material, he described the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, the life and life of the townspeople.
The Teakhana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, to chat with friends and to solve some work-related problems.
As in the past, it is not recommended for women to cross the threshold of the chickpeas.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspy" was created three years ago, but has already managed to participate in events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, teaching in perfection the folk Avar, Dargin, Tata, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise fades and the streetlights are lit, locals settle on the benches near the houses with terraces.
As a rule, derbents discuss household issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they are more and more recalling the episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo there was a business "game at the airport".
A new form of education is being developed in the capital.
Four hundred students tested themselves in the role of airport staff.
For this purpose, models of three aircraft were assembled in Domodedovo.
The young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served the aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it has not given up on reality.
Delayed flights, immediately two passengers with fractures on board, the trap was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
It's hell for the airport.
For the one that was based in the Domodedov hangar - a standard set of tasks that beginners have to solve.
Three major airports from different countries of the world were accommodated in one hangar.
They currently employ four hundred students from colleges and universities in the capital.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the inner world of aviagavani.
Check-in of passengers, aircraft service, turnover of luggage - they were entrusted even the buses on the summer field, stairs and inspection of passengers.
And the passengers are quite problematic.
One had a mess with the documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in a minimum of time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount of virtual cash, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for the service of the flight.
“They are being fined for failing to perform the relevant tasks,” financial analyst Dmitry Hilko explained in an interview with the News-Moscow program.
The incident is closely monitored by officials from the Ministry of Education.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She has already found her place in secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional competence centres will be formed, which will be, in essence, new models of the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs", - says the director of the department of state policy in the field.
But students are not on global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a weekend.
But the assessments for this exam had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding in a timely manner to a complaint to our airport on Instagram," said the game's participant Sergei Shuvalov, the team's pier manager at Frankfurt Airport.

The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia has expressed its regret at the closure of the U.S. Center’s foreign literature library.
The center has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the U.S. Embassy Center at the All-Russian State Library of M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the relations between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the U.S.'s long history of relations."
The American Center has established deep and strong links between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place with numerous prominent American figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians, and writers.
“Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another Russian-American joint project – the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to dissolve.
Typical situation: Four officials stand at the table of Judge Swantaner Kumar, hearing his claims about the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you a 110-page order so that you may rejoice over it,” Kumar said.
If at least one more brick is laid, we will order to remove all existing buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judiciary body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal was able to consider more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: in less than 60 years since the declaration of the independence of industrial development, India has turned from a country of the virgin jungle into one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
Particularly acute is the problem in large metropolises, where the development of infrastructure does not follow the rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste snails of enterprises and households.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, the NZT is regularly criticized by Narendra Modi’s government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May of this year, the environment minister called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “unenforceable”.
Sometimes it is really impossible to enforce the court’s decisions within the time limit set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjvani.
However, unfulfilled deadlines also have a positive side: at least they make the responsible persons move.
“His main goal is to shake up this system,” the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled large constructions: at its expense, the construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller buildings.
At the same time, people are also trying to remember: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single pencil.
So, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and a plethora of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi government with statistics on inbound and outbound road transport, and also offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, after knowing in advance at factories whether they were able to carry out such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to fall into the attention of the courts, the anger of the people began to calm down a bit.
But the most painful theme of the principle judge was the program to clean the Ganges, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges - a river sacred to the Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and goes on to scream.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of the Ganga on the statue of God, and it contained feces, - the judge is hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think: Ganges are Ganges, he will take away all our sins.
This is a river that we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The Ganges Cleanup is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of faecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Hindus bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganga Rescue Fund from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India must go a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be ecology.
“In a developing country, environmental conversations are often perceived as unacceptable luxury,” said Malika Bhanot, an activist at Call Ganga.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle ground between ecology and development.”

Xi Jinping urges to make the economy more open to the world
The economy needs to become more open to the world to boost its growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to a group facing the task of leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group on Comprehensive Deepening Reforms.
According to him, expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide new space for economic development.
The Leading Group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulation of investor access to the market, changes to the rules of border control, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE), attracting private capital and the revision of the system of registration of residents.
According to the statement, a list of economic and manufacturing sectors not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually decommissioned through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, ensuring business law and increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control over the powers it has given to companies, ensuring that companies will run their own business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of the state-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
In addition, the procedure for applying for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or "green card", will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
The meeting also discussed the protection of the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Ketian and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
