The Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "looking muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his group was concerned "that it would stay with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means cocoa.
A member of the Welsh Party Assembly said his entire group was "dissatisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales claimed his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the MWP pronunciation jump to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the designation of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the members themselves".
The Welsh Government’s 2017 law gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, which revealed broad support for calling the Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option gained most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could lead to Assembly President Elin Jones, who should submit the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on the question of how they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country’s name will be changed to “the Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price you have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Bells Keep Silenced by the Difficulties of Harlem Churches
“Historically, the older people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that the neighbors regularly go to.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the starting point."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who will not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation of worshipers acquired the building.
A black congregation took over St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged, and while Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the railroad.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the railroad expert called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first lane in the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play the larger lane of Riverside Church, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "attempted to pass the costs" to the board, although the diocese had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the diocese’s lack of transparency.
Shark Hurts 13-Year-Old Diving in California for Lobster
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving in search of lobsters in California on the day the lobster season opened, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realized that "he was screaming that they had been bitten by him.
, , ,
He had his clavicle broken,” Hammel observed as he approached the child.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad, to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2800 trillion and with growth going up compared to the drop in fashion sales and home furnishings, the largest beauty aisles come to be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if you have it more successfully.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and home furnishings.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first newly opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift toward daily buying small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, has said the stores will look more and more like shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to combat Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is thought to have boosted grocery sales and further profitable these acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide revenue from pharmacy outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical establishments to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our aisles in a way that enhances the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and an attractive environment and comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is “angry” after Holly Willoughby breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby broke an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the truly fashion brand and accessories.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by leaving her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "angry" when the television gold girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m, would not leave time to devote to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby’s fortune, of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his vacation homes.
As one source consulted commented: “Truely was, by contrast, Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all those involved completely impaired.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow’s headquarters, ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and for ten years they have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity show on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones said last night "there was no talk of business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider “unpresidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up on so many things?
Trump commented with his blatant voice of “news presenter.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in reuniting with him after Trump praised the first meeting held in Singapore in June, which he considered a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations for denuclearization, however, have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the U.S. to the first steps for North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s outlook was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help to release hostages and bring the dead bodies of U.S. soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach by talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but so instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” explains Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are not yet sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling from one island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and has spent enough money on roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face the pressure of Indonesia’s persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 yards from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second pole.
The action drove him over the area and headed to the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to put myself in that position to get me into the ball and players like Shaq always play very far ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midpointer made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning by scoring near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass to the space that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and ended up throwing the ball into the second pole net with a kick with his left foot that Liverpool’s Alisson Becker couldn’t stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage. The match will be held at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the debris of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, according to the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man as murder suspect after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, which resulted in the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but it would encourage anyone who was near John Street, in Birkenhead, to have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to pick up something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe they know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him that no one can enter or exit the building.
He was surprised when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to enter again in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
I keep saying "it's terrible."
At two in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cord by controlling the block of floors.
Anyone who has information is asked to send an email to DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success for "rewriting history"
His ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "insanity" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that taking out the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
Cromwell’s magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century view and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If it is a totally accurate description it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Killing Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a cattleman in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and covered with blood near a well of Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines to pigs from a well in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby well was open.
He said that in the well there was a big pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the cattle to the death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and broken,” the cousin, who is addressed by his surname, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence on the spot.
It appears that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, it is not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 295 kilograms hung a farmer on his tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After, in 2012, pigs were eaten by an Oregon rancher, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rains widespread in the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rain throughout northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused winds of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday to 5:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean are starting to generate low pressures, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to drive intense tropical rains south-east to the U.S. Northeast.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain hits the low pressure that is approaching, there will be heavy widespread precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows, and possible landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical rains will cause precipitation of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions may occur.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not at all recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into crumbling rivers and storms will cause cracked winds and clouds of dust locally.
The low pressures that are approaching will leave heavy rains on specific parts of the southern California coast.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of debris and make roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrons will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before rain is widespread at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be some intense temperature changes in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and re-expand.
In much of central and eastern U.S., a warm early October is expected, with widespread temperatures around 26 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures of up to 26 degrees could be reached in New York, about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high above-average temperatures for the east of the U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the appearance of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed the tearing testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, gave Thursday on six television channels.
Meanwhile, the policy was still at a dead end and the media interrupted its usual schedule to relay Friday's latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunken state and that he tried to take her out of his clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that hadn’t happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playoffs or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s designation, fuels the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras caught how protesters shouted at him as he tried to climb into an elevator to attend a court appearance.
While receiving these accusations, rebroadcast live by CNN, he was shot down.
“Looking at my face,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would count more on his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and radio broadcasters broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate to vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the accusations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it became clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘making politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside him on the cover of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers’ alleged plan for Brexit, stating that one proposal for Britain and the EU to collect the other’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for a second-degree homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to having shot Wayde.
A security deposit of $350,000 has been established, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Court of Instruction released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of the death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police forces for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said his team was “devastated” and “in shock” by Wayde’s death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering vehicle windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity on the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters faced anti-disturbances as thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coincided with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been hit by riots threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually packed with tourists.
Conflicts also occurred in later hours and police used pawns to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages such as "neither forget nor forgiveness", faced Unionist protesters shouting "Viva Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region a year after the vote on October 1, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although participation was low, as people opposed to secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to block voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
The independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to hold back the momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting further trial for their role in the organization’s referendum.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for ingesting a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ingesting a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 19:30 at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, you may have shot the car with a ballast.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by earning the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as an Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, with Gary Holt's taking one place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, the Gerrards have not yet achieved any home wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points ahead.
Earlier, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston is expanding its winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, head coach, has yet to taste the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets pass opportunities in front of a strong visitor
Holt's team had to go a step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the goal, after Alan Lithgow got the deflected shot after boarding to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the goal.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems to visitors with the stop-ball play.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined move from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but could not pass the host's defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers goalkeeper, rejected a shot from Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another move from Livingston.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entered, but they were always cleared, and two penalty requests were rejected, one after Halkett's entry over substitute Glenn Middleton and one by one hand.
"Phenomenal" of Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and crew have barely experienced changes since his ascension, but this is largely due to Holt’s way of reinforcing the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team’s captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they stayed short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a call of attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there was a smile and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers personified in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by paramedics, but died there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran off on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured After Disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a men's high-security prison, according to the Penitentiary Center Directorate.
The riots began at the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday and continue.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight interns participate and which affect a pavilion.
Officers were assisted for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: “A specialised prison staff has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received medical care for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and they could spend more time between bars.”
Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had received hospital medical care after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbance agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dry areas could benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last collections of Hurricane Rosa crossed the southwest of the desert, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their tropical storm or depression state within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n Shoe in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rose’s rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to drought conditions currently experiencing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s itinerary will hit the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have a hurricane force on Sunday morning with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and travels north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to recalibrate in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"Torrent rains of between 7 and 15 centimetres from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora are expected, with a chance of reaching 25 centimetres," according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then moving through Arizona to the south of Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or its remains is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and southwest of the U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden flooding and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the messyness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Voting in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the messyness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about this indictment.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, the "Americans saw the cunning, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most accomplished jurists of our day, a jurist with an admirable history at the service of the public,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“There are five weeks left for one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not presenting myself, but it's a race," he said.
“That’s why I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump claimed the Democrats are embarked on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure goes up
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When yesterday was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and didn’t flee immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB).
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it rocked everything on land," Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s big earthquake was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the demolished buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the 300 km coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, you hear a man who was on the top floor of a building alerting people who were on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami triggered a major outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but people evacuated still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
While World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under canvases installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while aid groups were putting in place the gears of disaster assistance, some people complained that it was not allowed to move to Palu by experienced cooperators.
According to Indonesian legislation, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it has not yet happened.”
Falling the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the devastating stories that natural disasters are writing.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that same month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
“For my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM recharge in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole a Brink employee charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, carrying $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came up running after Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for recharging.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will begin to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person previously known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious importance to him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he talked about the title of the album with radio talker Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper-case or lower-case letters, with or without a script.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, Mexican president-elect, has promised never to use the military against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the military to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining ground throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and I.A. professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after I.A. announcements from several parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 innovation in IA by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are going far behind the U.S. We have a look at the next breakthrough in the I.A. field,” Lee says.
Double funding means double the chances of the next big I.A. achievement being achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton publisher Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading I.A. companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat the best American Othello player. Later, he was executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee awarded recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next, which would allow identifying the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee commented that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think I.A. doctors should automatically have permanent residence cards," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name would be changed to “the Republic of North Macedonia,” a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for everyone,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported at one of the afternoons.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko deposited their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a name change of the country that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up very high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says membership in NATO would contribute to the investment Macedonia needs so much, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than required.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
In case it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero avoids the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling regained Brighton's defense in the 2-0 win Manchester City won on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a midfield pass at the start of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Once there, he was seen surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He skipped a defense before outscoring several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a left pass, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League contention.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that move, Agüero received the ball very much within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The frontman of the Sky blues threw the ball into the net just before he got out of bounds.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to give the Rockies a party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to climb the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they, having won against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard place thanks to a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursue their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can step on the tyre with the certainty that the Denver audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t you want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to let Scherzer launch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, made a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hand record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the most important ones. I don’t present myself, but it’s a race, so I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates,” he said.
And he went on: “We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, there is messy, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to pass over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“We’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were angry, they were bad, horrible and fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the abuses from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Are you filtering the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of opinions.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was barely surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Members of the Labour Party Parliament who are told that they are not welcome, and only to say what we think.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received treatment that seems to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe, and it is ironic that they were issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a “more kind and kind” policy is already more than forgotten, if indeed it was applied at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every "censorship" motion or every change in selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that advised me to keep my head down and not make me hear so much and so “it would be okay.”
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need it most, either as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to ignore my political stances or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my fidelity to the leader of the Labour Party when the country heads to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting on what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final result, but, without a doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining match of Tennent's Premiership day.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team out of the ten to take part.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better exploit the opportunities, which gave the local team the victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in every game and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggott became a no-go.
Climo extended the Ayr's lead with a penalty. Before, just in the middle, he scored and converted a solo rehearsal, which left the score at 17-5 in favor of the Ayr in the rest.
However, the Melrose started well in the second part and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, whom they had to pull off on a stretcher, and, as the game resumed, the Ayr advanced with a rehearsal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of another man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placating Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a rehearsal when he was on the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent the wing Gregor Henry to the background to do the fifth rehearsal of the locals.
Still Game Protagonist Wants to Orient His Career Towards the Restoration Sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant industry after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the BBC’s famous show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registration, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, though a source from the Scottish Sun said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flowing catering market."
"The sea belongs to us": a coastless Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors are guarding a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are marine blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the nineteenth century, in addition to the desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will vote in favour of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is fighting a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have stifled it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if he can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear matters paralyzed more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subjugate the North is a “chimera.”
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament move before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness of relinquishing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric large hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the walkway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the walkway.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing decorated with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large accessories were watermelons with jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation resembled a complete diving equipment, snorkeling and sunglasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big-sized fashion, you're in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could start to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats come in handy from "The Bomb", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this hat so impractical that flooded social media presented another great creation on the walkway: a straw beach bag as big as the model in bathing suit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia flakes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of Jacquemus’ La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent educational centres have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary exam results that is reinforced by individual and collective successes harvested in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centers, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent colleges aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, it is noted that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in centers.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, he reaches to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest approval rates in independent colleges.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that are part of SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them as a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills revealed that 17 % of the reasons for employers’ difficulties in covering jobs were attributable to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities that require languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation. It was also found that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If they know several languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this matter.
Scotland’s independent educational centres dedicate all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted in a tweet that James was likely to play for a few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled rallies for next week, including stops in places with supporters such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his candidate to cover the pending Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have left an early Senate confirmation vote waiting for at least a week while the FBI is investigating them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections take momentum.
President Trump’s campaign noted that next week’s five rallies aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to give his name told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena tonight's rally could attract fans of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that it dares to fight to keep hope alive for Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating thrust pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They took us six points and now they take four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in favor and reason to be excited, among other reasons for the Spieth and Justin Thomas pair, who played together all day and scored three out of four points each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The festive guttural screams rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to hit the fourth game when he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match on the 15th was received with a similar cry, from those who broadcast that believe that the American team has not yet been left out.
"What needs to be done is to redouble efforts and focus on the party," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe wears four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoons, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and in the last nine holes of Friday mornings.
That streak and the way his energy flows with the crowd makes it clear that these are the players that must be defeated on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four balls, after forming a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and those they don’t, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big advantage over the last day, but this foursome also demonstrated that the U.S. team dares to fight, something some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe advances by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe set off with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods in trouble, ahead of four points in the Le Golf National ranking.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to score eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat a disenchanted Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a 5-4 round.
Woods, who had not excelled too much in Saturday’s two games, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes games, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, reverted to Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was nice and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its part.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored an exciting 2-1 win over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two opening holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as a trophy owner, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says there is "no chance" that they will disarm first unilaterally if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of its country relinquishing nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the International Organization’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling facilities for nuclear tests and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we have not received any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances, there’s no way we can disarm unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it steps in step by step, his statement is important, as he did not simply reject a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the “nuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should relinquish its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, even by putting objections to a declaration of war termination,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the U.S. leader to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, over the past five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in a stagnation.”
Even so, Ri’s tone of speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles to U.S. soil after the “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim a “missile man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we realize the definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea denounced that its "requirements were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing masculine culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that the number one university students in the world usually have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
Their motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached me and asked me why she just learned about this now, in her final year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were barely sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change the behavior of the students right away.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He claimed that the culture of pride for “sleeping the night on candles” still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
He expects the next step to be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is for students to think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitting the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter the rhythms that would paradoxically end up having problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's Goal Tomb to Gerrard's Men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to get their first away win since the February 4-1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, blunt leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred minutes before half-time and the Rangers' uninspired alignment was not up to date at any time.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third, behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may be in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head wound after someone allegedly threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the champions who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt took out the 11 Livingston players who kicked a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his very organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored two minutes from the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs drew a deep foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he was penalized in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two goals in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's boring launch.
Although the 34th minute goal scored by Livingston came against every prognosis, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t cope with Jacobs’s deep stop-ball move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head corner that didn't come in.
The Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty at the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page in the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger accountant, who has since been a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronation", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and re-inject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires a patient to extract immune cells and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

Kanye West was booed in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to depose against the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and I wonder how I might like Trump if he’s a racist.
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the sketch program of Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not rebroadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's bronca to social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that he had gone wrong behind the scenes for wearing that cap.
"They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with the cap on.
They got into me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how asleep I am?” and added that he “goes to put on his superman coat, because that meant that no one could tell him what he had to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments were booed by the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety, one person told the magazine: "The studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West disconcerted many when he went out on stage to sing I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR resisting the MUCHEDUMBRE."
Karen Hunter, a host of an interview show, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He is free.
We too,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.

A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an eastern Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Game of Thrones star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying those on-screen roles often transmitted to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that she believes "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her roommate in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she thought it was "quite important" to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it’s pretty important right now, where have we been wrong about masculinity?”
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television may have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its such masculine characters.
And he continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel they have to be this particular form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change that?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that he is “hard of battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he has ever gotten out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, it has given me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at a family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, Chinese health authorities said at a congress in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBTQ group suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a member of her staff leaking data from Republican Senators and claims they are “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were driven by commentators and "extreme-right" websites.
“Lies, lies, and more vile lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
Allegedly, the published information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel regarding allegations of sexual misconduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak was made sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Dismiss this information in anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that not the temperament needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the motives of the accused.
It must maintain calm and serenity.”
It seems Fleischer wanted to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to ban Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations."
“We will make sure that the authors are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review: Back in Action: Rowan Atkinson’s Spy Parody Is Short
Now it has become a tradition to look for clues to Brexit in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is exactly what to do with this new installment of the parody action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this self-satisfying irony about how clearly fucked up we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his jumping eyes and his expressionless face, has renewed his license to get in the foot for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to throw away glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that played a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his origins were based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good moments.
I loved to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers collided against the helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy jumps in the eye, but the humor remains rather short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comical ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s absurd misadventures are not as ingenious and successful as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents in the face of the consternation of the in-service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and horny character who’s watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character that’s almost like Theresa May, but the script leaves little room for work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That's got to be the torpedo Johnny English, who now teaches in a lazy school, although he gives unofficial classes on how to be a secret agent: there's some good jokes, as it's a rock school-like espionage academy.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his suffering former buddy Bough, once again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taken advantage of enough.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash the chaos hiding in Volta’s luxurious yacht; and English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the interior of Volta’s house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in that last sequence, but, as funny and scary as it may be, the ensemble continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do real justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to allocate the savings made thanks to the AI revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea “would fit” into the party’s plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favor of workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received the support of the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: An announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and is not going to be discussed at this time.”
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was willing to regain powers of “anonymous” and “exploited” directors from companies that provide public services.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that current shareholders of water companies do not regain their full share, as a labor government could apply deductions that correspond to the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds where 10 percent of private sector companies’ shares are to be allocated to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in '60 Minutes' about the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for confirmation as a Supreme Court magistrate for at least a week and also raises the question of whether the findings could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring to light information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation would come out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, determined, sharp.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the indictment,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett sharply denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive poster of stars gathers for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal: to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free event ticket (unless you can pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteers, email a world leader, make a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the 12-year-old Global Citizen achieved to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clickivism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have managed world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.250 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, from which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and contractors united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with their full potential". To this end, Globali partners have been proposed to provide Rwanda $35 million to help Ci.00s after the country's most malnutrition tweets.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, told the crowd during an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also claimed that, after carrying out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
One Global Citizen contributor responded, “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights movements and the anti-apartheid movement have achieved in the past, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russia's energy exports - Interior Ministry
“If necessary,” Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
“I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they are doing with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that the seaways remain open and, if the case is made, could even block them to ensure that the energy doesn’t end up in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to harness and replace fuels,” he warned, while pointing out that Russia knows only one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and reclaim either function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project responds only to economic motives and is a more sign of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after holding a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow last September.
The U.S. position has, however, met with Germany’s rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has asked the U.S. not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) said after a meeting recently between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look closely at the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Council, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally have women among the leaders,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running as a presidential candidate.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance in the City Hall and said he was “bringing the country on the wrong path.”
“I’m really worried about the harm Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke unequivocally about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said it was "absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should be running for the 2020 election.
58 percent of "possible" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not appear, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% of respondents did, however, support their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the previous governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation my son is going through, because of everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return with,” he told the audience who gathered at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo nobody wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect for what his fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all other members of the army have given up."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a denunciation of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 States, D.C. Support the Challenge of Achieving a New Asylum Policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a court appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a “friendly” letter in Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum seeker who faces the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name has not been revealed in the "Grace v. Sessions" case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Migratory Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in the country.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made a statement Friday in which he said the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
“Under federal law, all applications for asylum must fail under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” it says in the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also stated in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and "requires a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin for persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said when announcing this directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced by people around the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her baby with fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search out among the few drowned belongings left in an effort to recover as much as possible.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and a broken shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the continuous, also very strong, replicas.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the wall that fell, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, and he and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congress elections, something China denies emphatically.
Trump’s indictment of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials referred to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels on imports on both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that were applied at the start of the trade war were thought to fall back on exporters from states such as Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China “is intensifying that pressure even further with advertising publications in our free press.”
“To try to spread their propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of free speech and free press when attempting to publish a payment ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you see only a few discrepancies and no real reflection of the disparities people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that is taking the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers circumvented the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before mid-term vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing rows in favor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially by women, may occur in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and it is many Republicans who have expressed that they want to move on with the vote.
“In these kinds of matters, it’s not possible to back down,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher claimed he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to stand in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm the disliked voters on this matter.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters gathered at the Senate gates chanted "November is coming!" at the moment when the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine's testimony.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of the way,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and indeed it is.
But it could be even older, especially among undecided women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which he counted in detail his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated there could be a setback if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
“This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s no longer just a matter of committee voting or the final vote, not even whether they sit on Kavanaugh’s bench; it’s also about how Republicans have handled all of this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don’t know who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, although they are a few more who put themselves on the side of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents said they believed Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Kavanaugh had probably or definitively lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements as well as, at least, those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company that is based on the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “to dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology so that users can create their own “online personal data storage” or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
Something that is unique in the storage of personal data online is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the template who hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all of their business models are completely modified from one day to the next.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this upcoming era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was “of a special symbolism” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned him the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", advanced the line before reaching a single-handed cannon and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I could never reach his height, but they were very adorable."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a flower crown after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "all a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of an authentic hero is evident when he is shown such a large backing."
MMA fans were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so you don’t get to see the main event at the end.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the UK it was to be rebroadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay awake until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the switch to cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There is a government regulation that regulates content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when we asked him about the broadcast.
"Peppa la pordita," yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will modify the show to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
“When I think about the relay option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our own time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule was changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally did. We tried to offer more than usual so the fans were happy and we had fun.
This is a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior for his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he came to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
On the first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Lawrence, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to lose importance in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest of his childhood, because "you were not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, “Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what really gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in this year’s Commonwealth Games held in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to convey that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who has been with him for 20 years, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so much since you're so young" (it was his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone the same age who's gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June who was called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their “global outlook” had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had passports for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wasn’t going to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that exact moment that he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At the time I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine at the Olympics, there was nothing better," he said.
This was also the fact that inspired him when he chose his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to keep it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to get a record for the 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to agree to cheer at times and at others to try to perfect his game on the field and be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, not even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National, where the long rough continuously punishes with erroneous blows.
And, if the field is no longer disappointing enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual games, kicked off in an impressive way, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and could not say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he had today, gave me a shove on my back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it should be.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will outperform Nick Faldo’s record of more Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last of an entire Ryder Cup career that had never matched its individual brand levels so clearly.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence provided many more intangible values to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players have been thrilled to have it as support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings so much more than just a game.”
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows very well that even if you enter with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where one team captained by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish the others by kicking their heels by a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"Don't stop reminding you that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but for very little," Bjorn said, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and everyone that that team is not finished.
You have to give it every morning.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the dots are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more and no less than the best players in the world.”
Proud of what their players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I wouldn’t want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is the individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens to a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you test all your ability as a golfer.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s up to you to leave your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as a couple, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both extremes in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team he won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe performed the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super-important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour,” Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman's Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery bothered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very reduced acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be outdated by the time they begin service, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate took over last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the personnel on the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also posed a problem.
It is believed to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion ($36 billion), rather than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of the recent warnings on the reduction of the naval power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is “losing ships capable of deploying.”
The officer said the problem has worsened over time, because the old boats were dropped, but have not been replaced with others.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state in the Scottish Highlands, seeks to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything that is discovered is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide upcoming conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as Daubenton’s coastal bats and long-eared browns from Inverewe’s gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds that are collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of calls from bats and what species do it.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Flea populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and, occasionally, rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated the first and only bat reserve in Scotland in the state of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Thrave, we have a fantastic bat area,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still a lot unknown about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It underlines the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be involuntarily destroyed and 400 females and pups could be killed, which would annihilate an entire local population.
Fleas are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
“We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers are chasing the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has categorized the rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to get known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was posted, 33-year-old Ronaldo typed the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner looking at the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to be famous by just mentioning me, but that's it, I can't help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations that appear in what they have called “an inadmissible report of suspicions in the area of privacy,” Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
Apparently, the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents recorded in Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was in a “99 percent” a “good guy” and that he had disappointed that remaining “one percent.”
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consenting.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and that they took photographs of the wounds at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she had "terror of retaliation" and was concerned "to be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to cancel the deal, as she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has switched to Juve, a major in Italian football for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: the UK would always regret the loss of automakers
The UK “would regret it for a lifetime” if it lost its position as a world leader in auto manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK would notify the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily stopped at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the repercussions of delays in customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that, if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns to which car manufacturers refer revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture custom cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and parts shortages.
For Toyota it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case, production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which establishes future relations with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at border crossings.”
“We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now, but we have to take the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Toyota’s evidence, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and compelling plan that defines our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “postpone another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The anticipation of whether Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general or not and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence has fuelled Washington’s turmoil for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself wore to try to resign the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, among news reports where he is said to be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the United Nations in New York at the time) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been defined, it could be this week or it could be postponed another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting with grandiosity, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are fanatical."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more sessions of questions and answers than any other president before him,” he said, quoting without evidence: “We have contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask directly the president of the United States, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We try to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in recent weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences with him only take place on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president demonstrated why it was like this, where he made a rash and, at times, bizarre appearance before the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to remain with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working on public services that are not dependent on the central government.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations have followed between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which they chose to make the expected decisions this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario where there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very confusing for you.
And it is for this very reason that I would like to reiterate now how much I appreciate the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, was surgically intervened in an emergency after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodore, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came to the band and crashed right there,” Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a bench and taking him to a thorough examination.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there was no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with a total of 18 for the entire season.
Foreigners will be subject to a superior estate transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be subject to a superior estate transfer tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra money raised with this measure will be used to accommodate the “roofless,” according to the Conservatives’ new plans.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
Increasing farm transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to be allocated to the “roofless”
The extra money raised with the increase in the transfer tax from estates to foreign property buyers in the UK will go to aid for the “homeless,” Theresa May announced today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises of providing more affordable housing to attract younger voters and harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in farm transfer tax will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be destined to encourage government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the buy-to-let system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are bought by people who do not reside in the UK, which causes rising prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country’s richest areas (especially in the capital) have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a transmission tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping very high prices on the property by avidly buying land without intent to use it, and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of evictions for no reason.
It also proposes granting local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that involves solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become a coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in League One (England’s third league division), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s something that has always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland executive include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he switched to such established names in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club undoubtedly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I’ve achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.”
Ross has only been training as a coach for three years, having been an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably an authentic crossroads," he recalled in reference to when Alloa was taken over.
“I always thought the direction was what I liked best, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I was able to make a good living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life where I’ve felt better, no doubt about it.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heatwave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but it has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant earnings fell 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s corporate consultancy, which collected the figures, said: “The warmth of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still made July the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased 2.8% of their profits, although restaurants have even more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mostly beverages had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered from heat, though not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose by 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the market of activities outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for catering operators and the weather will tell if the milder temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees UK restaurant, bar and pub sales, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents.
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, conducted to 20,000 high school students, revealed growth in fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears that sexual content will be published
20% of students claim to have a "main" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published.
20% of students said they had a sanitized “main” account they showed their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who happened to meet her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to “violate me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish Athletics Federation’s directive as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having it in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I like to be the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!”
Advertisement of the sack where it compares to mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A snail company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad where it compares to mothers breastfeeding cows to whom they ordain.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the “world’s first silent bag,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing mothers telling them the freedom the new milk extractor gives them.
Four royal women dance in a hay-filled barn on a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics like "Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a huge controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the dairy “horrors.”
“It’s a very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, except that they are taken away from their babies days after mating,” one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: “Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was: "What a more blatant announcement."
However, other people defended the ad, as a woman who admitted that the song was "destructive."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd probably have one.
When I was using the pump, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a bit allotted, but I don't give it any more.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers using a breastfeeding pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement, neither the dairy sector is praised nor judged.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discrete bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pull out the milk with the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly couples inside the lactation bra, allowing its users to move around, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of lactation pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and upcoming way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded along the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained minor immigrants has seen a significant increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to accommodate a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential pawns and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Office, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80% of sponsors or their families are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute the minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to reception centre workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for protection shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to reception centre workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent abductions or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked.
In addition, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on U.S., France and Turkey’s “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there were adequate conditions for them to return and blamed “some Western countries” for “seeding irrational fears” that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, has made clear that the deal had “clear deadlines” and has expressed hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, who will “be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members shortly to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a dismissal or scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
There are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, indexes reached at peak audience hours have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channel indexes with 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we haven’t yet understood,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of Designated Survivor, an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," was Scovell's response.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information goes beyond limits when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” the 15,000-dollar ostrich leather hunter Paul Manafort’s “postmy implications” and “The Washington’s “Storm of Pride” story.
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario again the same way.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes it all look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks to us about Trump’s alternate cast and his daily twists on the plot (whether it’s going into a fight against the NFL).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get off the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all that program crazy and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows into the House’s tightest half-term elections
Not surprisingly, the influx of money is coming to Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This Pittsburgh residential district, whose structure was recently redesignated, has Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a funding dispute for campaigns between the party’s major financial arm, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although after it pushed back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization administration team.
State Department officials have decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around $140 million in 2017 for, among other issues, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was for the conference to proceed, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence plans to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of Trump’s justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation into the possibility that Trump’s campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to stand before voters again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionalities, and with that I do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the dispute.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to give a coup d'état against Hitler, but it was only necessary that the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good spot since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to take office.
Rosenstein says The Times’ explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Besides all this, will we vote in the midterm elections a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these exams, we will find a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimist against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from achieving his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We managed to get a good point because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but in general, the tie was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went all out and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they already got a good result in the previous game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now you notice a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
The Fear of Retirement Savings Is Making Some Women Lose Sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their relatives.
About half of people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want to be looked after by a family member, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get attention, as those options can be a cost-determining factor.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-worth hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses, or insure yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of legal battles.
Ensure that you get a health care power to designate a trusted person who oversees your health care and ensures that professionals fulfill their own wishes in case they are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a notary power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all of these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors should we treat?” asks Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned.”
Shooting a man with a carabiner several times in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a carabiner several times as he came home walking after leaving at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as a “random act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have made a call to possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, officials said, with the number expected to increase.
With communications blocked, assistance officials have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggara in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Belt of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes.
Below are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic recalling the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that caused the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, when a friend of hers tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin has been ordered to pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained with an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when his statement was requested, the chain reported.
Palin faces three Class A minor offenses, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B minor offence, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and of possessing a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed to have punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the timing of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out last October an attack on a bike lane on the West Side highway of Lower Manhattan, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists he found in his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges entail a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury brought to Saipov a charge of 22 charges that included eight charges of organized crime-assisted murder, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried out it as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District filed a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal New York case was to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be insulated in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are “obviously disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Take Over Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the popular army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should take charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham concentration that the UK would have "already left" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has highlighted even more as a group of Tories in favor of the stay have joined an opposition protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the commitment plan that was signed in Chequers amid the attacks of Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos."
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where she told reporters: “I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like Chequers’ plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favour and is not popular among our party and our activists, who are actually those who go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the concentrators that it would have to make politicians “feel the heat” if they were seen to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them that we won’t let them get away with theirs.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are going to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay took to the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they had with an application of the party during the inauguration of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Considers All Possibilities for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider all chances of running for president” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a usual criticism of President Donald Trump, will face re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes that there is a woman at the top.
A Man Arrested for LSU Sims Player's Gun Murder
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man who is seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that eventually led to his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been at the scene of the crime, in possession of a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
The Sims, a 1.98-metre-high Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, being the top 10, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxing and let Hamilton run in the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out forcefully one lap later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after an action with the wheels almost glued that made the Ferrari driver have to badly win the free interior at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and took seventh place at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race as he clung to his tyres to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered boxing in lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by recovering Raikkonen's fourth position.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of getting a perfect pair," Hamilton said.
That's been a really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the Supreme Court nominee.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are evil, disgusting and false,” he said.
"When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, 'But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn’t filter it,” he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal did not seem to sit well for the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been a really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnance, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to stumble to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars fixed the loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial two-goal lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe’s men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided assistance for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively starting period, Sullivan put the local team back to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to match the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard again matched the match with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match when reaching the end of the second half and secured the victory with his team's fifth goal as the end approaches.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape the plane from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his position at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news channel ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people, the national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and not many people have been contacted," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?", CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini Says Man Disappeared After Air Accident In A Laguna
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared, after saying the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be noticed.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were following Saturday at the hospital and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s something extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes says he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was starting to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were carrying out near a dock improvement work also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under water.
Aviation safety network data indicates that 111 people have died in accidents from airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended the submission of its arguments on Saturday in a new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to chain the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took to the stage on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my van was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
The cell phone records indicated that they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would remain in the jury's hands that same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop Consciousness?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip hop has strayed from its origins from political messages and from dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny asks a couple to fire her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dismay when she discovered that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, he was sent to Maurice twice.
After realizing her patting, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice saying her former nanny, who was an African-American, had done a very bad job and was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day’s work and sent home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal work position she had been hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t get done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice’s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife had sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to go for someone like that?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been in a hurry to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was hard to put yourself in someone’s place who read it for the first time before its publication.
It’s a great pleasure to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before drawing inspiration from a toy snail to write the children's book, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was somewhat "sweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very calm man and he didn’t like to brag,” he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that I wasn’t expected to achieve it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, honey.
I'll be ready with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep pumping his heart were slowly depleted and left his system.
She had died before time and everything was going down.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I fell head and tears fell on me all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicides are working to prevent others from being killed.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis' son, was 13 when she began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up anywhere.”
However, he left work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after taking his life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don’t sit still, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies’s for years, lost Mark, her partner whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “Leave a vacuum in the whole family.
It has left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread at the moment the FBI starts the investigation
“I thought if we could really get something like what we were asking for (a limited-time, limited-reaching investigation), maybe we could bring in some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going to peak” amid a partisan paralysis.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its negation is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections, on November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to get the man they want for the country’s highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pushing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s deserters numbers “fall” with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said last year there were 1,127 desertions, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and high tariffs charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed to work on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a “hysterical” and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the excitement to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost yelling and clapping as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the accusations against them “gross and clearly coordinated defamations” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won’t be able to not only be in the Supreme Court, you won’t even be able to be in the court you’re in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think everything is fine,” Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It is a justifiable diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and she cannot let go without crying.
“We cried when we got angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do I?"
She went on to say, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was executive at a company and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Perhaps you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then I continued with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the strawberry and dragged me on a ladder.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he told me.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think you’ve been ripped off.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential career.
In 1987, when they caught Hart on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which he had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came to the conclusion that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would run for the presidency.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” he told me in laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already very advanced, it was left behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not re-enter the race unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, she was only given $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she delivered her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration for a system that made fundraising difficult and focused on recruiting voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), that she was attracted to.
"The logical thing would have been to think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the press reaction.
“You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.

Trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salaries from the U.S.-China trade war were staggering, and while there is still much left to end the battle, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by setting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in goods, taxing half of the goods entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliation, recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has committed to matching U.S. attacks, and the world’s second most powerful economy is unlikely to loosen soon.
Getting Washington back would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressures could positively help China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could give the conditions for starting a slump in the economy in any of the two countries is actually far more dangerous than viewers have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused associate researcher for the American Security Center’s strategic cabinet.
Syria Is Ready for Refugees to Return, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already in place.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside of Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell by 5 and 4 defeat to the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World No. 1 player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2nd and 1st to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament victories of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy that I was able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very happy that I have been able to help,” said one excited Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a after the victory of the European team.
Now the torch passes to his compatriot John Rahm, who already on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles game.
“I feel incredible pride in having defeated Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed the situation in Europe.
But we lost him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players have made a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys so much and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's up to us to tilt our heads.
Nos nos surado".
