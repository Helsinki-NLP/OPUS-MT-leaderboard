Crying to the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and the screams and screams in nature are starting to attract people across the globe.
"You own the team, I need Iceland," said a woman outside in the big world, in comments on an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the content channel YouTube.
Another spectator greeting will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she will have to get to Iceland as soon as she can live there.
Unfortunately, she is in the U.S. and expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another observer asks if the walkway to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
I don't know if he's from another time zone.
Egill <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xB0>arson of the Peel advertising agency, who came to make the advertisements along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the receptions have been expected further.
“I came up with many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well but this new campaign is already underway.
Basically, it’s about creating PR value, it’s getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it’s gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, reaching a total of roughly two billion people.
The value of the survey is estimated at SEK 1.8 billion.
It's not awkward."
The main market of all is the United States and the campaign has gone very well, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also welcomed them, such as Russia, which comes comfortably by surprise.
Then there have been reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which was not particularly put up with.
“These ads have traveled farther than we lived with,” says Egill, but it is possible that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The photos here at the opening were taken by <0xC3><0x81>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, photographer of Morgunbladin, and we took on advertisements that bear the headline “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The paintings went on wide and wide, such as at the Sk<0xC3><0xB3>lav<0xC3><0xB0>ur<0xC3><0xB0>ur st<0xC3><0xAD>gis in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, in Reynisfjör, near Sk<0xC3><0xB3>garfoss, at S<0xC3><0xB3>lheimajökli and near Hjörleifshöf<0xC3><0xB0>a.
The directors were Sam<0xC3><0xBA>el Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar P<0xC3><0xA1>ll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and filmmaker <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
In the role were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the announcements, but at the same time as recordings took place in the South, there was another group in the West and West Fjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first item in the Looks Like You Need Iceland tour, but is aimed at a winter tour in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first step in this work for the Icelandic Institute,” says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the boundaries with which we are talking."
Explosives: Discussing the position on the labour market, life insurance fund and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children’s Affairs, arrives in Sprengisand, which starts at ten o’clock in the Gulf today.
He is also the Labour Market Minister and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural issues and transport activities in countries that have gone badly and have been debated in recent years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, the chairman of VR, will also attend the show, but he will discuss his views on the investment of life insurance funds and present ideas for the movement of employees and employers to withdraw from the management of the pension funds.
They will then be discussed with <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>i J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, director of the Nordic Market, and <0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, tourism service provider in the country.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading prediction of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a memorable career in all kinds of youth roles.
She became famous for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened to her lately, but she got to look over the way and express herself about Clueless on Australian television these days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the character of the greatest knowledge on the girls I met in school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was," Donovan told Clueless.
He didn’t want to leave the police station after a night out.
About 50 cases were reported to the police in the capital area today, and the police diary says that the case has been varied.
The day at the police station in Hverfisgötu began with the police having to exchange a person who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there due to a felony arrest.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police telling him to go away.
The man won a permanent stay at the police station because of his ex-husband’s conduct.
At the time, a man was arrested this morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kopavogi.
Police were also required to have two men in Breidholti, due to reports of a body attack.
Then it also happened that a woman who was sitting in a shopping mall in Kopavogi could not pay the bill at the end of the meal and was called to the police.
There were also reports of car theft in the city this morning.
The driver of the white Renault transmitter searched for her for a moment and she was then taken by an independent hand.
The car has not been found.
The Destruction of the Gladiator - The Horrible Fate of the Gleaming Stars
This teaching has flown through the Internet to a curse resting over the series about Joy, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and became there with the third main character to leave her life for a century.
The episodes of the Glee are a popular drama series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The episodes focused on the so-called joys of young people in school, their love and destiny.
It was not always taken out by the celebrity to be in the cheerleading scene but through singing and dancing, the characters of the characters seemed to overcome every situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the scene, there have been great horrors over the players and the staff of the characters, so much so that the teachings have awakened about the curse resting on the characters.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santon Lopez in the show, a clapper who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the show's release, Rivera owned actor Ryan Dorsey and brought with him her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to present a lover and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a row on a boat in Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a rescue vest on board the boat, and he could report to police that he and his mother had drowned and so Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned there himself.
There was a great search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that we had assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially cut dead.
It is believed that she has fallen into a lot of currents in the water and made use of her last claim in saving her son.
The cause of death was recorded intoxicated by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American footballer with the angel voice who played a key role in driving the joy of life to the road and respect.
Without the elements, Moneith clung to a personal devil.
At the age of 13, he had become addicted to alcohol and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his co-workers found enough to come in, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went on treatment and everything seemed to be looking for a better way.
Just two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein proved to be a deadly mixture of narcotics and alcohol.
It wasn’t meant to be a matter of will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drug administration had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated well, proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His soul was heavily burdened by his collaborators, but under his rival, Lea Michele, he was determined to continue taking part and consecrating the entire memory of Moneith and his character Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling took on the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his contemporaries in the Joy League, or until he gained the passion to admit that he enjoyed it.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child molestation.
While we were searching his home, a huge amount of child abuse was found, and the matter was soon publicly questioned.
It was clear that Saling was already there.
He was subsequently indicted and convicted of his crime.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison in addition to what he found necessary to be on the list of sex offenders and seek treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge decided on the sentence, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just the players who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He fell asleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
We also got a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the great star Julie Roberts and bore her sister not a good story, but she accused Roberts of great governance and contemptuous achievement.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she suffered from severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her employer in which she blamed her mother and sister, among other things, for how she was treated.
“My mother and so-called siblings get nothing from me except the reminder that it was they who suffered my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been charged with applying her co-stars to the take-off location and being with a disposable constellation.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with euthanasia in 2019, which suffered a great deal of embarrassment.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, it was discovered that an unidentified computer network appeared in nectar photos of her and appeared on the Internet.
Players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had a love affair outside of the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the maturity of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and pollinate.
It can also be done endlessly with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Having time with the kids in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the flowers and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
He bought a boat in the 10th grade.
“I don’t think we are many sailors who work in the country’s playgrounds,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who spends the summer at the University of Iceland studying psychology during the winter.”
Beach resorts are a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it’s great to be able to let go of taking a study loan.
I'm also well suited for the winter," says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychiatrist, who spends his summers at the beach like last summer.
Axel was the newest to brew at T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafir<0xC3><0xB0> when a journalist received a speech from him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“The wind that I was in the tenth grade, I took control of boats that are less than 12 meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I graduated from elementary school.
I’ve been sailing on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann's son, and I let the boat name him.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he had bought the boat for three million.
“I made a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I was fishing.
So I had the boat on it at the end of my first summer.”
But how could a boy have had one and a half million to pay off in a boat when he had just started elementary school?
“I had already laid out and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all swarming with him and got my share.
“I also put my money in my pockets.”
Axel was born in Isafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the western region because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in Isafir.
I learned in this area here to the west of the rows with my dad.
I’m moving between the distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire West Bank.
Although I like to be in the west, I have also provided around the Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnes and beyond.
I have also provided for the south, but I prefer to have a barbecue," says Axel, who always touches one fireman in the morning and sometimes says to speak to the magnate and sing for the sky, the only time we get together on the ballerina.
“The network at sea is good, so I can call, listen to the radio and music.
I don’t feel like I’m alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing high, but certainly something has been unusual times in the weather, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky to never be a sailor.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the hunts go each time.
“I’ve never been on the beach for more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example, in the rental quota, but then I’ve been consistently fishing for a day and a half in a row.”
According to the Coast Guard, he is able to fish 770 kilograms a day, which he feels is a hamlet.
“Other barriers are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish for twelve days a month, for the four months that beach fishing lasts, in May, June, July and August.
To my mind, sailors should choose their hunting days depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is for men to rest instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their heads.
So the zoning could also go because of me and the marine space that is well located by the fishery should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who pulls the bulk of sea turtles from salted seas on his beach road, but also only ufsa and unique other species float with it.
Axel works during the winter with a university degree at the N<0xC3><0xBA>pi school in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogi.
“I don’t think we’re a lot of sailors who work in the country’s playgrounds,” says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the playground.
“I’m stuck here because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that in the future I will benefit from psychology in the playground," says Axel, who has also come a long way with a degree in business science.
Errors in registration prevented home repatriation
An error in the registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country happened so that an individual, resident here in the country, was not called back in the sample.
It is not necessary to register an ID number if the person concerned fills out the form in English, as it is when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be examined this week,” says a specialist in the field of regional medicine.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at the Department of Virology of the Lands<0xC3><0xAD>talan yesterday.
One of those who proved positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called home visitation took effect.
Those who were resident in Iceland were then assigned to commune to the country and again preached in a sampling four to five days later.
It was revealed in the afternoon news of the R<0xC3><0x9A>V that the person concerned had, however, followed the old system.
The border sampling was negative and was not recalled to the screen for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigf<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of regional medicine, says in a conversation with a news agency that this may be due to a mistake in the electronic journal.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a requirement to insert a ID number similar to the one in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it is designed for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned has not been automatically invited to come to a sampling.
Kamilla says many have adhered to home screening rules even though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alerted to sending people back for sampling after it arrived in the country.
“This will be reviewed in the week how it is possible to make it easier for people to access it to arouse its attention during the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement, and six have been put in confinement.
They all went to a sampling, but two of them started showing symptoms.
Infections are currently underway with the three infections that were diagnosed yesterday, but it is largely completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequence analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In another case, the ban has pointed out that Israel, although it is known that the person who transported the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be in the morning where the virus would come from.
In total, there are now 15 in isolation according to the COVID. is.
135 are in the process.
Four out of five infections unconnected
Five domestic infections have been detected here in the country in recent days.
Four of them are completely unrelated and there is no way to find the origin of the infection that emerged at yesterday’s Rey Cup sporting event.
Infection is still prevalent.
Originally they were on the third tug individually sent to the queue, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 cases have been reported due to these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that has been identified at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether to hold such an event.
J<0xC3><0xB3>hann K. J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsson, Director of Communications at the Department of Public Protection of the Federal Police, says it very slowly, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
“We are constantly making clear to all those who live here that there is a need to maintain a personalized protection against infection.
We also need to make clear to people who are holding events that there are certain rules in progress that need to be followed.
“It’s possible to have an event,” John said.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping individual-linked anti-infectious agents in the air.
In addition, the rules and criteria are in constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and the local medical staff are constantly making clear to the people, is to think about these individual communicable diseases.
Both for homeowners and the same for service providers.
People wash their hands and use liquor.
It prevents the infection from going on,” says John.
“We need to make sure that people continue on the good path we have been on, in order to sustain the success we have achieved so far.”
40% of the victims of COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult it was for her father to breathe.
Her father was suffering from diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to a sudden difficulty in breathing due to coronary virus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, who is also suffering from diabetes, is concerned that nothing will happen.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fear is not unreasonable.
According to a recent study by the U.S. government, only 40 percent of those who died were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus as an underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the percentage increases by half.
A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that more than 10,000 people in 15 countries died from the coronavirus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
A fall in the slow growth of Reuters allowed a survey and pointed out the responses from the 12 states that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet begun to identify the underlying diseases, according to the report.
“Diabetes was at a slow pace.
Now COVID-19 has broken through as powerful a century," according to Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gotten worse from the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with fitness, a healthy diet and the help of health professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine for a week.
A high price of insulin has taken some time to continue to work and to stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters reports that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
As SARS passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in 2009, this group was at three times the risk of having to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study found that 60% of those who died or had been admitted to the hospital had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the virus has swept away a number of previously unknown complications.
“I fear that we will see a flood of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that coronary artery disease may indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, including kidney disease and renal excretion.
As well as directing new studies to ensure that the coronavirus can lead to the increase in diabetes mellitus.
According to Reuters, scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus occurs in the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
A high percentage of glucose and lipids in diabetics can then be triggered by a true ‘cell messenger storm', as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard to the body.
Damaged intravenous cells can also lead to immunisation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle game,” says Dela Cruz.
“It has to do with everything.”
The news has been corrected.
“They were offered champagne, so they left the room.”
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir’s wife and Atli Bollason got the unusual bond from the filmmaker Ragnari Kjartansson to spend sex in front of a camera for the work that the artist was installing in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t difficult.
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother-in-law, <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>na Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
“I was very fascinated by her.
Of course, it was just the radio, but it also seemed pretty cute to me.
“I still feel,” he says.
As a result of this, the husband’s first meeting was regularly scheduled.
“I’ve always heard this story.
“It’s just the weekend,” she says, adding to her husband’s first appearance.
“I felt and felt so much excitement around Atla that I felt.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I’m excited about it.”
Atli says the couple have emphasized it in their relationship to go their own ways.
“We don’t tie our backs the same knots as the passengers.
"We're avoiding the routines we're dealing with around us."
There is a possible reason why they took the invitation from Ragnari Kjartansson to the artist just joyfully, although it would be easier to say unusually.
“Krist<0xC3><0xAD>n Anna our mutual friend has contacted us and asks if we can come and have a dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörgu Ragnar’s wife, on Snaps.”
They invited, met the trio on Snaps and got a desert wine and a dessert each time.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through their design at an art exhibition that he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
“He had a lot of videos called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n says he described the work as banal and decadent from the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had a sketch of all the old men he was going to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in.”
The scene in which Ragnar asked the couple to participate was supposed to show a young middle-class couple to fall in love in a minimalist room.
“These are relationships with beginnings and endings,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much, though they knew about him and he about them “but they knew us and found us fit in this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise to people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who get sexually abducted from performing for others.”
They married Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we came out of Snaps, we said, ‘Are we not just in this?’
It was just like that.
I trusted Ragnari as an artist and all his team," says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atli.
“It’s all about love and love.”
She was taken to a nice apartment on Myrargötun.
There was a very poor film team; the filmmaker, Ragnar and the musician and the couple.
After the ignition had been on the recording, all the rooms left to wait outside in the car except Atli and <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
“We haven’t decided what we should be like.
We were given a few instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
But was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli and <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n agrees.
“They were invited to a champagne party before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the work that moved them.
“When Tommy was watching this, he was crying, and he liked it so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s just as much about love and affection as it is about relationships,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother had heard the voice in her son at the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Academy and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts to talk about it,” says Atli.
“Mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone this way, but my dad just sent me a message saying, “It’s great to have a little family at the Palais de Tokyo,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
And does the participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atla?
“At least we’re still together, so maybe this deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my family,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and laughs.
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n himself saw the work in the merchant harbour with his colleague.
“I found it a little hard not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was fun to see this because it’s only one time in a much bigger work and when you see it with the other works, it’s really great.
I was able to get away with it and I was just proud.
And there was a little boon in my stomach," says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n, who was sick of the other child of the couple when the semen was taken up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with them <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>na and Atla in Love Stories on R<0xC3><0xA1>s 1.
Swansea wins in the first round
Swansea won 1–0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the finals of the playoffs to make it to the English national team.
The game was played at Swansea's home in Wales.
The halfway point was 0-0.
The Swansea nationals scored in the 64th minute, while Andre Ayew beat the boxer out of the scoreboard and let go.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, player Brentford, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game less and in the 82nd minute Swansea players enjoyed the team's spirit.
Andre Ayew improved the wicket by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea a 1–0 win.
Swansea lead 1–0 in a 1–0 draw, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at home Brentford.
Unemployed for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to get an armed lifeguard as he feared his life.
However, it has not been easy for the president of the United States to appoint an ambassador to the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as U.S. ambassador in April 2009, she has been without a U.S. ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under special circumstances, but Kastlj<0xC3><0xB8>s reported from 2009 that she should have received the Falcon Word.
On the occasion of a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Bureau of the matter that she would not accept the word.
After she left Iceland, she taught international communication at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
It may be that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but then he ceased.
At last, Loius Ariega had been working in the foreign service for the last decade.
He then resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up office as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then I took a second time without an ambassador.
Robert Barber passed the approval of the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly thereafter, but then no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and a supporter of Barack Obama's electoral fund.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is the custom of a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington administration.
It took him two years before the U.S. Congress announced his meeting with Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask him questions and confirm his appointment as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in Congress, he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been broken by a Dutch mountain.
Gunter is a political appointee, previously a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Sheldon Adelson, the owner of the casino, founded the association, while Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest case in the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s administration has been appointing people in key positions as well as that in recent years the U.S. Congress’s work has slowed down a lot, including confirming the ambassador to office.
Since 2009, he has been without an ambassador to Iceland for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented implementation by the embassy that opened the new headquarters in Engjateig.
The constructions are thought to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the safety barriers around the building and the glazed glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s security awareness because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished to get armed lifeguards.
The first player of the IBV became for racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, says he became a fan of racism when he was in Iceland and that he looks after his arrival in Iceland.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny, who appeared on the magical media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as a player in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tony talks about many things, including his time here in the country, but he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val and Tr<0xC3><0xB3>tti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team's squad was in that position but he also had the number of thirty that I wanted, so I got neither of what I wanted," said Tonny, who played in the right corner of the season with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny is talking about is racism that happened in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players will face when they play in Europe.
“It came to me once, but when I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent had let a racist comment fall on me after I taunted him."
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He said he made the most of the mistakes he had made.
Tonny hadn't been able to make it to Haugesund's starting team, but he wanted to play more to make it to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but then he went to the team with Val.
“It was a mistake to go back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted to have," Tonny said, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably come further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has turned out to be his dream of getting big in Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch-long black worm in a woman's neck that was searching there.
The doctor managed to pull the worm out with a towel.
A study showed that there was a case of snails.
CNN is reporting on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered shortly after the worm was removed, but snails such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi rubbed into space in the West, there have been instances where snails have been drilled into people, CNN said.
Fears that another wave is beginning in Europe.
Spain is currently in a state of emergency due to concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where authorities have taken steps to re-emerge the spread of the coronavirus.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action due to an increase in the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go to the country of origin from Spain, like in Norway, and France has been warned of travel to Spain.
Infections are also rising again in France and Germany, where the authorities are trying to find a balance in order to stop the spread of the virus and bring the economy back to normal.
The location in Europe is, however, good compared to elsewhere in the world, but new infections worldwide reach 300,000 a day, with the most common in America and South Asia.
According to the Johns Hopkins University, there have been 16 million confirmed infections worldwide, and there have been 644,000 confirmed deaths associated with the virus.
Mosaic Artery finally gets to enjoy it to its fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more memory slots.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the walking path is accessible and there are now many visitors and admirers of artworks from millions of mosaic tiles —like they have never seen before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least it didn’t count for it.
The work has so far been somewhat concealed, directly in front of it there were parking lots that were always occupied.
People laid there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to remember their memories in the city center.
The "living and diverse public spaces" and "advancing urban areas" are the guiding lights for the reconstruction of the now-defunct Tryggvag<0xC3><0xA5>t.
The aim is to reduce the area and allow Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir’s mosaic at the Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>sin to enjoy a better view.
In front of the building there will be a square and since the area is well located by the sun, it is considered a good place to stay for road users.
The list work will be described and now the material will be enjoyed better than before on this 142 square meter plot.
In the area, there will also be small "snails", some kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and provide the area with a certain duel.
In this way, the renovations are described by Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k City, which is being carried out together with Veitum.
Layers of water supply, heat supply and electricity will be recycled.
Many of them have reached their age, but the school buildings and the cold water law date back to 1925 and have thus served the inhabitants and businesses of the city centre for quite a century.
When the street is reopened at the end of the day, cars can drive around it again.
But it will be a one-stop shop and soon create a quieter and more accessible space for walkers.
In a press release on the Customs Office on the website of the Customs Director, the building was put into use in 1971, but its architect was G<0xC3><0xAD>sli Halld<0xC3><0xB3>rsson.
Due to the debris reaching through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wall slabs formed out onto the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such floors would have a bad effect on the overall streetscape, if special measures were not taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
Participants therefore agreed to calculate by allowing a permanent artwork to be installed there.
During this time, a lot of words went by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>i Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively in mosaic works in Germany and beyond.
The consultation was to contact her first before deciding whether to be able to compete for the project.
It had often been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the port, after all, the port had been the life of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k since it was done.
When she was talking to the artist, she became deeply engrossed in such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she moved back out of the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerder was given the time she had to decide for herself, and when she returned home she made a few suggestions for the discussion.
She was immediately accepted to ask her to work on the project.
It was also desired to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Gerdur had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Agreements were made and Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur won the artwork under the installation at the workshop of their brothers, who then saw the installation at the Customs House.
All the work was individually well done, both by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttur and the Oidtmann brothers, says in the summary.
Since then, there has been a turbulent Icelandic climate.
It took Ger<0xC3><0xB0>i about two years to work on the work, which was completed and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The listacon died two years after the customs work was completed, only 47 years old.
More companies are moving out of the country
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs, has announced that more public institutions will be relocated to the country in the near future.
This was said by the Prime Minister in the episode Explosive in the Gulf at lunchtime.
Recently, it was announced that the Brunam<0xC3><0xA1>lasvi<0xC3><0xB0>i Housing and Human Resources Agency will be moved north to Saud<0xC3><0xA1>rk<0xC3><0xB3>k this fall.
Six specialists in the field of firefighting work with the agency, but none of them intend to follow the institution north and the Landssamband of the extinguishing and hospital transporters has benefited from the housing transfers.
“I think we need to take a step further in this process.
I’m going to take another step in this process.
“There’s more traffic,” said <0xC3><0x81>smundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public works out of the country, like I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency," said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, but he also took the example of other institutions in the field of migration to the country.
All the best from the second day of the championship
The 94th Icelandic Open Sports Championships ended today in <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsveli, Akureyri.
A few matches were played on the second day of the race.
It was an exciting competition in the most delicate women in <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvell, but Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s J<0xC3><0xB3>nsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from FH put <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in the most delicate year of 2014, which stood until Elisabeth Ruth R<0xC3><0xBA>narsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from Ireland added the score in May last year.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s won the <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form lately, but she has tripled the <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti what is summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and has not reached the finish line today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s threw the longest of them all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and immediately set the opponent.
She set her Icelandic goal earlier in July at 62.69 meters and was, however, somewhat distant from it.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Kar<0xC3><0xAD>tas Hallgr<0xC3><0xAD>msd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from Ireland had the second best throw of the day, but she added her best performance with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH member Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, Iceland's manager, won the narrowest, safest victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his second last throw and set the opponent.
His Icelandic height in the section is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, <0xC3><0x93>lymp<0xC3><0xAD>ufari and <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmethafi in the round, won a ball race at Thorsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in the round, which is his main branch.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals is 65.53 meters away, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second time today, but he had one valid throw that came in 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ard<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmethafi in long-haul, won the long-haul ship with a surface, but Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s jumped 6.25 meters long today, which is only 40 cm from her <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet.
In the women’s 200-metre run, it was the IR champion Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na Bjarnad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir who was blown up but she scored in 24.04 seconds while her Icelandic goal in the section is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na was a winner in Akureyri but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100-metre race and in the 4 x 100-metre race and then also in the 4 x 400-metre race today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH was the first to score in the 200-metre run in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x93>liver M<0xC3><0xA1>na Samuelsson from <0xC3><0x81>rmann.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Do not get fined for 27 million kroner bitcoin scam
The super-tax committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a fine on a person for undermining his or her earnings due to the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The Committee concludes that the Director of Tax Research had not given a clear reason for why it was necessary to punish the man.
In the committee’s opinion, the director of tax research considered the person to have a place in understanding the materially incorrect tax returns due to the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have disproved his earnings that would have been generated by the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin up to 27 million, either intentionally or by a huge instability.
He punishes the man for his actions.
The man refused to do so in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he sold a coin for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>27 million.
In 2009 and 2010, Hana would have acquired a fortune by graft, when both would have been easy and expensive with a regular household.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electronic device, the tax liability for such sales was very uncertain and unpredictable.
It would have been better to expect that public citizens would be aware of such measures in the field of taxation.
He had not intended to avoid paying taxes on the harvest and had reported on his property on the future as a deposit in a foreign exchange account.
He would have asked both the experts and the governors about how this would be done, but without success.
At the time, he felt he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules on which the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view.
The man therefore rightly considered that his taxes for these two income years would be repaid and the burden applied, but otherwise not imposed a penalty.
He then admitted that he had been living in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He had never intended to do away with his duties in an unscrupulous way.
The demand for a fine would be out of all circumstances and would plunge him into debt.
The man says, “This man understands what football is all about.”
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur Andersen Willumsson has been talkative between the teeth of people, but also aroused an impetus for his performance of what is played with Breidablik in the Pepsi Max department.
Candles will be in the fire line tonight when they receive <0xC3><0x8D>A in a live broadcast on Stand 2 Sport.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur takes them out of the playground due to four reminders during the playtime and therefore does not come to play with a new cut as in the games of the summer so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his collar for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“I don’t know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but talking about the character, it was better to try in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if someone was going to equalize this game then I thought he would do it or create it," Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson told Pepsi Max.
“I have to be here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to know where he is.
He looks a little out on the left when it comes to feeling at the game, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliidason.
<0xC3><0x9E>orkell M<0xC3><0xA1>ni Pétursson says Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf really enjoys having such a colorful man in the department: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun guy and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There’s an incredible amount of people who are busy with him, who tell me that this guy understands what football is about.
“I am a fun force.
I want to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interview with Brynj<0xC3><0xB8>lf, people are paying in and watching what happens next on his hair.
“This man is a genius,” he said.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with some teams in Division B"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Danish media outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
F<0xC3><0xB3>tbolti.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to get to the start of the season in his home country but for that, he must first terminate his contract with KR where the Danish division starts before the Icelandic one looks like it.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown a great deal of understanding," Tobias told Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in Division B and I’m likely to switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay my contract with KR.”
Then he says he needs to take on all the bodies in Denmark to reduce wages.
“Failures in Denmark are likely to have found more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bicycle dealer Bjartmar has regained bikes for millions - Now responds by itself after review DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had interests unlike most others.
He wakes up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and bags.
Bjartmar has announced the name "the biker" for the week.
Yesterday there was a lot of confusion when one published a report of his interactions with Bjartmar.
The DV referred to them in a discussion on the Facebook group West Bengal, where it was found that Bjartmar had taken the man to speak on the East Coast and said the West may have been stolen.
There was nothing else that could be read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the preview of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the matter at all does not explain what really happened yesterday in the East.
Bjartmar said they had received information from victims of electric shocks that this was indeed their electric shock.
This information was allegedly received by the owner from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and I investigated the shooting, ending up with information that there was an electric shock that had been missing for a very long time and had been looking for.
I was definitely snoring at first, but when I saw him driving under the hood, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very well in such a case, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric box had invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called the police.
"Yes, fine," said Bjartmar, "let's just clean it up."
Then the owner of the electrician went to prove the ownership of his electrician and left.
Later, the owner of the electrician told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this space of years that Bjartmar has put a moment into his practice, he says he can count the shift that he made with people on the fingers of another hand.
“I have had peaceful contacts with the most difficult people in Reykjavik,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that the cyclists are the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, clowns, mentally ill people and other people who are part of it.
“The technology is a hard host and somehow we need to finance the next dose, because, unfortunately, theft of such loose funds is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My communication with these people is really so good that I have brought a lot of those good people with me on the team.
Examples are that people have gone to treatment and taken up and then looked for me and helped me with what I am doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with cyclists is on courteous nights.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, number of wheels and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says the police are more likely to start telling people to talk to him from stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous press release DV and says there is no self-defense police in a personal quest for justice.
Asked if he still hasn’t come to the top of the ice with his work, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly be.
“Of course the police have to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are absolutely not doing this.
I have to take a picture of the policemen driving away from a large herd of stolen wheels.
It’s absolutely unimportant in these matters.”
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can achieve success in this category of cases, then why not?” Bjartmar asks.
He says he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he hangs on his “skirts” on the street that they just have the Bjartmari wheels that they had previously got in.
The time Bjartmar has called for police assistance has come because she clearly does not arrive.
“It just doesn’t work with the police, and it’s not for me to teach and it’s not for the owners of the bikes to teach,” Bjartmar said, regretting that the victims of the bike theft had to feel the vacancy of the police in this category.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
You can find stories of people who thank Bjartmari for reaching out to them again.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts run in the millions, if not in the millions.
Roads where electric blowers, electric bikes and electric motors are heavy, but electric bikes can cost upwards of half a million.
Bjartmar works day to day at a kindergarten and every other weekend he works at a school.
His riding career is therefore an unremunerated work that he does in his free time.
Life Insurance Funds and Long Shadows
2019 was a big anniversary in the history of life insurance funds in Iceland.
Officials had, of course, received a pension from the Danish King on all streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 a life insurance fund of officials was established which eventually became a life insurance fund of all public servants.
The basis for the current pension funds of the general wage earners was then laid down by the general labour market agreements in 1969, which provided for an occupational pension fund with a compulsory membership and a fuller fund accumulation from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were enacted on the basis of these treaties, and the system of life insurance continued to be challenged thereafter.
The life cycle of the wage earners was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century brought about with its career struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been received in a similar way in historical employment initiatives in 1955, and the associations also gradually received their requirements for sickness and health care rights, a substantial right to leave, a shorter period of leave and a shorter period of working life, a change in pensions.
All of these rights cost a great and intense struggle, but it turned out to be, after all, a much greater and more lasting improvement than the increase in the auras of the wage war, which deteriorated evenly in the aftermath of the price inflation that marked the post-war period until 1990, as many remember.
The contribution to the establishment of the General Life Insurance Funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although the people finally come together that the funds would actually be the property of the mutual funds, the labor movement became to fall on the fact that their boards were obliged to appoint representatives of the employers and the mutual funds alike.
In the years following the founding of the funds, the demand for the majority of the workers in the board of the funds often came to a discussion in the employers’ associations, but it never reached a conclusion, and so we are still sitting up with the unusual arrangement that the representatives of the corporations are not in the society.
Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policies of the funds.
It states in Figure 1 that "life insurance funds shall have the interests of the fund's partners in the foreground."
In paragraph 5, it is also stated that “Life Insurance Funds shall set themselves a moral standard in investment.”
The shareholders’ policy of the Life Insurance Fund of merchants includes, inter alia, the following provisions, in the continuation of the above-mentioned legal provisions:
The Life Insurance Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investment, along with many of the largest life insurance funds and professional investors in the Western Ocean and in Europe.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance of companies, can contribute to the improvement of the investment ranking of securities firms.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of the national society are combined in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, set themselves a public policy: to maintain good governance, a socially responsible and environmentally responsible workforce.
The Valdi Life Insurance Fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself a “responsible investment policy” and there are provisions of similar trains.
This is all set out here that introduces Iceland’s newest fashion word, “shadow management”.
As the word is used in the case, it is not to be expected that it has been defined in detail, but to me the following definition now appears to be “most taken”: Shadow management is when a prominent chairman of a society of each party states in the media that he or she should send a full report.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be deflected from the board at the first adequacy.
If the president does not go with this in the media and does not talk about the resignation, however, it is not “shadow management” in the end such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I’ll let the reader think about how “shadow” he feels.
There are in particular two people who have tried to formulate this definition when it is written, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
They are Hör<0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0x86>gisson, a journalist at Fréttablad<0xC3><0xB0>i and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, the head of the central bank.
The matter came to the attention of the two of them after Bogi Nils Bogason, Icelandair’s chairman, had said of his intention to close the company’s contracts with air traffickers and airmen (repeat them), and L<0xC3><0xA1>j<0xC3><0xB3>r <0xC3><0x93>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, the chairman of the company’s board of businessmen of Reykja.
A few years later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and Ragnar Thor followed the same path with his recommendation, which, of course, focused on Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Hör<0xC3><0xB0>ur and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir reason to discuss the matter in the Friday newspaper of Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>is with big words about shadow management, lawbreaking and the rich need for changes to the laws.
There, a small pigeon really had to turn a heavy pigeon though the blessed pigeon had been in contact and also had been wiped out soon.
Since this is important, let’s consider the subject itself in the end.
I’ve been talking about the things that I’ve done in this life insurance policy.
They include that the fund management should take care of the interests of the fund partners and have a moral criterion in investment, and these issues are carried out in more detail in the agreements of both the Guldis and the Life Insurance Fund of the businessmen as I mentioned.
Life insurance funds, on the other hand, do NOT have to look only at short-term earnings perspectives in their investments.
This would be a very risky strategy, and there is no need to look long for examples of such in the past, since large loans from banks and funds have flown into immoral adventures and environmental scrutiny, with terrible consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on a high note when he was thinking of wiping out a whole group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the well-being that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time reveals whether it is appropriate for the investment of life insurance funds in the company to be accountable to the fund companies when it is set up.

One of the infected didn’t have a home infection.
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic States on the 15th of July, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not normally resident here and therefore did not receive clear instructions on keeping so-called home visits after communing to the country and going to another sampling a few days after communing.
He got a negative out of the border screen.
“But he is in the Icelandic community and really should go to that remedy,” says Kamilla J<0xC3><0xB3>sepsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the field of contraception at Landdoctor and a local contraceptive doctor while he is on summer leave, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the course is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the later sample.”
She says the man has been able to use the English registration form because he is actually a resident abroad but because of his relationship in the country as an Icelander he should have used it in Icelandic.
However, he did not understand this.
“When the lecture is not recorded, you need to make sure that you come to the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that it was the right way,” Kamilla said.
“So it’s clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to make an automated preaching system even though Icelanders don’t register their ID.
Or do it somehow to make it clearer who are the participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Unfortunately, the person concerned does not have to communicate with the country even though he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, a resident Icelander.
Only six have been sent to the search after he was discovered yesterday and all six were in contact with him.
They are due to be sampled, but two of them are starting to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla probably says he was recently infected with the virus that she had not yet been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
"It's not entirely possible to assume that this is certainly imported because it's long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused little difference in relation to the sporting events."
She says it's very unlikely because of the way the man gets around here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but points out that it can’t be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has finished analyzing the virus in humans.
“If we get a type of virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain he’s brought it to the country.”
Piper sprays and explosives applied against countermeasures
There was an attack between the police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police raided the protesters with pepper spray and innocuous hand blasts, but the protesters broke the bars and ignited.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were stabbed.
Police violence and racial discrimination were widely protested in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one of the protesters was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to the construction site and broke ruins in the city's courthouse.
Later, the police said the protests were unscathed and there were attacks between groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain was a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, at least by protesters.
The car ran through a group of protesters in the city, but no one failed.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Guard gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police at her home in March last year.
The group carried firearms and went to the districts to closed street protests where police assigned the group from a group of people who opposed the protests and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters recalled James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white barista in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final round of the English national team.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose to the Wolves, Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r and his men end up in 5th place and lose there with the Champions League seat.
Then they should still hope to get into the Champions League by winning the European Championship next month.
“We’re not at the end.
“If we get to the point against Leicester, I think people will say we’re not having a bad time now,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
“But whatever happens then, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to reach the teams two ahead of us,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
It’s clear that people’s nerves will be silenced at 3 p.m. today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to pretend that each other’s game was about to be played.
“If you want to join Manchester United, you have to get used to being pressured in the last game of the season.
It’s nothing new, and that’s what the company is building on.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is ours to take advantage of it," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
"It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many moments to define this period."
"Come Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think we are in better shape and will be stronger mentally than in the last period," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
65,000 sunflowers
A total of 65,490 new cases of the coronavirus have been diagnosed in the United States, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the western sea since the beginning of the outbreak in the country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days there were more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the U.S. anti-terrorism forecast, the number of deaths due to the virus will be 175,000 on August 15th.
Afraid of the second wave
Governments in Spain are now trying to keep up with the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country by the weak.
Spanish health authorities have reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more detections in one day since the beginning of May, and the questions come at the same time as Spain begin to dismiss one of the strangest export bans in Europe.
The backlash led to the British authorities now obliging passengers coming from Spain to go to the airport on their return.
A week ago, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the north-east of Spain as the authorities have taken steps to broader restrictions to try to match the level of growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and old houses will be closed at midnight.
The export ban is now in force for 200,000 people in the county of Segria in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain’s decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is very upset about the arrival of foreign tourists and is a bad game after the invasion.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but little interest appears to be in rethinking the large-scale export ban that has largely devastated the chemical industry.
Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, has taken very badly such and similarly to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the people “would not be killed, financially or socially,” should they be arrested once again for export bans nationwide.
It is hoped that many counselors for the local resource that reaches the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or areas will be able to hold back the virus in the next circulation if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestically
Three domestic cases were identified yesterday, as well as two additional cases at the border.
In Iceland, five people were diagnosed with a positive Covid-19 infection yesterday.
In a press release, it says that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football match.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in a search.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of the sports association in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k and is, according to the announcement, "the only part of the sports conference" in the application.
Others who were sent in were in trouble related to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is undetectable and infectious in full swing in the infective accounts of the State Police Directorate.
The opponents of the ReyCUP have followed the guidelines and rules of the pediatrician and general practitioners that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, yesterday’s photos of the event attracted attention, as it was possible to see in a very close concert to celebrate the good direction of his team out on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the recipients posted the following notification on their Facebook page.
It says “ATH: Parents please respect the rules for competitors to pick up their own dolls at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection that was reported last night.
According to the report, “Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before.”
Infectious diseases are also being investigated and are the ones infected in isolation and 12 in contagion due to the infection.
The third case is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He appeared in the south-west corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in search of him.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of a viral infection.
In addition, two have been identified at the border and are awaited for the result of further research such as a toolkit in cross-border infections.
Finally, the report states: The Department of Public Prosecution of the National Police and the Office of the Regional Physician instructs people to be careful and considerate of personalised anti-infectious agents.
Play the least doubt on whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present is the same one asked to go for a sampling at the next health care center.
Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur says the campsite booked about the weekend of the shoppers - Directs the guests to another
The camp site at Patreksfir<0xC3><0xB0>i is booked for the weekend, according to the announcement by Westurbygg<0xC3><0xB0>ar.
Guests are advised to check out other accommodation options.
Names Westurbygg<0xC3><0xB0> B<0xC3><0xAD>ldudal, T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Melanes <0xC3><0xA1> Red<0xC3><0xB0>asand, Hotel Flokalund and Hotel Breidav<0xC3><0xAD>k as other options in the area.
There is plenty to be at Patreksfir<0xC3><0xB0> this weekend, because like last year, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic folklore will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has therefore become a strong tradition in the city.
On the grounds of the camp area to be judged, a good meeting can be expected this year, if the weather does not set strict account, but the DV said earlier today from a derivation prediction.
However, you can expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for the Patriots.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodation in the town was already booked.
A whole multi-family house caved down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely on Dunhaga 18–20.
While the owners are applying for a building permit for renovation, their assets have grown in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, there is a three-storey townhouse.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
The back of the house is the door of two staircases, each containing four rather spacious apartments.
They are in the range of 93–130 square meters, but most are over 100.
The house has a remarkable history to store.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rentals, Sk<0xC3><0xB3>stofuna, Melkkursams<0xC3><0xB3>llena dairy, J<0xC3><0xB3>a pissusmi<0xC3><0xB0>, fish sales and now the last Universit<0xC3><0xA1>rio.
The house, so lightly taken to words, has remembered its vivid beauty.
The house is now under great damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company list among others Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sson and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s went for the ownership group of Borgunar and was a defender of the holding company of Borgunar.
In the group owned by the holding company Borgunar, St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf.
St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf. is Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>nar Helgu L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and her children’s investment company.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n is also the owner of a third party in D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n and her husband, August Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once built a steel ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has so little to no maintenance since then.
Tell the neighbors that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, though mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook page of residents of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house "has not been particularly lively in recent years".
It can be recorded that the owners have been looking for a few years after changing the house and the lot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been well for a long time.
“It’s a long time to do something common with this moment and it’s boring that it’s slowed down like this.”
He also says that he's mad at the owner of the house for not trying to finish this, found some common thread with the neighbours of the house, and quit this "legislative step".
“Just do this in consultation with the community around you so you can rush into this and finish it.”
The "legislative stage" to which the resident refers is the organisational process of the circuit that has been in operation since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then sued for permission to build a floor above the existing townhouse and behind the house, a new elevator and a one-story building as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was applied to the Environmental and Resources Committee and the Committee revoked it, since the implementation was not intended to be part of a shared arrangement and the reporting was not satisfactory.
Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k City then started with a divisional organization work and ended it with an announcement in the Board of Directors in July last year.
That arrangement was also approved and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this time, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house were on the initial floor.
At that time, the house had fallen down considerably and the neighbours began to get tired.
When the DV asked the neighbours of the house about the situation and the reaction of the neighbours were the responses in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Some people get angry at the city, others don’t.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily out to anyone.
Still others said the car parks had a three-wheeler, but the neighbours had a new unused Dunhaga 18-20 parking lot under their vehicles.
A loved one in the case said long-term fatigued at the board:
“It’s unbelievable that we’re going to have to go through the trilogy.
“It’s like the city doesn’t read.”
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A memorial to the city’s similar administration and the generous intentions of the owner and the many years of work of those who are now in the starting line.
When a reporter took to a park in Dunhaga 18, a door opened and a garbage can opened.
Playstation computers and recent televisions are in the midst of another mess on earth — the victims of Iceland’s summer blues.
It was opened into the old office of the University of Applied Sciences and there numerous cats of the hamlet to judge.
It is clear that someone has been wandering around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stack of beds and beds, and some boards of geological journals, which are likely to have to be booked, blow with.
The staircases of the apartment house were equally open and life in both.
The reporter was so lucky to have a crush on their fellow citizens.
The Romans were there to have a potato dish for dinner and invited the reporter in.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there about some kind of storm and military authorities DV that the company has paid nothing for the housing except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house does not seem defensible to collect rent.
From the posts on the back of the house to the judgement, it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers at the last masses.
The staff leasing system has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, the end of the contraction in tourism has led to the contraction in the construction industry and these two industries have been what makes the most efficient use of the services of the staff leasing.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do, and the workshops and workshops in the community were held on Tuesday after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the dire condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well-maintained.
When a journalist sneezed the Romanian boys, his nickname suddenly became clear to him: At the best place in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, 1,500 square meters of real estate stands down.
Owners want to change the house to repair and neighbours want to improve the condition, but share the definition of "refurbished".
Between this, the city’s planning area sits on the starting line, the sacrifice of endless aspirations and tenderness in the organisational process and the similarity of the resolution of the Environmental and Resources Committee.
In the house live such Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the weekly DV on July 17.
In the treatment of overweight following coronary artery disease
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will allocate <0xC2><0xA3>10m in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast-track ads, following his serious deterioration, partly because of his weight.
Johnson is expected to present the campaign, which has been dubbed Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their overweight shelters and will also be attacked in an attack on multiple cycles.
Advertisements for instant messaging on television will then be banned by 9 p.m., according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has raised us against the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we need to take the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier food,” the spokesman said.
Johnson himself has dealt with a weight problem to fight, but he was put on bail when he was infected with the coronavirus this spring, and it is partly his weight because he is thought to have suffered so seriously.
Women are more likely to lead the changes.
She said the new government’s agenda was the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater power-sharing, transparency, and working against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gears a little now and who is better at bringing about such changes than the group of society that should be easier to be in these values.
There are women," said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their femininity.
To stand together and to be together in leading change.
So now it’s time for us to make these changes.”
She said she was a bit reluctant to focus on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not ready to see what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the lines of the group.
We don’t all have the same rules here,” said Helga.
She said that women are in many ways good things in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Icelanders are building at a grossly masculine value.
She said that the government turned to form its own interests, sovereignty, and power that would be the powers that would uphold injustice in all societies.
“Women are now ready to form this group and come together and are just getting a little irritated about the fact that the Parliament is going to move forward to look past this 2012 national referendum,” she said.
“It’s the feminine values that we’re thinking about.
"Out of human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we are all really at the same table," she said, adding that the above values were the basic values of the new government.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources, and it is absurd to have people living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can change things differently," said Helga.
“It’s ridiculous that it’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always paid lower.
It’s absurd that flight attendants and nurses need to be in a civil war indefinitely just to achieve a humane reward.”
The signatory to the new government can be signed here via e-Iceland.
Trying to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of narcotics in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>, where two were arrested for the matter.
Then the police stopped the motorbike driver in Hl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x91>un, where the driver was at a speed of 146 km, where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving rights.
Police in the capital’s area had enough to turn in tonight and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise due to the noise.
On Saturday night, there were reports of eleven noise-induced incidents, and this was widely reported in the police diary.
Last night, however, there were 22 noises on the board of the police.
Six of them were held in custody last night.
In <0xC3><0x81>rbenum, police were called into the night when the parties shot down airstrikes.
However, they were ready to escape when the policemen were walking into the park.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for burglary and/or drug abuse.
Four of them were arrested for clashes in the city centre last night and one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Then two were transported to the emergency room after they fell on the face, one in the center and the other in the West Bank.
One was transported to an accident department after he failed to jump on a trampoline in Copenhagen.
In addition, the police officer stopped the driver who drove a caravan on Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to a police diary, the wheelchair of the car was in “very bad condition” and was stationed.
You can stay at Monet's house for the weekend.
The house, in which the Impressionist Claude Monet spent his last forty years of practice, is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are about the weekend of the shopkeepers.
The house is small and cuddly, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
In the house there are three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, they will have to rent at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb site, it will be available next week, on the Sunday of the shopper’s weekend, and so it might be ideal for some holiday shoppers to rush into booking the painter’s house.
The two nights over the weekend of the businessman cost no more than 964 U.S. dollars, or just as much as 130,000 ISK, depending on what the Newspaper says next.
Tens of people are infected and some of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have become infected because of this and some of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at a border inspection.
A specialist at a local doctor’s office says that a growing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in the community.
“There has been a series of analyses from the previous domestic survey and there is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has recently come to the country, but of course we need to be very well on guard now," said Kamilla Sigr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>ur J<0xC3><0xB3>sefsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the field of contraception of the official national doctor.
Most of the infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will be carried out next year than some who have been associated with the infected are beginning to show symptoms of the corona virus.
“There is currently no flu and less than other respiratory infections, so we can be quite free to do these tests on individuals who, at the time of the flu, would have found reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
The infection is mostly over, but it is not ruled out that more people need to go to the infection.
Two of the victims were diagnosed after attending an athletic event.
It has raised questions about whether it is appropriate to hold such an event.
The Director of Public Communications says it well as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
Kamilla says almost exclusively that the infected have been infected at the sporting events.
“If there is no more insulation from these individuals after having handled them at these sporting events, then we can continue to maintain that our defenses on the circuits have worked.
“It’s not clear,” Kamilla said.
The Department of Public Safety’s work is under constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if there seems to be an occasion," Kamilla said.
In just over a week, the number of restrictions will be extended to thousands of people.
This new position may have an impact on the outcomes.
“Certain Thoughts on Cooking” – See Elise Vidar’s Meal
El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir is a former female footballer and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
It requires a lot of energy for the duration of the day and usually gives itself time to cook good and nutritious food.
A normal day for me begins by coming to work out of eight,” says Elisa.
“After work, I’m going to the store to be able to prepare dinner before I get my girlfriend to play school at three o’clock.”
Elise finds it very nutritious to pick up her daughter early in school.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice for the second game.
After the exercise it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we feel good watching one episode to empty the mind."
Eliza does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting a final hand on a masterpiece in nutrition, and she knows well what she can eat to have enough energy to do her job, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well-combined with protein, carbohydrates and fat.
However, I think it is more important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious foods.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Elaine is very interested in cooking.
“I think it’s a good idea to stay in the kitchen to cook and take a lot of it.
I have to say that self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Toast this meal with what’s available every time.
Most of the time it is bananas and mosquitoes & caffeine.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Millimal: Incredibly uneven, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, clean jackets with bananas and muslins, bread with nuts and so on I could eat hummus with a spoon out of the box if applicable.
Lunch: I often get all sorts of great salads from what’s in the fridge, Chinese or barley, falafel bowls, rock salad, baked vegetables with good dressing is a little bit of what I’m working with.
If the arrangement goes completely out of the bushes (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has saved me a lot of time and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, do not put more on you.
Minimum: Get me something rich in carbohydrates for workouts, breads with nuts, cereals or fruits.
Dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice of my home, otherwise some delicious veggies.
Conflict Between Police and Protesters in Seattle
City authorities in Seattle, Washington state, have declared a state of insurrection in the wake of mass protests in the city centre.
Police yesterday seized explosives and pipes to try to eradicate a large area that protesters had laid siege to and stretched over many of the houses near the city’s congressional building.
Police said on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation into the damage done at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of explosion.
The city and police authorities say the protesters had found the police with sludge, bottles, shells and other explosives and were transported to a hospital where his injuries were made.
However, the protests in Seattle were peacefully ahead of them.
The blast was for them to show protesters in Portland, Oregon, but there has been a hard-fought attack in the city between protesters and the heavily armed rural state police.
There, like in other cities in the United States, people gather under the sign of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protesting systemic racism in the American community and demanding redress.
Not revoked until after the vote has been cast
It is not yet clear whether their cancellations by Icelandair, which are due to take effect next month, will be revoked.
Icelandair’s electronic voting fee for the Icelandic Air Freight Association’s charter agreement will be closed at noon this morning.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, the chairman of the association, says Icelandair will not take a decision on the resignations until the result of the vote.
“It’s a great combination,” says Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney.
“There have been no cancellations, this has to be done so that the machines can be manned.
So, of course, people are intimidated to find out if there will be work after the menstrual cycle.”
The deal was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract that air traffic controllers had previously included in the voting fee.
On 17 July, Icelandair’s Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of the Icelandic Air Freight Association approved the announcement of an all-inclusive stoppage, and members approved it in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair’s decision to cease negotiations with the airline, to terminate all of its flight options and to seek contracts with another airline.
At that time, the airline’s pilots had to take on the job of security guards on board on a temporary basis.
Ask how she believes the vote will go, says Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney, it is difficult to say about it.
“People are hurt by this Icelandair application, when all the airline’s flight schedules were cancelled and announced that they would agree with another airline.
Now it becomes clear whether it has an impact,” she says.
At the end of April, Icelandair operated 940 aircraft, with 900 of them, about 95%, said.
Their resignation period is incorrect, with the person who has the shortest term of employment being three months and ends around the month of July-August.
In this group there are about 90% of Icelandair flights.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
“We are looking forward to continuing our discussions with our partners.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he's refused, it's clear that the flight attendants seem to have gone too far."
The vote on the agreement ends and Icelandair announces the settlement of the second quarter of the year tomorrow
The voting fee for the new charter agreement ends at 12 a.m. tomorrow morning.
Icelandair’s statement for the second quarter will also be released tomorrow, with preliminary results suggesting that the company’s revenues have fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The e-voting ceremony for the Icelandic Air Freight Association and the Icelandic Workers’ Association (ICAO) kicked off on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 noon.
The persons eligible to vote for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay a company fee to the Norwegian Air Freight Association.
Icelandair and FF<0xC3><0x8D> signed a new agreement on Sunday night, July 19, but on Friday, Icelandair had negotiated with the company after air traffic controllers collated the previous agreement in a ballot in early July.
At the time, Icelandair had told all of the airline's flights and flights on Friday but they were withdrawn after a new charter agreement was signed.
According to the new charter agreement, flight attendants need to fly five more hours a month for the same basis.
The charter agreement is valid until 2025, but it has already integrated the rules of the pilots and the flight schedule on how long to fly on a single watch.
The deal was presented to FF<0xC3><0x8D> members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last month and described many air traffic jams that news outlets discussed with them about dissatisfaction with the deal.
However, most seemed to agree that it would have to accept the agreement to keep FF<0xC3><0x8D> alive.
Icelandair’s earnings for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company’s EBIT, its operating income for financial and tax purposes, is negative, according to the preliminary findings, at around US$100 million to US$110 million or around US$15 billion.
Icelandair sent an indicative balance sheet to the company last Wednesday, where it said the company's revenues had amounted to about $60 million in the quarter or about $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, the amount of cash and its equivalent was about 154 million U.S. dollars, at around 21 billion kroner.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair is set to conclude contracts with fifteen charterers, the government, and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before it enters into a share bid.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“The new virus just means that it has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been wrong here in the country," says M<0xC3><0xA1>r Kristj<0xC3><0xA1>nsson, a senior doctor at the Lands<0xC3><0xAD>pitalan's Infectious Disease Department, about the fact that a "new type of virus" has been detected here in the country.
Three domestic cases were identified yesterday and two at the border.
One who was found to have participated in the association of the sports company at the Rey Cup football match, but the origin of the infection is unknown and infectious.
A person who arrived in the country on 15 July and two others who were in contact with him were also diagnosed with symptoms of COVID-19.
Then yesterday, an infection related to an infection reported last Wednesday and after a series of analysis in the Icelandic genetic analysis, a “new type of virus that has not been detected here before” was discovered.
Infection is completed in connection with the infection.
It is already noted that it is not a new virus, but it is the same virus and has spread worldwide, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variant of the virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it meant and if it could say anything about the start of another wave of globalization, it says But as if it is a single incident to be discussed and it could go so nothing more out of it.
“However, if there are domestic cases that are not related from abroad and are of the same genetic origin as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw those conclusions [of the second wave], but it is not timely for such support,” explains M<0xC3><0xA1>r.
Happiness in the hot pot
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC’s Daily Recorders lead the dead in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hotspot culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and is filled with the fact that nowhere in the world are there as many baths per inhabitant.
The natural warming is the basis of it, but also the tradition of swimming that reigns here.
Children’s swimming education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are nevertheless eligible to use hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as an integral part of the overall well-being of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of position and position.
Resolved with mobile phones, people discuss personal notes about home and space or enjoy the similar power of water: reflecting and charging batteries of souls and bodies.
A hundred days to go to the polls
There are a hundred days until Americans go to the polls and elect a four-year-old president.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he is on the verge of re-election.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s expected protagonist, has a lot ahead of Trump at the national level, being centered around the viewers.
According to a recent survey by the AP News Agency, the U.S. meta-number believes the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s response to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular and there are also more Americans than before the president’s misconduct in economic matters.
More specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump’s response to the coup and 48 percent say he has done well in economic matters.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump is 41.9 percent nationally.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performance against the Biden assassination, push for so-called cultural divisions, and proclaim policies that are to be turned to laws and rules.
Biden’s supply, however, puts a lot of competition to keep Trump’s attention and counts as more likely to win if the election is really about how Trump has stood up in office over the past four years.
Trump’s innocence also seems to be going down on Republican congressmen and fears that Democrats might even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far been highly qualified.
Politico said in recent days that the following categories and propositions were kept comparable and that now the Republican Party would have its greatest success in a decade.
The situation has proved particularly bad for the group in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now there is an expectation that this development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare outcasts into following him, including by saying that if he becomes President Biden, he will tear down the outskirts of the United States and push down racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the outskirts.
Then he encouraged the “mothers” of the U.S. outpost to read an article about the former deputy governor of New York, in which she argued that Biden would destroy the U.S. outposts and took over Trump.
“The prayer will ruin your disappearances and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it better,” the president said.
The population of the United States is an ever-increasing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has won the majority of this group’s votes has become president.
Not until 2012, when Mitt Romney won the majority of the vote from the group, but lost to Barack Obama.
The polls have shown that even though Trump secured a majority in the U.S. in 2016, his follow-up has been significantly reduced.
Although there are differences between the polls, Biden has recommended about fifteen percent of Trump’s advances in the polls in the past.

Will the Olympic torch be the light at the end of the hallway?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event which only World Wars have made possible, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Games would be celebrated as the "light of the world at the end of the races," and that the Olympic Games would be celebrated as the "light of the world at the end of the races."
People have an extra year to prepare and the authorities in Japan to increase the cost due to the delay.
Everyone has a big head in their head.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue of this year’s Olympic Games, the celebrations of Japanese representatives were unsuccessful.
They cried and laughed in exchange, eventually Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 games, but said that this time in the lower hold for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan should bathe in the world’s attention.
The games are scheduled to run from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year and will start on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If there is no text to keep the players then, if the coronavirus is still too much of a threat, the games will be stopped.
No one wants to think about it at the end.
The Olympic Games are not an ordinary sporting event.
Nothing is to be saved, the show should always be great and strive to top the last game.
The choice of a city for the Olympics is based on the assessment of the election committee on the presentations of the cities.
The grander the presentation is —the more likely it is to bite the knot.
Tokyo earned $150 million to try to hold the 2016 Olympic Games, or which is worth a whopping 20 billion kroner.
The next time, when the 2020 games were applied, $75 million, or about 10 billion kroner, was put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the toys this year, the Japanese authorities had thus protected, which took 30 billion kroner for the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean considering the cost of building an Olympic village, a playground and in general strengthening the country’s infrastructure to tackle such a tournament, prepare it and keep the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be in progress these days but have been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by Japan’s state inspectorate at the end of last year found that the cost was almost double that number.
It may not be possible to make a full estimate of the cost of delaying the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
There are so many figures that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state only accounted for about half of the Olympic Games, compared to the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such a magnitude that they have become the subject of debate by economists, who try to figure out the numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
At the very least, many have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is less positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
Some dosing effects are, for example, a large number of jobs very much for a short period of time, but for a longer period of time cities tend to sit up with debt gaps and the threat of low operating costs of employed people.
Rio, Brazil, has been in serious debt for the 2016 games and has been struggling to cost maintenance on all of the major sports facilities built for the players.
According to figures from the London 2012 Games, only 10 percent of those who got a job at the city's Olympic Games were unemployed in the past.
This means that it was not about a new job except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not made a particularly good profit from maintaining the Olympic Games financially due to the sluggish cost that accompanies the human resources built for the players.
The benefit, however, is probably included in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, although there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2021 Games.
It is also not clear whether it will be possible to accommodate all the number of viewers who usually download the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor that the cities seem to be elected, but it is difficult to value for money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players move is not the nature of being able to put on it prizes.
But although the show is very large and there is nothing to save, it’s not just about money.
It’s the athletes that are at the forefront.
For some fans, it’s surprising that it’s just welcome to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five-stroke woman and gold medalist Chloe Esposito, in her article on the site of the Olympics, is a cassole and would have been a far cry this summer but hopes to be in competitive form for the 2021 games.
She is, therefore, among those athletes who are just rather satisfied with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit after the games this year, if they had been held at the right time, the delay of the games in some cases means that they quit the competition before the games take place.
Just don’t trust your body to go through years in addition to strenuous workouts.
A few athletes were equally impressed in the hearts of spectators of the 2016 Rio Olympics and the five-star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold rings around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She plans to play the games in 2021, but she is not sure if she will still be at the top of the games next year, eventually she will turn 24.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is in the higher order for a fiftieth wife in the foreground.
“This is a sensitive issue,” says Biles, but smiles in another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asking if she intends to reach the 2021 games as much as she did in Rio 2016.
“I don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after an entire year in addition to training,” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body is not able to withstand the stress that comes with fidgeting training much longer.
However, she still competes for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop exercising suddenly when the world war was at its peak and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles but others while all sports activities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympians could not buy any access above the others, she needed to find various ways to keep herself in shape like others.
The basic shape is certainly better than that of most people.
“We have a tough schedule right now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the fiftieth story opened.
We started slowly, but we’ve come to a whole new level and I’ll increase the workouts equally and tightly depending on how it feels this year.
Of course, we don’t know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice given that they will be, we can’t do anything else.
I’ve put too much pressure on myself to quit the sport now,” says Biles.
With it, like many other eyes, there is, or perhaps rather, the awareness that that position can arise that the players will not be held at all in 2021 but rather.
Predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games as they will be held for a year.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covid gangs.
The wedding has been postponed due to delays.
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other important things to think about right now,” the actress said in an interview with People.
“We definitely want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all the people who are dear to us.
But we decided to put it on schedule and focus on what is important right now and it’s helping to share information about the importance of wearing a makeup and staying at home.
I’m looking more at the world of weddings these days.
There is a lot going on and we need to focus our attention on what is happening in the world.”
