Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid of "looking like a bow"
The proposal to change their titles to Member of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) has caused concern among some members of parliament.
This concern arose from a plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House of Representatives in the political spectrum are concerned that the name may be ridiculous.
One Labour Party member said he was concerned that the party's name was "concerned with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: "twp" in Galceda means crazy, and "pwp" means to cacao.
A member of the Plaid Party proposed an alternative, stating that the parties in the party were generally "not mine".
While one of the members of the Gal Conservative Party said he was "open-minded" about the party's name change, he said there was a little word play from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the letter "w" in Galicia is pronounced like the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting a bill that will make name changes, said: “The final decision on defining what the members of the Assembly will of course belong to the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 recognized the right to change its name to the Welsh Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public opinion poll on proposals that saw great support for the naming of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the titles of members of parliament, the Commission was in favour of Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), while the MWP title was the most supported option in public opinion.
Members of the legislature are clearly suggesting different options, but reaching consensus could hurt the head of House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill on the changes in the coming weeks.
The law on innovations will also include some changes in the form of the assembly's work, including the removal of members from the assembly and rules such as the order of the committee system.
Members will make their final decisions as to what name they will take when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will hold a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on whether to change the name of their countries to “North Macedonia” on Sunday.
This referendum was launched in order to end decades of disagreements with Greece, the neighbouring country of a region called Macedonia.
Athens has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO, insisting that its northern neighbor’s name be on the territory for a long time.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the name change, said he would not consider voting.
But those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a fee to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Rings Turned Silent Like the Churches in the Harlem Problem
Adams said, "The old people I'm talking to say there's a bar and a church in every corner in time."
"They're not both anymore."
Adams said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now people are socializing in different ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood halls where people go regularly."
As for the churches, Adams is concerned that the money gained by selling goods will not last as long as the leaders expected, and that "they will sooner or later return to where they started."
He also added that the type of apartments where people live would replace churches that would not help the remaining churches of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who live in these apartments will be white, so it will always speed up the closure of all the churches together, because it's not possible that most of the people who move to these apartments are members of these churches," he said.
The two churches were built in Harlem in 1870 by the Metropolitan Community, and ten years later by white congregations before becoming the black metropolis of St. Martin's.
The original White Methodist congregation was relocated in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshipping around took possession of the building.
Reverend John Howard Johnson led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a main street used for shopping in Harlem, which was opposed to hiring and promoting blacks. He took over St. Martin from a black community led by him.
A fire that broke out in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's clerks ordered a bell set because they planned to rebuild the building.
Father Johnson's son and successor, Reverend David Johnson of St. Martin, proudly described the bell ringer as "the bells of poor people."
The expert who played the bells in July gave the team another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an unprecedented historic vehicle."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this team was the first bell to be played by a black musician in the world. This musician was Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger bell team at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin didn't take anyone's place.
What’s been happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story in which some of the church’s non-church leaders play a role by the architects and contractors found in the diocese.
The church’s governing body, which is made up of non-religious leaders, sent a message to the bishops in July, although the council did not have a share in keeping the architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some in the congregation were close to lack of transparency in the church.
In California, a shark hurts a 13-year-old boy who dives to catch lobster.
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California who was diving to catch lobster on the day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. on the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that half an hour after he started diving with his friends on Saturday morning, he heard the boy screaming for help and went to him with a group of boats to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that the child was excited to find lobster, but later he realized that he was yelling, "He bit me, he bit me!"
said.
When Hammel went to see the child, he said, "The whole bone of his skull was open."
"I told everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was found to be critical.
The type of attacking shark is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told the press that a dogfish was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim had traumatic wounds on his upper body.
Authorities have closed access to beaches in the area, from the Ponto coast in Casablad for 48 hours on grounds of investigation and security, to the Swami coast in Ecinitas.
Giles said there were about 135 species of dogfish in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s includes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with its department store-style beauty districts and expert staff.
As Britain’s fashion and household goods sales continue to grow as part of its strong entry into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, 11 larger cosmetics stores across the country will be tested and more will be in store next year if it succeeds.
The investment in cosmetics comes from supermarkets looking for ways to fill the shelves that are divided into televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury’s said the number of cosmetics brands including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr.PawPaw will find 3000 for the first time.
Brands ranging from L'Oreal to Maybelline and Burt's Bees, such as the ones found in stores like Boots, will find more places.
At the same time, the supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup line to become increasingly sought-after vegan products by young customers.
Fragrance Shop, a fragrance retailer, will also be located in two Sainsbury’s stores in Croydon, South London, and another in Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
Along with my focus on shopping online and doing daily grocery shopping from small local stores, supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe said the supermarket chain will look more and more like department stores to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores offering more non-food service.
Since Sainsbury's bought the two chains two years ago, it has placed Argos stands in hundreds of stores, including some Habitat stands, which it says supports market sales and increases its profits.
The previous attempt to renovate the supermarket’s cosmetics and pharmacy department had failed.
Sainsbury's tried to open a joint store with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how pharmacies in supermarkets shared their income.
Sainsbury's 281-store pharmacy business emerged after a new strategy was launched three years ago after it sold <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is said to play a role in the plan by adding luxury skincare brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetic regions to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available to advise.
Our brand range has been designed to meet every need, and our attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are a cosmetics salesman that pushes the old shopping style.”
Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal "hates" Peter Jones
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left the show "angryly" over Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's homewear and accessories brand really has no time to spare.
The work of the two was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old server of This Morning has left the show on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby hired Dragons' Den star Peter Jones to focus on her new lucrative contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, leaving the lifestyle brand business at the last minute.
According to sources, Marlow, the television's golden daughter, on Tuesday, admitted at a tense meeting in the heart of his business empire in Buckinghamshire that the <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million new deals no longer meant that there was enough time for True to separate the home clothing and accessories brands.
The company was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to have doubled Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he had left Truly, while Jones set out on a jet to go to one of his vacation homes outside the UK.
A source said: “Truely Holly was the first with a clear gap between priorities.
He would have a long-term future that would support him over the next 20 years.
Holly's decision to withdraw completely shocked everyone involved.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse at Marlow HQ full of ready-to-sell goods."
One of the UK’s most popular stars, experts say, is the fact that the server’s journey from pillows to candles, serious investments in a variety of products, and the potential for delays in the launch of the company’s This Morning program.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The three children's mother Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016. Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be M&S’s brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin, the host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business issues."
It was a tough conversation, "When we fell in love"
He joked about the comments some would find "anti-presidential" and the criticisms he would receive from the media for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump proposed a "news server" and responded with the following:
"I didn't give up on anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called the first call for talks in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have been disrupted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday that the United States did not see a “opposite response” to North Korea’s previous disarmament moves to world leaders at the UN General Assembly.
Instead, he said the U.S. continued its sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump showed a much more optimistic attitude at the meeting.
"It's great between us and North Korea," he said.
“We would go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a wonderful relationship now.”
He said the development of his relationship with Kim has brought positive results, such as the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the rest of the U.S. troops to their homes.
He also advocated his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
Trump pointed to the crowd in front of him, “It’s very easy to treat the president in a decent way, but if 10,000 people try to get into this narrow area, there’s 200 people standing here.”
Tsunami and earthquake hit Indonesian island, hundreds of people killed
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said that foreign civil society organizations were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is local, no national disaster report has been made, which is a precondition for facilitating international aid.
Sumbung said, "Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international help, which is why the situation is difficult."
While Save the Children is setting up a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether the foreign team will be able to work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said he was evaluating the situation in Palu to see if Indonesian officials would be allowed to contribute to international aid efforts.
Considering that Indonesia is constantly exposed to earthquakes, the country is unfortunately not prepared enough for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters are being built in Aceh, there are no such studies on other coasts.
Although a warning has been issued in Palu, the absence of tsunami warning sirens is likely to have led to the loss of life.
Even at its best, it is difficult to travel between many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more treacherous.
A hospital ship spoken in Lombok to treat the earthquakes is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area affected by the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made it the most important part of his campaign to improve Indonesia’s depleted infrastructure, spending a lot of money on highways and railroads.
However, funding the shortcomings forced Joko's administration to re-election next year.
Joko is also faced with the pressure arising from the sectarian conflict in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative belief.
Conflicts by Christian and Muslim gangs on the street using knives, arrows, and other primitive weapons led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands of people from their homes.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge scored a goal against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved his 89th minute goalkeeper at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal while the team was 1-0 behind.
After taking the ball slightly to the left, he pulled the shot towards the far pole.
He flew over the penalty area as he headed for the upper right side of the castle.
Kepa Arrizabalaga, who finally jumped the ball, burst into tears.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com, "I was just trying to take the ball and find the position. Players like Shaq always go as far as they can. I tried to earn as much time as I could."
"When I saw Kante come, I touched him once, and I shot him without thinking too much."
In the 25th minute with Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea finished the first half 1-0 ahead.
The Blues' forvet gave Mateo Kovacic a kick in the game before running from midfield to Liverpool's semi-field.
Kovacic made a quick give in the midfield.
Then he took Hazard to the penalty spot by giving him a nice break.
Hazard passed the defense and threw the ball in the back tears with a shot past Liverpool player Alisson Becker with his left foot.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the Champions League group match at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will face Videoton in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll in Indonesia tsunami has risen to 832.
The Indonesian emergency response agency said the death toll in the tsunami had risen to 832 in the early hours of Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative, said at a press conference that many people were reported to be under the building crater in the earthquake that hit the country on Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, causing the earthquake to form waves at a height of 20 feet.
With a population of more than 380,000, the city of Palu was filled with debris from the destroyed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman with a knife
This morning, Birkenhead opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police force has asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything about the incident to appear.
Investigator Brian O'Hagan said: "At the initial stage of the investigation, but I'm calling on anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious that was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us.
I also call on them to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something with their vehicle road cameras."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman who found the body was a native of Birkenhead and that the woman was in a private property.
This afternoon, some friends, who thought they knew the woman, came to the scene of the incident this morning and asked questions about where the man was.
Investigations are ongoing as the police say they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to enter his apartment but police said no one was allowed to be inside or outside the building.
When he found out what was going on, the driver's tongue got stuck.
It has now been said that it will take hours for those who live in the house to be allowed back into their homes.
It was reported that a police officer told another man that the entire area was now a crime scene.
At the scene of the incident, an old woman appeared.
The woman kept repeating, "What's happened is so terrible."
Two police vans were inside the cordon at 2 p.m. while the other was just outside the cordon.
Several police officers were standing inside the cordon and overseeing the apartment buildings.
Anyone with the information is asked to write privately to <0x40>MerPolCC or call 101 or contact 0800 555 111, which is a private and secret crime arrest line, without giving a name, is quoted from 247 of the September 30 diary.
The Cromwell statue in front of the assembly was the last target monument in the "re-write of history" debate
The removal of the statue would be a divine justice for Cromwell's fanatical pyrite followers, as many cultural and religious works in England have been destroyed by the Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “stupid” and “starting to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "The current debate over the removal of statues has inevitably led to the targeting of the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not realize the iconic fragility of the British civil wars, nor did these wars take place at his command.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed instead of Thomas, his ancestor from the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of Cromwell's 19th-century view. Also, Cromwell is a figure that many people still consider worthy of celebration, part of his history writing.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “For many, Cromwell is seen as an advocate of the monarchy, in his case, of the assembly, much more against external pressures than it is today, perhaps in the 19th century.
It is a continuing historical debate as to whether this is exactly a statement.
What is certain is that the dispute in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation after this event, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents a part of this dispute.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Swine Screwed Until Killed Chinese Farmer
According to a local media report, one of the farmers was attacked and killed in a collision in southwestern China.
According to the South China Morning Post on Sunday, the man identified with only his surname “Yuan” was found in a blood-covered manner near the adjacent pig barn in Liupanshui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, a pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs with a pig brain.
According to reports, the man and his cousin set out to sell 15 pigs from the neighbouring state of Greece on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and noticed that the door of a nearby pig's brain was open.
His cousin said there was a big male pig in his mouth in the blood.
The forensic examination report confirmed that a giant pig weighing 550 pounds had been stabbed to death by a farmer.
According to the Guiyang Main News, his cousin, called "Wu," said: "My cousin's legs were in blood, he was crushed."
Security camera footage shows Yuan coming in Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
The body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's pig.
While police were gathering evidence at the scene, one of the protesters told Ana Haber that he had been locked up to prevent the pig from attacking someone.
Yuan's family is said to have been in reparations talks for Yuan's death.
Although it is rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked her husband and his wife on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer into a tractor until his wife scared the animal and kidnapped it.
A farmer from Oregon was defeated by his own pigs in 2012. A Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be a "addictive".
Farmer: “The pigs are just joking.
They're curious scoundrels... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to respect them as much as you need.”
The remnants of the Rosa Hurricane bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
According to weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains that will cause selenium throughout the northwest of the United States along the north-west of Mexico.
As of 05:00, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with wind speeds of 85 miles per hour. According to Eastern Time, the hurricane was 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico on Sunday.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure strip forms along the Pacific Ocean and begins to move eastwards to the western edge of the United States. Rosa begins to approach the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday. The deep tropical humidity begins to reach the north, south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will leave rainfall in some areas of Mexico that will reach 10 inches in size.
Subsequently, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching low-pressure strip, will generate a large amount of heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Regionally, rainfall from 1 to 4 inches will likely lead to landslides in the desert, in addition to sudden flooding raids, and debris flows.
Deep tropical humidity will approximate rainfall rates in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, to 2 to 3 inches per hour.
In southwestern regions, especially much of Arizona, it is expected to rain enough to reach 2 to 4 inches in size.
Sudden waterfalls are possible in conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the dispersal nature of tropical rainfall.
In the wake of tropical rains, it is extremely troublesome to consider going to the desert as a spring.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into drizzleful rivers, boreholes can bring dust that is swept locally by strong winds.
The approaching low-pressure strip will leave some heavy rainfall locally on the southern California coastline.
It is possible to generate rainfall of more than half an inch in total, which can lead to slippage of roads with small-scale junk flows.
This will be the region's first rainfall in the rainy season.
Some of the tropical rains, scattered before the end of the rains on Tuesday to spread to wider areas, will begin to approach Arizona by the end of Sunday, early on Monday.
The heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue throughout Wednesday.
In October, a number of temperature fluctuations can be seen throughout the U.S. due to the fact that tropical strains remain quite hot as the polars cool.
Sometimes this situation can lead to sudden temperature changes over small distances.
There is a great example of sudden temperature changes that occurred throughout the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska. In addition, there is the same difference between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the late summer temperature will rise again and try to spread.
In many parts of the central and eastern U.S., along with October, the 80-degree inch generation is expected to feel a temperature that will begin from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City can see 80 traffic jams that are about 10 degrees higher than normal.
Our long-term climate forecast for the east of the U.S. gives a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by more than 20 million people
In an exhilarating statement on Thursday, the Supreme Court watched Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate, and allegedly, in the 1980s, the woman who accused him of sexual harassment, Christine Blasey Ford, more than 20 million people from six different television networks.
Meanwhile, his steer clear of politics continued with the regular schedule of Friday's turning of broadcasters at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to run an FBI investigation into the charges for a week.
Ford told the U.S. Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was 100 percent sure that he was trying to take off his clothes while he was drunk at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said he was not 100% sure what was said in his excited statement.
According to Nielsen's report, the trial on Friday was likely to be watched by more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the average number of viewers based on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
PBS did not immediately reach the number of other networks showing the trial, including C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the number of people who watch something in the office.
In other words, this number of spectators was of a similar size to an element match in American football or the audience of the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen's Fox News Channel, which was strongly supported by the idea's servers for Kavanaugh's appointment, during the day-long trial, all networks were left behind with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
After the trial, there was still high interest.
In Friday's drama, Flake was swimming in the center.
After the Republican office announced that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh captured CBS cameras protesting at CNN and CBS as they tried to go out with an elevator to the Justice Committee trial on Friday morning.
While being violently harassed, his standing in front of him for a few minutes was broadcast live on CNN.
A woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
Kavanaugh was told, "You have power when so many women are weak."
Flake said his office was in the statement before the elevator was closed, and there was more he would say at the committee's hearing.
All hours later, the wired networks and broadcasting networks were on live when the Justice Committee directed Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for the entire vote.
However, Flake said he would only investigate the FBI’s crimes directed at the island for as long as the minority Democrats demand for a week.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after speaking to the Coons and a few senators.
Flake's election had an effect because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the number of votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “making politics” over Brexit issue
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of “making political material” for Britain’s future, damaging national interests.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to May’s headline interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said May’s move against the so-called “women’s game” for Brexit was “totally ridiculous,” suggesting that Britain and the EU collect taxes from each other.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of a player playing at LSU (Louisiana State University)
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims, who played at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder.
Officials released video footage of Sims and Simpson's encounter. Police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the WAFB, the cop who picked up the glasses from the scene said that Simpson's DNA sample appeared on the glasses.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police said they confessed to having fatally shot him at Wayde.
The lawyer said the perpetrator's compensation was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Investigation Judge's Office released a preliminary statement on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot from the neck.
The department handed over the rights of the Louisiana State Police escape force, which helped with the latest investigation into the arrest, to the state police murder lab, with the University of the South, the local people.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional Armed Forces for their "fighting for justice" efforts.
Sims was 20 years old.
Wayne's father also grew up in Baton Rouge, a 6-foot-inch forefinger where he played basketball for LSU.
He played with an average of 2.6 rebounds with 5.6 points per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “broken” with Wayde’s death, and “in shock.”
Wade said, "That's what you're always worried about."
Volcano sprayed on Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after crater activity began. 183 gas and ash releases were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a lot of cheers and laughter.
Social media footage showed Mexico City covering the front windows of cars in thin layers of ash in neighboring places like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have also detected an increase in mobility in the volcano, located 45 miles south of the capital, since the earthquake that hit central Mexico in September 2017 with a magnitude of 7.1.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with separatist Catalans before the anniversary of the independence game
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday. The arrests took place after the clash of independence-backed protesters with agility. In addition, thousands of opposition demonstrations were held to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarizing game given for the departure of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists were held back by a flexible force. This group of policemen were lubricating eggs and throwing powder paints, creating dark-colored dust clouds on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
At the end of the day, when the police used their gun to start the fight, the fighting broke out.
For several hours, the independence-backed groups chanted songs against the "long live Spain" protesters in the form of "No Forget, No Forgiveness."
According to local media, fourteen people were treated as a result of minor injuries in the protests.
Tension remained high in the independence-backed region a year after the referendum on October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly preferred to remain independent, but the turnout remained low by boycotting those who voted against the split.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent people from going to polling stations throughout the region with violent clashes.
Independence groups set up a tent on Friday night to block national police support demonstrations for one night.
The show started, but had to follow a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcis Termes, who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful of the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
Narcis: “We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite the fact that they can deliver a vivid victory in December, many of their best leaders are either in forced exile or are awaiting trial for their roles in organising the declaration of independence following him in a referendum. The Catalan party is in the process of holding a trial.
The 42-year-old repairman, Joan Puig, who recorded the protest against police support by phone, said the debate was revived by politicians on both sides.
Joan Puig: “The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
Oriol said: “To be a candidate for elections in Europe is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values, the pressure we see from the Spanish government.”
Londonderry: Some men were arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested on a car crash at a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday, at Ballynagard Crescent, at approximately 7:30 p.m.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the doors and the building.
At some point, the car may have been shot with a spring rifle.
Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0 with Menga's bottle
Dolly Menga's first goal brought victory to Livingston
Livingston, who rose to the top of the league, shocked the Rangers by tasting Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
While the difference was creating Dolly Menga's shot, Gary Holt's team rose to second place along with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team has not yet won a relegation victory in the Premiership this season and will face the leader Hearts with eight points behind next Sunday.
Before this match, the Rangers will beat Rapid Wien in the European League game on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, scored six games in the league's invincibility series, and head coach Holt hasn't met with defeat since last month's take on the role from Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed positions in front of blinded guest team
Holt's team made all sorts of problems for the Rangers with an open game and could have moved forward long before the goal was scored.
Scott Robinson made the attack, but his effort was not enough to score. Then the ball of Alan Lithgow, who intervened by swiping to meet Craig Halkett's blow, went out in a different way.
The host team allowed the Rangers to play in the lead with the awareness that they would be experiencing difficult moments in the standings of the guest team.
This is how the important goal of the game came.
The Rangers gave the team a free kick, and in Livingston's organization Declan Gallagher and Robinson threw the ball at Menga, while Menga scored by touching the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had more of the ball but had difficulty going through the host's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problem,
This model of the game continued until the second half, despite Alfredo Morelos forcing Kelly to a rescue.
Scott Pittman threw the ball out on another Livingston standing ball while Rangers keeper Allan McGregor's feet blocked.
Two penalty claims, including intervention by Halkett's substitute player Glenn Middleton and playing one hand, were rejected by the referee while all of the middles were being removed from the Livingston penalty area.
"Extraordinary" match from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont, Tony Macaroni Arena
It's an extraordinary performance and result for Livingston.
Every player on the team was perfect and they continued to exceed expectations as a result of the exit.
The style and staff of the game haven't changed much since its return to the top of the league, but Holt, who has fired the team since his arrival, deserves the greatest of praise.
Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, he led a defense with a great organization, and I was disturbed by Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked a source of inspiration.
They're very much behind the good performance they show from time to time in Gerrard's management.
They failed in the last ball. They were only able to pass the opponent's defense once, and this could be a wake-up call for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the league.
Welcome to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne, good and bad
Turkish and German leaders met at a breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th) with smiling faces and a blue sky.
The meeting took place on the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany in order to restore relations between NATO allies.
The two countries have experienced differences of opinion on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s membership of the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne and opened a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police gave reasons for security to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters in the vicinity were ready to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, mostly Kurds, also voiced criticism of Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to impose them on the country.
The counter-protests show how a visitor who is considered a hero by some Turks living in Germany, and seen by some as a dictator, led to a split.
Deptford traffic accident: cyclist dies as a result of collision with car
A cyclist lost his life in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 a.m. British Summer Time on the outskirts of Bestwood Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and health officials intervened in the incident, but the person lost his life on the scene.
The accident took place on Saturday, a few months after another cyclist died in a crash and escape on Childers Street, about a mile from the mall.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family of his identity.
The road was closed, bus routes were changed and drivers were advised to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six prison officials were injured in the confusion that emerged in a high-security male prison.
The confusion on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. British Summer Time came out and continues at Long Lartin, the Her Majesty's Prison (HMP) in Worcestershire.
Expert "Tornado" officials were brought in to deal with the confusion of eight inmates and a stopped wing.
Officers with small facial wounds were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been hired to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six staff members were treated.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be sent to the police and stay longer behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 convicts, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison manager was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, insurgents were called to the prison to solve a serious confusion in which officials were attacked with billiard balls.
Risk of Cell Pressure in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City due to Pink Hurricane (It May Be Beneficial for Dry Areas)
It’s rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical depression, but that’s exactly what caused the energy from the Rosa Hurricane to pass through the Southwest Desert early this week.
The National Weather Forecast Agency issued flood warnings for the area covering Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the rain at the end of the day.
The National Weather Forecasting Agency in Phoenix tweeted: “Since 1950, there have only been ten tropical storms, tropical storms, or depressions around Phoenix 200 miles away!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict that there will be 2 to 4 inches of rainfall along with amounts of up to 6 inches at the Arizona Mogollon Range.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the Middle Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, can receive 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, while in wet areas this volume can reach 4 inches.
With drought prevailing in the region, the rains brought by Rosa in areas where there is no risk of flooding can be a blessing.
While saliva is a serious problem, some of these precipitations may be useful because the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
“According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the problem of extreme drought, which is at least the second highest category.”
First, the route of Rosa Hurricane is advancing through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico to make contact with the land for the first time.
With a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Rosa, Punta Eugenia, is located 385 miles south of Mexico and is advancing at a speed of 12 miles per hour north.
The storm is slowing down as it encounters colder waters in the Pacific.
Therefore, Monday afternoon or evening tropical storm force is expected to reach the territory of Mexico.
Severe rains that can be seen in some parts of Mexico can pose a significant flood risk.
According to Weather.com, “Baja California and Northwestern Sonora are expected to have a total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, which is also possible to reach 10 inches.”
Rosa will then reach the Arizona border as a tropical storm following northern Mexico in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then enter Arizona and late Tuesday night into southern Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said, “The main danger expected from the Rose or its remains is that Baja California is causing very intense rainfall in northwestern Sonora and the US’s Southeast Desert.”
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flooding, mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three young children and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found injured with a knife in Somerset.
Young boy Midsomer Norton was found wounded at around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was "stable."
According to Avon and Somerset Police, within a short period of time, one was arrested in the Redstock area at the age of 17, two at the age of 18 and the other at the age of 20.
Authorities have appealed to anyone who might have an image of the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh’s Democratic Party is a “victim of cowardice and anger”
Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, “A vote to be given to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and immeasurable tactics.”
Trump said Kavanaugh was the "victim of the Democratic Party's cowardice and anger" throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh strongly and enthusiastically rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that she was sexually harassed when she was both young years ago before Congress on Thursday.
Ford also made a statement in connection with his claim.
On Saturday, the president told mass supporters in West Virginia: “The American people saw the light, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
A vote to approve Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to approve one of the most successful legal intelligences of our time, a lawyer with valuable achievements in public service."
While talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy.
“One of the most important choices of our lives is five weeks.
I don’t run, but I really run.”
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
According to a statement made to CNN by one of the senior Republican Party assistants, the Senate is expected to hold the first major vote on the method for Kavanaugh's candidacy by Friday.
Hundreds of people died in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, balance sheet rising
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people died as a result of the major earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and that a large number of people were stranded in huge waves.
When waves of up to six metres (18 ft) high hit the coast on Friday in the city of Palu, hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival, and the waves destroyed everything in front of them as many people were dragging to death.
There was a tsunami after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency BNPB, said at an information gathering in Jakarta, “When yesterday’s tsunami threatened, people were continuing their activities on the beach, they did not immediately escape and they were victims of the incident.”
"It wasn't just a tsunami; it dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was advancing at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before reaching the coastline.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed that a large number of buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges were bent and collapsed, and the surrounding area of a mosque was covered with water.
On Saturday, further upheavals continued in the coastal city.
In the region of 2.4 million people, earthquakes were felt in the aftermath.
Indonesia’s Technology Evaluation and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said the energy generated by the big tremor on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb left at Hiroshima in World War II.
It was said that the geography of the city, located at the end of a narrow and long bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "large in diameter" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He added that the bodies belonging to some of the victims were trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho, 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, said the number of injured and the size of the damage could be greater along the coastal area of Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's central base.
Nugroho said the communication in Donggala was "completely paralyzed and no information was received."
The Red Cross said in a statement that “more than 300,000 people live there,” adding that staff and volunteers were reaching the affected areas.
"Even in this state, it's a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," he said.
Despite officials saying that the waves had come within the warning period, the agency received widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu.
Amateur camera footage shared on social media can be heard screaming a man on the top floor of a building madly to warn people on the street below about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a water wall hits the beach, folds in front of buildings and vehicles.
Reuters did not immediately verify the camera image.
The earthquake and tsunami have made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts as a cause of a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu.
According to officials, the army began sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations are still in dire need of food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport was reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the tsunami account exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseba, his team from World Vision in Donggala safely reached the city of Palu on the road through the scenes of destruction and the workers stayed in the mud tents set up in their office garden.
Doseba said, "They told me they saw a lot of broken houses."
It's really bad.
Even if aid groups make a relentless effort to start disaster relief efforts, there are some complaints that foreign aid organization employees with extensive expertise are prevented from going to Palu.
According to regulations in Indonesia, money, aid, and humanitarian aid can only begin to flow from abroad if a disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
This announcement has not yet been made.
Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said, “This is still a disaster at the regional level.”
“After the government has said, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we may be open to international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night in Palu, after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the families and relatives of the missing are still hopeful that miracles may have disrupted the unsavory stories of the natural disasters they love.
On Saturday, a little boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams took out a woman who had been trapped under a pile of stones caused by the cell for two days, along with her mother's body.
Indonesian parachute national team coach Gendon Subandono was running two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
According to Mr. Mandagi, the ones left behind were his students at the Roa Roa Hotel.
"I'm pulling my own emotional burden as a retiree in the field of parachute hunting," he said.
Gendon recounted how the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's demolition circulated among the climbing parachute community, desperatingly sending WhatsApp messages to Palu contestants attending the beach festival.
However, the messages remained as a grey sign of approval instead of a double blue sign.
"I think that means that messages can't be sent," he said.
Thieves Receive $26,750 During ATM Filling at Newport on the Levee
The Newport Police Department reported that on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee filling the Newport on the Levee ATM.
In the news, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver had emptied the ATM at the amusement facility and prepared to charge more money.
While on duty, another man stole a bag full of money to be loaded into the ATM "running behind the Brink employee."
Witnesses said there were more than one suspect who escaped from the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Those who know the identity of these individuals must contact the Newport Police on the phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the words: “The man officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, had been using Ye juice for a while, and gave that name to her eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made prior to the release of Saturday Night Live, which was expected to introduce the new album Yandhi.
The show's producer said it would replace Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons."
West said that, in addition to being an abbreviation of the existing professional name, the word was also religiously important to him.
When West spoke to Big Boy, the radio host, earlier this year, about the name of the album, he said, "I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible and 'you' in the Bible."
"So I'm you, I'm us, we're the thing.
From Kanye's only meaning, our good, our evil, our confusion turned into Ye, which is a reflection of everything we do.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's just one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs had various nicknames such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Formerly working with West, JAY-Z also uses the name in bold or impertinent and in upper-case or lower-case letters.
Mexican AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country's bloody repression against students nears its 50th anniversary.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador said in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military force to keep the Mexican people under pressure.
On October 2, 1968, military units opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in South America, killing 300 people during a time when left-wing student movements took root.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free state universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities has attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence funding.
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who has previously worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said China should double the amount the U.S. spends on research in this area because it is increasing its effectiveness in artificial intelligence.
After announcements were made by various public institutions in the U.S., there were comments that the U.S. did not even have an official artificial intelligence strategy in general.
China, on the other hand, announced last year’s plan: It aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
Lee said, “When we consider that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and are looking for the next big innovation in artificial intelligence, it would be a good start to double the budget for artificial intelligence research.”
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said the two-fold fund doubles the likelihood of next major AI success in the U.S.
"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order), published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Lee is one of the most important artificial intelligence companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-placed American Othello (Reversi) player at Carnegie Mellon University, and later served as president of Microsoft Research and Google's China branch.
Lee recalled technology competitions previously held by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would be held to help determine the next visionaries.
Lee said that it is often necessary to work hard in the U.S. to get state support.
Lee said, “Academic leaders are covering companies, not China.”
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring students from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. work on artificial intelligence.
“I think people who have a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically given a green card,” he said.
The China Consultation published the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Science Foundation of China (NWF) is providing funding to academics in the U.S. as it has been distributed to researchers by the National Science Foundation and other public institutions, but that the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence aimed at the participation of partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of an Elected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
On the other hand, there has been no action for months on U.S. legislation that called for the creation of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonian people voted to change the name of the "Republic of North Macedonia" as a move to resolve the dispute with Greece, which has been obstructing EU and NATO membership applications for years.
Greece, a region called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbor means a demand for rights over Greek territory, and vetoes membership of the EU with NATO.
The two governments had reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the new change would harm the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavs, who make up the majority of the population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the 50% turnout required for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the ballot box of the referendum is: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, this fee is worth paying for the cost of being admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
The 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, in Skopje, said: “I came here today so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which means safer lives for all of us.”
Despite the lack of legal binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would comply with the result of the vote to clarify the decision.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, participation in the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66% of registered voters voted, remained only 16%, compared to 34%.
Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital, said: “I came to vote for my children, our place is Europe.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko used their votes in a referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, to change the country’s name.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and lifting the chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said, “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to get into our heads upright, not through the service door.”
“We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other options such as China and Russia and join the integration of Eurasia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority of our citizens will vote positively because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," he said.
He said the "yes" result would be "to secure our future."
Last Monday, a poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research suggested that 30 to 43 percent of voters (under the previous participation) would take part in the referendum.
In another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV channel, 57% of participants said they planned to vote on Sunday.
He said 70 percent of them would say yes.
In order for my referendum to be successful, it must reach a 50% plus a vote.
A failure in my referendum will be the first serious political blow that the Western-backed government has taken since coming to office in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero has reached the goal by passing all of Brighton’s defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling distributed Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero was able to easily show the goal he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper took a pass in the midfield at the start of the series.
After running between three Brighton defenders, he reached the open field.
Then Aguero's surroundings were wrapped in four green shapes.
First he went over one defender, then Brighton left a few more on the edge of the penalty area.
Then he found Sterling by sending a pass to the left.
The English forward gave the ball back to Aguero by making his first touch on the penalty area, and Aguero hit the right side of the castle and chased Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters, “He’s struggling with some of the problems on Aguero’s feet.”
"We talked to him about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky to have the goal at that moment."
But Sky Mavilere was Sterling who won the first advantage in the Premier League fight.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero met the ball on the Brighton field in that game.
He threw a nice ball at Leroy Sane from the left wing.
Sane made a few touches before he redirected Sterling to the remote bar.
The Sky Blues sent the ball to the nets before sliding off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer plans to break the game against the Rockies
There's not much reason left to force a fresh start with the Nationals saying goodbye to the drafts.
But if Scherzer, which is always a competitive structure, still has a play-off chance for the Rockies, who have more wins than the Los Angeles Dodgers in West NL, he hopes to clear the pitch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday.
The Rockies won at least 5–2 against the Nationals, but are still trying to win their first league championship.
“Even if we don’t have any goals here, we can do our best with the crowded atmosphere in Denver, with the awareness that the rival team will be playing at the highest level I will be able to face this year.
Why don’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a launcher for Sunday, but in such a case it is reported that they will allow Scherzer to make the shot.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, did a warming-up workout on Thursday and will take the shot in its normal place on Sunday.
Washington's right-hand fifty players have an average of 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts during this season's 220 2/3 stroke.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
While the President spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the Supreme Court implicitly referred to the situation in which Kavanaugh lived.
"Everything we do in November is in danger.
One of the most important choices of our lives is five weeks.
Very, very big. I’m not running, but I’m actually running, so I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump continued, “You see this terrible radical Democratic group, you see what’s happening right now.
You are determined to take back power in every way you need, you see their cruelty, their disgust.
They don't care who they're hurting to take power and control, who they're going to squeeze over, and that's why they want power and control, but we won't give it to them."
He said the Democrats had adopted the mission of "resistance and deterrence."
“You’ve seen this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and ruthless, disgusting and lying.”
When he named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking judge of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the crowd was on the rise.
"Do you remember what you answered?
Did you leak the document?
Ah, ah, no.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. Body language was very bad, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Business Party is no longer a free-thinking platform.
People who say their ideas are not tolerated.
I wasn’t surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted for me to apply censorship.
After all, I'm the last person to be told that we're not well received for saying our ideas among Labour MPs.
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan has also received a similar treatment because she has shown a firm stance against the Jewish anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship proposal criticised me for getting into a disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, issues such as national security, the importance of Europe, issues similar to those that Jeremy had had with previous leaders.
In the announcement of Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting, there was a statement that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In most of the eight years I spent as a local parliamentarian of the Labour Party, GC meetings on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately today, not like the style of many meetings, and even if there were before, the promise of "more polite" politics has long been forgotten.
It became increasingly clear that different views were not tolerated in the Workers’ Party and that every idea was judged by the party’s administration.
This came about shortly after Jeremy was the leader. My colleagues, who I thought I had a similar political opinion before, asked me to make a U-turn on issues such as national security or the EU common market, and to show a position I would never accept.
Every time I speak to the public (it doesn’t really matter what I say), I come across a gang of insults calling for degradation on social media, denouncing the centre’s policies and saying I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one living this.
I know I’m luckier than some of my friends because the comments directed to me are usually political.
Every day I face the scourge of sexist or racist insults and I feel the respect and admiration for the professionalism and determination of these friends who never withdraw themselves.
One of the saddest aspects of this political period is how the levels of insult are normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn suggested last week that the Labour Party should feed a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer that free-thinking platform, and the party is shrinking with every “insecurity” proposal or the change of election rules.
In the last two years, I've gotten a lot of advice about not getting involved in dairy, not getting my voice out too much, and then "everything's going to be okay."
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student who was in action with the failure of the Thatcher government's extensive school class 32 years ago, I've worked to provide better public services to those most in need as a local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my policies, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever been confused about my political stance and the areas in which I disagree with the current administration.
I will say to all those who support Friday’s proposal, as I move hard to a Brexit that will hurt the country’s domestic economies, businesses and our public services, I can’t understand so much about my commitment to the Labour Party administration.
But the message I really want to give is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters who are members of the Labour Party and who are not: I am proud to serve you and I can’t stop doing what I believe will serve your best interests without any threat of collapse or political exclusion.
Chris Leslie, Nottingham East Members of Parliament
Month 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Month Set in the First Order
The final two tries in the last few minutes may have changed a bit, but Ayr was definitely the one who deserved the win in this very fun Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are currently at the top of the league and the only team in the top ten to have no defeat.
In the end, thanks to their fantastic defenses as much as they use their upcoming chances, the host team and coach Peter Murchie is very right to be satisfied.
“We’ve tested our games so far and we’re still not defeated, so I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Congratulations to Ayr, they’ve used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazier Climo put Ayr ahead, but the game of the Warriors with the yellow card seen by Scottish captain Rory Hughes was released, so Melrose spoke up the numbers and Jason Baggot, an unconverted attempt.
Climo took Ayr 17-5 ahead of the break, turning the number into a solo attempt, after passing Ayr with a penalty.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot reduced the difference to five.
Then there was a long pause during Ruairidh Knott's serious disability and take-off with the saddle, and when the match resumed Ayr made a difference to a Stafford McDowall attempt turned by Climo.
Ayr's captain in the game, Blair Macpherson, saw the yellow card and Melrose again used the advantage of too many men with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt at the end of a harsh crackdown.
However, the host team came back as a result of Struan Hutchinson's interference with Climo in the open field, seeing a yellow card and scoring victory with MacPherson's touch from the penalty line.
Kyle Rowe picked up the ball after David Armstrong's box kick kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry for the host team's fifth try. Then Climo once again made the conversion shot from the almost restart line.
Still Game star seems to be stepping into a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran is preparing to enter the food industry. The player turns out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and played with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of the series. Apparently, Kiernan began planning how to continue his life after Craiglang ended.
According to official records, the actor appears to be the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the subject, but a source reached by the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan planned to be thrown into Glasgow's "growing restaurant industry."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no coastline, hopes the court will reopen a path to reach the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the armed naval headquarters in La Paz.
A blue flag is waving in public buildings.
All sea bases, from Lake Titikaka to the Amazon, are covered with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to take this right to heal.”
The memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century struggle continues to live in the memory of the people of Bolivia who are not on the coast of the sea. The desire to open up to the Pacific Ocean once again has not yet been extinguished.
Today, Bolivia's hopes have increased perhaps as never before in recent years. The country awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice (IJJ), which will be held on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said, “Bolivia is looking forward to the outcome in a spirit of energy, unity and coexistence and, of course, with a positive outlook.”
Many Bolivians across the country will monitor the decision of the UAD from large screens. Bolivia, after decades of irregular negotiations, has been forced to negotiate the provision of an independent piece of land from Chile to Bolivia for maritime transport. Bolivian states that Bolivarians are obliged to negotiate a land grant.
Bolivia's local charismatic leader, Evo Morales, also relied on Monday's decision to be made. Morales faces a fierce struggle for next year's re-election.
Morales pledged at the end of August "too close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
But some analysts say that the court is less likely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that there will be no serious change even if it decides in favor.
The Netherlands-based UN agency does not have the authority to hand over land belonging to Chile to Bolivia, and the outcome of the possible talks will not be determined by the agency.
According to Chilean international law expert Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, the UAD has made a decision only six months after the latest defenses were made that the case was "not complicated".
Moreover, the talks held over the last four years may have been much more opposed to supporting Bolivia’s arguments.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said, “The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration.”
According to Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Morales's aggressive remarks also consumed the Chileans' last goodwill feelings on the subject.
Bolivia and Chile will be back on the table at some point, but after that it will be quite difficult to hold talks.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, denied allegations that the court's decision was taken at an unusual speed.
In a statement, Veltzé said Monday would give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of disputes, benefiting both sides".
Calzadilla also denied the claim that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue for political interests.
According to Morales, "Bolivia will never give up on access to the Pacific Ocean."
"This decision is an opportunity to show that we need to resolve issues in the past."
North Korea will not abandon nuclear weapons until it trusts the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said he would never give up on nuclear weapons unless he trusted Washington.
Ri made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The minister called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit between the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
Ri’s remarks came three months after talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, implying that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy talks, which will soon come to an end.
Ri described the idea that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S.’s objection to the announcement of an end to the Korean War would crush North Korea as merely an “empty dream.”
Pyongyang is cautiously approaching the signing of the Washington notification until major disarmament steps are taken.
Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang is serious about giving up nuclear weapons that it sees as the only means to ensure security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The latest huge hat collections you’ll see in store displays soon come to the forefront of Paris Fashion Week
If you want to add larger hats to your collection or completely block the sun, it is now very easy to find the right hats for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased the incredible variety of accessories for the 2019 Spring/Summer collection on the podium. This collection also fascinated the names that set their style trends at Paris Fashion Week.
Unusual hats this summer had scratched Instagram, and the designers of these hats put their eye-catching designs on the podium.
One of Valentino’s prominent designs was an exaggerated beige hat with feather-like details that surrounded the entire head of the model.
Other large-sized accessories include carp ornamented with precious stones, a wizard hat, or even a pineapple, but of course these accessories are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne presented another collection of bizarre masks, which also very much embraced the spirit of the upcoming Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were mouth-closed, and the masks resembled Hannibal Lecter much more than haute couture designs.
One of the designs resembled a full-tube diving gear with snorkeling and sea glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cube.
If you’re following huge fashion trends, you’re lucky.
Style experts say that in a short time these huge hats can fit in the showcases of stores.
The big hats, along with the collection called "La Bomba", quickly became trendy. We've seen very wide-brimmed hats, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
This brand behind the useless hat fashion spread on social media presented a larger design in its display: the hashish beach bag it was carrying showed the size of a canopy model almost as big as it was on the podium.
The prominent design of the La Riviera Spring/Summer collection, which Jacquemus brought out to the public at Paris Fashion Week 2019, was a dark orange shelf bag decorated with shelves and finished with a white leather bag handle.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL about these designs: "I expect big hats and beach bags to take their place in next summer's store showcases. The designer has created such a huge impact that it's very difficult to resist the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are of great importance to the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a successful academic past. In 2018, this success was sustained by extraordinary test results, supported by the work of sport, art, music and other civil society.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools work to provide the best level of service to students and guardians.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for the career they choose, and to become a world citizen.
As educational institutions that can prepare and implement a special curriculum for students, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and necessary lesson in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to your mind from a language he understands,
If you speak your mother tongue, you will speak to your heart.”
If we want to build relationships and mutual trust with people from other countries, this is a strong reminder that we should not rely solely on English.
Based on the final exam results of this year, we can see that language classes in independent schools are at the top of the scoreboards with the highest passing grades.
This year, 68% of students taking foreign language courses passed their classes with a high grade of A.
According to data collected from SCIS’s 74 member schools, 72 percent of students taking Chinese lessons, 72 percent of those taking German courses, 69 percent of those taking French courses, and 63 percent of those taking Spanish courses passed A.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language lessons as basic skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Language courses, which are elective courses, are now equivalent to FeTeMM (Fen Sciences, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) courses in independent schools and other schools.
In 2014, a study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of employers were associated with a lack of language skills due to the fact that they were experiencing difficulties while recruiting new members for vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming even more necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
Because more employers are required to know the language for potential job opportunities, these skills have become basic skills in a globalizing world.
If a person knows a second language independently of the career he chooses, he will have a real advantage in the future because he has this skill that he can use for life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from outside the country leads the person who knows more than one language to the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, more than 4,000 people living in the UK do not know enough foreign languages to be able to chat with 75%, and (15%) do not reach a two-digit rate in any foreign language except French.
Therefore, investing in language learning from today onwards is of great importance to the children of the future.
Being able to speak multiple languages, including the languages of emerging economies, will increase children’s chances of finding a suitable and reasonable job in the future.
Languages taught in schools in Scotland are very different.
While certain schools offer more traditional modern language options, some schools also teach languages that are thought to be important for the UK in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter which field your child is interested in, they may prefer one of the various foreign language options taught by specialized teachers in this field in independent schools.
Scottish independent schools aim to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children for the future and equip them with the skills necessary for success.
In today’s global business environment, water continues to carry vital importance for the future of the country by foreign languages. This must also be reflected in the real life of education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity, and success to the youth of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools.
LeBron will wear Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday
For fans waiting for LeBron James to go to the Los Angeles Lakers’ first game, the wait will be over very soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced on Sunday that James would be on the pitch in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
Walton said on Lakers' official website that "this time will be less than a minute, less than 48 minutes."
According to Lakers reporter Mike Trudell’s tweet, James will likely remain on the pitch for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
James said: “I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for this stage of my career.
Trump's Hour of the West Virginia Meeting, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting an intensive meeting program tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This meeting will be the first of five meetings Trump will hold next week. The program also includes breaks to welcome Trump in a friendly manner, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump's approval vote for the vacant U.S. Supreme Court candidate has been suspended. Trump is aiming to gain public support for the Republican Party, which faces the risk of losing its supremacy in the November elections.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia meeting to be held tonight, and how can you watch the meeting from the internet?
Trump’s Wheeling, West Virginia meeting is scheduled to be held tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. Eastern (US and Canada) time.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia meeting live from the YouTube channel below.
Trump will most likely refer to this week's session on Brett Kavanaugh, whom he has nominated for membership of the Supreme Court. The sexual assault allegations and the expected approval vote in the Senate have been suspended for up to a week from the FBI's investigation.
However, the main purpose of this intensive meeting program is to help the Republican Party, which faces the risk of defeat in the November elections, gain momentum.
According to Reuters news, President Trump’s campaign spokespersons next week’s five meetings aim to “promote volunteers and supporters to preserve and expand the supremacy the Republican Party has in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.”
A spokesperson working for the Trump campaign, who did not want to give his name, told Reuters: “Congress control is so important to the president’s agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible during the intense campaign period.”
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the meeting, which is scheduled to be held tonight at the Wheeling Wesbanco Arena, "may attract supporters in the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania and may be featured in the Pittsburgh media."
Trump will have visited the state twice in the past month at a rally on Saturday. The U.S. president won the 2016 election in the state of West Virginia by more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate who is behind the Republican Party polls.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters: “The president has to come and support Morrisey in the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team maintains the fight to keep hope alive as it approaches single matches to be held on Sunday
After three one-sided matches, the four-sided matches, which took place on Saturday afternoon, added vigor to the Ryder Cup.
It is a completely inventive sport concept that the momentum constantly passes from one team to another during the competition, but athletes strongly believe in this concept. Especially in games like this.
And the players think who my moment is right now?
Jordan Spieth said: “They started six points ahead, and that difference has dropped to four right now, so I can say we’re gaining some momentum.”
Of course, the European team, who are four points ahead and can earn twelve more points in the match, ended up with an advantage.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they are taking the wind behind them, and many factors such as the fact that Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together all day long, are in shape and both get three points out of four holes, encourage Americans.
Spieth was an example to everyone by showing excellent performance from the starting point to the end point.
Victory screams from the neck during Spieth's round were getting stronger. Spieth and Thomas made a significant putting blow to bring the score together after losing both holes.
The 15th putting blow to the American team that won the match also brought a similar shout of joy, which showed that Spieth believed the American team was continuing the fight.
Spieth used the phrase, “You have to force yourself and only think about your own performance.”
At the moment, all players have to think about it.
There are 18 holes left that can make a difference.
The only pair to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed top two of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's different but cute duo won points in four of the four holes and made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only duo that didn't make a bogey strike on Saturday afternoon. They also avoided bogey strikes on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning at the last nine back nine.
These performances and their energies pass into the crowd with enthusiasm and the power they get from the crowd in return supports the idea that they will gain on Sunday. Probably the most popular players will be Fleetwood or Molinari to determine a potential European victory as the day ends at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both are expected to bring this victory in different holes at the same time.
But it’s too early to talk about the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball matches, and Alex Noren, in a short match.
A bogey and two double bogey hits in the first nine holes led to a bad score that the Spanish and Swedish players could not survive until the end of the match.
But on Sunday, no one can help change the bad score.
Being able to watch fourball and their foursome matches closely is a truly fascinating experience. Seeing the interaction between couples offers a very interesting experience to see that the advice they give each other or hide from each other and that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe has so far performed better as a team and entered the final day with a serious difference. However, these four matches showed that the U.S. team has not lost the fighting audacity, especially, and eliminated doubts on the U.S. side.
Europe's Ryder Cup takes the lead 10-6 in the final day
The European team, which completed their four-ball and four-some matches on Saturday against the U.S. team 10-6 ahead, enters the final day of the Ryder Cup with a big advantage.
Exciting twins Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made headlines by winning two wins against Tiger Woods to score four points at Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, aiming to take the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, won the American team, which did not hit the goal in the morning's fourball game, and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. won two matches by showing more resistance in the match, but the difference did not dissipate.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to hold the cup.
After a sensational weekend, Fleetwood became the first European ice hockey player to score 4 points, while Molinari took the name "Molliwood" and he was the second pair to win four points in the Ryder Cup opening history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the team's games, Woods and American cricketer Bryson Dechambeau were perfectly prepared to beat out much more effective with a 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball and four-match tournaments and has seven series of defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning's four-ball game, teamed up with Dustin Johnson and his partner, Brooks Koepka, respectively, with Henrik Stenson, and a 2&1 loss.
Still, Europe couldn’t do things the way it wanted on a nice and airy day in the south of Paris.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the continent for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
After Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter won a challenging 2&1 in the fours, Poulter and Rory McIlroy lost the first two holes in the fours and lost 4&3.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only two teams remain with the singles four points behind, but as holders of the cup, it is enough for the Furyk team to win together to hold the cup.
However, after being the second best for two days, it looks like Sunday will be far beyond the counter-attack forces.
North Korea Says Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence Is “No Way” Possible
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the ongoing embargoes on the United Nations deepened the insecurity of the United States and that the country could not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" such as promising to halt last year's nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area, and not producing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Despite this, we don't see any compensation from the United States," he added.
“He will not be able to build faith in our own national security without any confidence in the United States, and under these conditions, there will be no way of disarming ourselves unilaterally first.”
Ri reiterated his well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage" approach that North Korea will be rewarded for stepping up, while unilaterally rejecting the removal of nuclear weapons, as Pyongyang has seen in the past.
Ri, who was held in Singapore on June 12 between the US president and a North Korean leader for the first time, while working on Kim's "nuclear clearance of the Korean peninsula" as he pledged to open the door to Trump's announcement on North Korea's security.
North Korea is looking for ways to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington was also resisting calls for a loosening of the tough international sanctions in North Korea.
Ri said, “The U.S. is insisting first of all on nuclear deterrence and is increasing the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goals in a compelling manner. It is even opposed to ‘the announcement of the end of the war,’” he said.
“The perception that things can bring us down on our knees is an empty dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions reinforce our insecurity.”
Ri made no announcement earlier this week about a second summit plan to be held between the U.S. leader Trump and Kim.
Instead, he underlined the three talks between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: "If it were not the United States, it was South Korea, it would be the nuclear depletion of the Korean peninsula."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech at last year’s UN General Assembly was unavoidable, according to last year’s speech, which Mr. Demon President Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission, saying North Korea’s missiles were unavoidable to target the mainland of the United States.
Last year, Trump, who threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for showing the courage to take steps to disarm Kim at the United Nations this year, but there is still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions must continue until North Korea is cleared of nuclear deterrence.
On Wednesday, Trump said, “It doesn’t matter if these two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
As a result of the steps taken by China and Russia, the UN Security Council has argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue with violence and without any failure until complete, definite and verified nuclear deterrence is carried out.”
The Security Council has voted unanimously to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to halt Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri during the UN General Assembly, after which he said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, North Korea condemned him by saying that it had made “Mafia demands” for him.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that the United States would take "mutual measures" to dismantle a missile field and a nuclear complex.
Moon said Kim’s “reciprocal measures” he was looking for were Trump’s security guarantees in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are getting enough resting classes.
A new course at Harvard University this year guides all of its students to more sleep in order to struggle with the growing ma<0xC3><0xA7>o culture of 'all nocturnes' who work through caffeine.
When it comes to caring for themselves, an academic found that the students of the world’s number one university were unaware of even the most basic information.
The course, which she believes to be the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Harvard Medical School professor of sleep therapy and Brigham and Women’s Hospital specialist Charles Czeisler.
The lesson was inspired by a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
“At the end of the conversation, a female student came to me and said, ‘Why are all these things being told to me now, when I’m in my last session?’
“He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me so much.”
The course, which opened for the first time this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and also how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and the university’s general director of health services, said the university’s decision was made after students realized that they were seriously sleepless within a week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of how the students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books are impacted by the effects of coffee and light on athletic performance due to lack of sleep, as well as a homeroom where they listen to them talk about the importance of regular sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map containing interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their own daily routines.
“We know that students will not change their behavior immediately.
However, we believe that if you have the right to learn how to prefer smoking, you have the right to learn in the same way that you have the right to learn,” added Prof. Cheisler.
He added that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students, i.e. sleep deprivation, is a growing problem, and there is still a culture of pride in "working all night."
To get enough sleep and ensure that sleep is of good quality, students should have a "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. Even to avoid gaining too much weight, because lack of sleep is putting the brain into hunger mode. How do students constantly open themselves to feeling when they are starving?
A 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, Raymond So, who took a class of Professor Cheisler in his first year at the school last year, helped Professor Cheisler design the course.
He said the class opened his eyes and inspired him to raise awareness on campus.
In the next step, the undergraduate hopes to ask students to complete a similar course before joining competitive institutions.
Professor Cheisler advises students to set up alarms at the time they wake up as well as at the time they will. He also warns them about the harmful effects of "blue light", which disrupts the daily rhythm of electronic displays and LED lights, causing problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga, Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's stroke brings Steven Gerrard's scattered team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston, while the Rangers are experiencing yet another displacement regret.
The Ibrox team had been trying to take their first win in the move since the 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February. However, Gary Holt's team exposed Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager to the team's Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
He scored me seven minutes at the end of the first tomorrow and the low-moral Rangers eleven never seemed to come to their senses.
Now, as the Rangers fell to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place behind Hibernian with only one goal difference.
Also, the foreign matter that was clearly thrown away seems to be on the way to more trouble for the Rangers after it hit side referee Calum Spence and after the open wound at the head of the referee has been treated.
Gerrard took Ayr out of the Betfred Cup semi-finals by replacing eight players in his team.
Holt, on the other hand, hadn't made any changes to Livingston 11, scoring a point from the Hearts last week, and he could have been happy that his strong team didn't breathe in his opponent at every opportunity.
Although the Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston did more work with the ball they had.
Menga's first short pass, Scott Pittman, was supposed to have found a goal in the second minute that Allan McGregor sent him to the castle, but the midfielder missed out on this great opportunity.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs then found free kick captain Craig Halkett but teammate defender Alan Lithgow shot the ball straight out of the back.
Although the Rangers took control, it seemed like there was more hope than faith in their games in the last thirty minutes.
When he collided with Steven Lawless in the last fifteen minutes of the game, Alfredo Morelos believed they were definitely getting a penalty, but Judge Steven Thomson did not listen to Colombia's objections.
The Rangers managed to send only two of their shots to the castle in the first half, but the former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly Lassana did not struggle with Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's calm shot.
Although Livingston missed the first 34 minutes of the game, no one can deny that they have won the match with their efforts.
Again, the Rangers didn't care about Jacobs' long-standing ball.
Declan Gallagher did not make any moves when sending the ball to Scott Robinson, who would send Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly by removing Ryan Kent between the circuits. The change immediately showed the effect when the wing player sent the ball to Morelos, but the effective goalkeeper blocked the ball by jumping from Kelly's castle.
However, Livingston continued to draw its guests into the game, which they enjoyed playing with long balls that Lithgow and Halkett sent after.
Holt's team could have raised the difference in the final stages of the game, but McGregor stood up to block Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide headshot from the corner.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton, after colliding with Jacobs towards the end of the match, asked for a penalty for the team again, but referee Thomson again ignored the request.
Germany: The Invention of the Geiger Count
Now, "Sunday Morning" is a page from our German: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago from today, and the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger eventually developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would bring along the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Count, one of the indispensable sciences, has been one of the indispensables of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who seem unlikely to make the 1950s.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger Counter used to find radioactive substances like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms distributed by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Cidden, they definitely explode now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to "See" Malignant Cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and kill malicious cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malicious cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from patients and comparing them in the laboratory.
These cells "see" the protein that is common in many cancer cells and are re-injected
The test vaccine presents promising results in patients who have cancer at varying levels.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize malignant cells had seen uterine cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking the immune cell from patients and injecting the cells with the HER2 protein, which is found in many cancer cells, and injecting it again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “causes the growth of many types of cancers, including breast, uterine, lung and colon cancers,” said Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined the Trump Supporter Debate after he left SNL wearing a MAGA Hat.
It didn't go well for him.
Kanye West was cast in the studio during Saturday Night Live after inconsistent speeches he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would sit in the presidency in 2020.
After the third song of the night, and his song called Ghost Town, which he was wearing the Make America Great hat, he gave up on the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I spoke to a white man many times and they said to me, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I had concerns about racism, I would have left America a long time ago.”
The SNL show began with a sketch where Matt Damon starred and Hollywood star Christine Blasey Ford joked about the allegations of sexual harassment against the Senate Judiciary Committee by Brett Kavanaugh.
Though not published, images of West's speeches were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of the hat he wore on his head.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that hat."
They harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the western world?" and he said, "I'm going to wear my super coats, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try the love."
According to Variety, West's comments were leaked by the audience at least twice and SNL cast players seemed embarrassed, one person from around said to the press: "The whole studio was buried in dead silence."
West was called at the last minute instead of singer Ariana Grande, who died a few days ago when her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died.
West had surprised many with the song I Love It, which he sang in a Perrier Bottle.
West supported TPUSA president Candace Turner, a conservative group, with the tweet: "Thank you to one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURSE TO CALABALITY."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is nobody but him and that's absolutely great."
“But I’m choosing not to reward someone who I think adopts and distributes the ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying music or clothing or by supporting art).
He's a free man.
And so are we, too.”
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "officially known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name and go after Diddy, also known as Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg changed his name to Snoop Lion. Of course, the dying music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and became an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticised for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for the character of fighter Jon Snow in the fantasy medieval series Game of Thrones, which features scenes of violence from HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor has been harshly criticized for the ma<0xC3><0xA7>o heroic cliché. The celebrity actor noted that the prominence of such roles on the screen often causes young men to feel compelled to be harsh in order to see respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture appendix, Kit said she thought “some things weren’t right” and questioned how to combat the toxic masculinity problem during the <0x23>MeToo period.
Kit, who was recently married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, her friend in the series Game of Thrones, said she was "deeply" thinking about going over the issue.
Kit said, "I'm personally thinking deeply about this at the moment. What did we do wrong about masculinity?
When we look at this problem we are currently experiencing, what are we teaching them wrong when men are growing up?"
Kit believes that television can be a part of the strengthening of toxic masculinity due to over-masculine characters.
Kit continued to say: “What is born, what is taught, and what is taught?
What is taught to young men on television and on the streets that these young men feel they have to have certain characteristics of masculinity?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is: How can we change that?
It’s obvious that some things are not going well for young men.”
In an interview with Kit, he said he would not be able to play in episodes or sequels after the end of Game of Thrones next summer, and that he would no longer be bored with battlefields and horses.
Kit will play in Sam Shepard's re-enacted Wild West in November, which tells the story of a filmmaker and a thief's brother.
The actor recently announced that the most beautiful thing the Game of Thrones series has added to him was to meet his wife, Rose.
Kit said, "I met my wife on this show, so in a sense, she offered me my future family and my life after that."
Rose played the lover of the character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Kit.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of new cases
China said there was a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, the virus has affected more than 820,000 people in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Unlike in the past, most of the new cases have been reported to have been sexually transmitted.
In the past, the HIV virus has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But at a conference in the Greek state, Chinese health officials said the number of people caught with HIV by blood transfusions had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 each year.
The HIV virus, which is transmitted through sexual intercourse, is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality continues to discriminate against LGBT people despite being banned from crime in China in 1997.
In the study, it is estimated that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
The disease is contagious, mostly because not enough attention is paid to protection during these same-sex relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide general access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to combat the disease.
Maxine Waters, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories," rejected the claim that one of her employees leaked data belonging to Republican Party senators.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied any allegations that one of her employees shared the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party MP, Waters, said the allegations were backed by "extreme-right" political commentators and websites.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters used the phrase “Lies, Lies, and Lower Lies.”
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and U.S. Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch also have their home addresses and phone numbers.
This information about members of Congress was posted to the Internet on Thursday by an unidentified person during a Senate group session on allegations of sexual abuse against High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
According to reports in Hill, conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address belonging to the source of the shipments was linked to Waters' office, and published information from one of Waters' employees.
Waters used his statements on the subject, "These unfounded claims are completely false and untrue lies."
“The employee who jeopardizes identity, personal information, and security because of these false and unfounded allegations is not responsible in any way for the infiltration of this information.
These untrue claims are completely false and untrue lies.”
Waters' statement attracted some people's reaction on the internet, and White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was among those who expressed his reaction.
Fleischer wrote in his statement, "This is an angry lie."
“It shows that Waters doesn’t have the necessary incentive to be a Congressman.
You shouldn't be upset when someone is charged with a crime they don't commit.
Criticism should not be tolerated.
The person who inspires should not question the intentions of the person.
It needs to be calm and relaxed.”
With these words, Fleischer compared Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Waters, who was criticized by Democrats for appearing very angry at Thursday's session.
In the midterm elections, Republican Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Waters seat, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter:
"He's playing from the ground."
Waters said in a statement that the office had “informed the relevant authorities and the security agency about these false claims.”
Waters said in a statement, "We will ensure that the files are exposed and that they are accountable to the law for these dangerous actions that could harm all employees."
Johnny English Film Review: Rowan Atkinson's Insufficient Agent Parody
Now it has become a tradition to associate all new British-made films with Brexit. We can continue this tradition for the Johnny English action comedy parody, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and re-released in 2011 with Johnny English's Return to the White Curtain.
Will our ironic film, about how horrible we are, that we are smuggling ourselves into, be our country’s new export opportunity?
At least, the incompetent Johnny English character, who draws attention with his bursting eyes and moving imitations, has been able to renew his license to ruin everything once again. In fact, even the name Johnny English shows that the character is a comprehensive comedy object developed for non-English-speaking cinema lovers.
Johnny English, despite a bit of self-confident and ingenious charm from Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bean, and a little from the opening ceremonies of the London 2012 Olympics, is an absurd secret agent inspired by that character who accompanies the promotional music of Chariots of Fire.
In fact, for this secret agent role, Barclaycard TV commercials, which are now forgotten, were inspired by an international mysterious traveller who was inspired by Atkinson and ultimately created a chaos in every work he did.
You can find a few funny scenes in this new Johnny English movie.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter with a medieval battle armor and crashed into the shield of the helicopter propeller and made a sound.
Atkinson's physical comedy skills are eye-catching, but I found the element of humor in the film to be very weak and strangely unnecessary. Especially considering that "serious" films like 007 and Our Mission Danger also include comedy material in their scripts in a confident way, the film's humor is more likely to be included in the scripts.
The sense of humor in the film seems to be aimed at more children than adults, and I don’t think the odd misfortunes that happened to Johnny English’s character in Atkinson’s silent film comedy are as creative and thought-out misfortunes as Bean does.
In this film, the theme of the series is that Britain is in serious danger.
A cybercriminal, hacking into Britain's highly secretive agent network, reveals the identities of all agents working in the field in the UK and is horrified by the agent keeping the night watch. Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon, who relives the character of the watchman, is only in this small role in the film.
Political popularity is the last drop of this event for a self-loved prime minister who has come to a point of total extinction: Emma Thompson has done her best to bring this character to life as much as possible as Theresa May, but the script can work on and improve.
The prime minister’s intelligence advisers say that the prime minister has been told that all active agents are identified and that he must appoint a retired agent for this.
This retired agent is also incompetent Johnny English. Johnny English also gives lessons on how to become a secret agent while teaching at a school where rich students are studying after retirement: English's School of Rock has a type of agency academy. There are comedy scenes in these scenes where the rich students are studying.
English is immediately taken to Whitehall Palace for an emergency briefing, and is reunited with Ben Miller, a former scoundrel assistant.
Bough is married to a U-boat officer, and Vicki Pepperdine, who revived Bough's wife, has been a little wasted in this role.
The pair, known to have destroyed everything terribly in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are reunited with the beautiful femme fatale character Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister remains under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims that Britain can solve the cyber problem: this demonic character named Jason Volta is revived by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their adventures full of absurd fun: they enter into a waiter’s costume and set fire to a luxury French restaurant; they lead to chaos as they try to sneak into Volta’s luxury bed. English is trying to use a full plan of Volta’s house to learn.
All of these events are tied to a point at the end of the script, but no matter how cute and captivating the film is, it has a sense of humor in children's television programs in general.
The jokes are pretty boring.
I couldn’t help but think about it in this film, as in other Johnny English films: Can the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected claims that it has worked four days a week for British workers and developed a five-day pay plan.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to develop a radical plan that includes working four days a week, without any interruption in employees’ salaries.
According to rumors, the party wants corporate bosses to take advantage of the savings made through artificial intelligence by extending the week's holiday for another day.
According to the plan, employees will have three days of vacation per week but will continue to receive the same salary.
Sources of the news said the idea was "suitable" for the party's plans to steer the country to economic agendas and useful policies for workers.
The Congress of British Trade Unions also supports the offer of working four days a week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be carried out by the end of the year.
This is not a plan that can happen overnight, but the idea of working four days a week is a demand for a rebalancing of the party’s economy to the benefit of workers and a general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party was not the first party to bring this idea forward. The Greens Party had pledged to work four days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this request is not supported by the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day weekly work plan is not among the party’s policies and is currently not evaluated by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell detailed his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "uncertain managers" and "renters" in public services firms.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor, because the Labour Party government can make “interruptions” in the event of the bloodshed of corruption, also mean that the existing shareholders of water companies will not be able to take back all of their shares in the company.
McDonnell has also confirmed its plans for employees to take part in the company’s boards. Shadow Chancellor plans to create Comprehensive Property Funds to transfer 10% of private sector companies’ equity to employees. The ten-per-cent rate is up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 per annum.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy announced whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh would change their minds on 60 Minutes.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh led to a minimum of a week's delay in the final vote for the judge's candidacy for the Supreme Court. This investigation also reveals the findings of Republican senators in the FBI's report, which may appear in question.
In a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it was possible to come up with a finding that could change their mind in the FBI investigation.
Kennedy seemed more likely to change his mind than his South Carolina colleague.
In an interview with Kennedy, "Of course,
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh while I was sitting.
After that claim was made, I called him and I said, "Did you do this?"
Kavanaugh was brave, determined and clear," he said.
On the other hand, Graham seems less likely to change the game.
Graham said, “I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there must be a very serious charge to change my mind.”
Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford, who raised the claim, said, "Dr. Ford, I don't know what it is, but I know this: Brett, he absolutely denied this claim."
"Nobody who gave Ford his name can confirm this claim.
Thirty-six years have passed since the incident.
I don’t think there’s anything new to change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday. This festival is an annual music event hosted by extremely impressive stars. The mission of the event is as assertive as the least artists on the stage: to end poverty around the world.
Tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park for this year’s 7th Global Citizen Festival, raising awareness of the mission of both Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes to monitor the performances of artists and end extreme poverty by 2030, the main goal of the event.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. The Global Poverty Project is an international pressure group that hopes to end poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting poverty.
Those who want to attend the concert, if they do not want to pay for the VIP ticket, have to perform certain tasks or "meetings" to win a free ticket to the event. Among them, volunteer, send emails to world leaders to help other people to get help, seek out specific people to end poverty.
How successful was the 12-year-old Global Citizen Festival to achieve its goal?
Does giving people a free concert ticket really convince people to ask for action? Or is it a situation that makes people really feel that they are making a difference by signing a petition over the Internet or tweeting it?
The Global Citizen movement reported that its supporters had 19 million "measures" in which many different goals were demanded to be achieved since 2011.
According to the Global Citizen group, these actions have contributed to the disclosure of commitments and announcements reaching a total budget of more than $37 billion, and these commitments and announcements are intended to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group said 390 commitments and announcements were announced as a result of supporters’ actions in early 2018 and that at least US$10 billion had already been paid or raised.
The Global Citizen group estimates that the funds backed up so far directly affect the lives of around 649 million people worldwide.
Among the important organizations in the pledges is the UK-based association "The Power of Nutrition". The association aims to "help the children to grow by realizing all their potentials" after obtaining a grant from investors and a grant from investors and a grant from project practitioners. After receiving a grant from investors and a grant from investors, the association has created two jobs.
The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told audiences at a live concert in April 2018: "With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and supporters of Global Citizen, there is insufficient ordeal from which there can be social injustice."
According to the Global Citizen group, after more than 5,000 calls for action by the British government to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government will provide funding for the project The Power of Nutrition, which will be funded by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health.
In response to the Frequently Asked Questions section of the Global Citizen Festival’s website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
He said, “It’s going to be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we’ll fail.
But we will succeed because we are stronger together, like all civil rights movements before us and anti-discrimination movements.
This year in New York, Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will feature artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e.
The Interior Minister has announced that the U.S. can use the Navy for a “blockade” that will prevent Russian energy exports.
According to the Washington Examiner, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, said they could “necessarily” use the Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from reaching world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s intervention in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets, but Russia is conducting its operations in Syria on the legitimate call of the government.
Zinke said, "I think the goal of [Russians] intervening in the Middle East is to make energy deals, as in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
The minister also argued that there are various ways and means to combat this.
Zinke said, “We as the United States have the power to keep the seaways open thanks to our naval forces and, if necessary, we can shut down these roads so that Russian energy does not reach the markets.”
Ryan Zinke spoke to the participants at the event where the Consumer Energy Alliance group, which describes itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States, was organized.
Zinke went on to say that Washington’s approach to its relations with Russia and Iran was similar to that of the two countries.
“One of the economic options on our table about Iran and Russia is to pressure them and take their place in terms of energy,” Zinke said, describing Russia as a “one-stop-shop” country with its fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements were made on a mission launched by the Trump administration to replace Russian natural gas, a much cheaper alternative for European consumers, and increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
In the context of this mission, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are working to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. According to Trump, this project has made Berlin the "effect" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline project is only an economic project. This project will double the current pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s vigorous opposition to the project has only economic reasons, and that it is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, who met with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry at a meeting in Moscow in September, noted that "energy cannot be used as a means of repression and consumers must be free to choose the supplier they want."
The attitude of the United States attracted the reaction of Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Federation (BDI), one of Germany’s leading industrial organizations, called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin recently met with German Industry Federation President Dieter Kempf, who said: “I am very upset that third-party companies are interfering with our energy supply.”
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Says He Will ‘About’ Think About Candidacy in 2020 Presidential Race
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would consider her candidacy for president after the midterms.
Holyoke confirmed that Warren, who attended the Massachusetts municipal council meeting, would consider being a candidate.
According to a Hill report, Warren said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government system, and for that, a woman has to go to the summit.”
Warren said, “After November 6, I will think about your presidential nomination.”
Commenting on President Donald Trump's remarks at the city council meeting, Warren said Trump was "driving the country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy,” he said.
Warren, Trump and Trump’s High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh have been critical of the case.
In a tweet on Monday, the senator said: “The FBI must do an investigation before voting, of course.”
On the other hand, according to a poll announced Thursday, Warren does not want most of his own supporters to run for office in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “old” voters said the senator should not be a candidate.
Thirty-two percent are in favour of being a candidate.
The survey showed that the number of people supporting Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy was higher, while the percentage of those who supported Patrick's candidacy was thirty-eight percent, while the percentage of those who opposed his candidacy was forty-eight percent.
Other well-known Democratic nominees in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will have formally decided whether or not to be a candidate by January.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's TSSB at Donald Trump Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Track Palin was arrested on charges of violence against a woman on Monday night
Sarah Palin, speaking to listeners at Donald Trump’s meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said: “After they have returned to my son’s home country, I’m experiencing the hardships of post-traumatic stress disorder and the wounds our soldiers have brought with me.”
Palin argued that the arrest of his son reflected a "obvious fact that was invisible". Palin, his son and other gases related to the "slightly changed from the war and emotionally hardened" turn around in comparison to the sights of his fellows in the armed forces. This is the number of pilots and armies in the field of sight of the paratroopers.
Dan Bennett, a spokesperson at the Wasilla Police Centre, revealed on Monday that Wasilla had been arrested in Alaska with allegations that Track Palin had committed violence against women, tried to intervene in the reporting of a case of violence, and had a gun while he was alcoholic.
18 states and the District of Columbia support protests against new asylum policy
The eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, on Friday, representatives of 18 states and the Columbia region presented an expert report to the court in Washington, D.C., to support a refugee who opposes the new policy.
The full name of the plaintiff was not disclosed in the Grace versus Sessions case, which was launched by the American Civil Liberties Union in August to challenge federal politics.
Grace said her partner and "sons of pro-spirit gang members" had committed violence against her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum request on July 20.
Grace, she was spotted in Texas.
Lawyers who defended Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the home of a large number of people applying for asylum in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence.
Along with the new U.S. asylum policy, the 2014 Immigration Provisional Board decision, which allowed people fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum, was overturned.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "counts federal and international laws with state laws and no laws."
In the notification report, "Federal law states that all asylum applications must be bound by a decision in accordance with the specific situation and conditions of the request, and such a ban violates this principle," the statement said.
Lawyers also argued in the report that non-recognition of the right of entry to migrants under the new policy harms the U.S. economy, and immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions in June demanded that judges looking at immigration cases do not give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions, announcing the policy on June 11, said: "Those who are exposed to or afraid of being subjected to abuse because of their race, religion, observance, social group or political views and therefore those who leave their countries may apply for asylum."
"The asylum policy certainly does not aim to alleviate all the problems people face every day all over the world. Even if these problems are serious problems, the situation is the same."
In Palu, where the death toll has doubled, aid teams race in time to find survivors.
The situation is getting worse and worse for the survivors.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who tries to comfort her hot baby at a evacuation center in the city of Palu where hopes are depleted, said: “I feel very tense.
There's an ambulance carrying the bodies every minute.
We have a clean water shortage.”
The inhabitants of the city were seen returning to their destroyed homes, trying to collect the items damaged by the water and save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured in the disaster, and hospitals that were damaged in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were filled with wounded.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, with fractures in his spine and shoulder, were treated in the garden of Palu Military Hospital, where the injured were treated in front of the hospital due to the continued strong augmentation shocks.
Haris recounted in tears his feelings during the violent earthquake in the room he stayed with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
Haris told the Associated Press in an interview: “We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I guess I'm stuck under the wall debris, too." Haris and his family came to town to attend a wedding.
“I heard my husband asked for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Harassment Using "Propaganda Ads"
The official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad praising the mutual advantages of U.S.-China trade in a daily newspaper in the United States. A week after that, the U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of spreading its propaganda using American media.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid advertisement published by the China Daily in the state's top-selling newspaper Des Moines Register in Iowa last Wednesday. Trump began his statements by accusing China of interfering in the November 6th congressional elections. China's refusal to intervene.
According to U.S. officials speaking to Reuters, Trump’s accusation of trying to interfere in the U.S. election indicates that Washington has taken a new stage in the expanded campaign to pressure China.
It is common practice for foreign governments to publish advertisements aimed at promoting trade. However, due to the deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington, both countries impose high tariffs on each other for imports.
According to U.S. experts, the tariffs imposed by China in the early stages of the trade war were aimed at influencing exporters in states such as Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the longtime former governor of the U.S. state of Iowa, which exports agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in a post in which the Des Moines Register took a pen for Sunday's press, China "doubled its bullying by publishing propaganda ads in the free American media."
Branstad wrote: "The Chinese government is taking advantage of the principle of freedom of expression and the free press traditions of America by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda."
"On the other hand, when you go to a newspaper dealer in the streets of Beijing, you can see that there are few newspapers that publish opposition opinions and that the Chinese correctly reflect the different views of the country's difficult economic progress." You can not find any publication in the bottom line. Because the control of the Communist Party, the Communist Party of China
Branstad said in a statement that "one of China's leading newspapers has rejected the offer to publish its article," but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts Say Republicans With Kavanaugh Price Sketch Distract Women Voters Before Interim Elections
While the Republican Party’s leading names were backing and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts warned that Republicans would react especially to women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments of the people in this matter were quite strong, and there were statements showing that the majority of Republicans wanted to keep voting.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell Institute, said in an article published in Hill on Sunday that “such statements cannot be withdrawn.”
Reeher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona representative) will be able to take the hearts of angry voters to demand an FBI investigation at the last minute.
According to a Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, the forward-thinking group, who led MoveOn's senior advisory and national speaker on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will remember what happened in the future in November."
According to Mic, Republican Party members, who make up the majority of the Judiciary Committee, prefer to continue the nomination process for Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's remarks!" activists say, "In the Senate's corridors."
An unbiased political analyst, Stu Rothenberg, said: “Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will be out of the ordinary.”
Rothenberg said, “People say that enthusiasm and motivation are already high; that’s the idea.
But when they don’t like the president in contested constituencies, the motivation of female voters in the suburbs who don’t usually vote can increase even further.”
Before the public statement, which Ford described in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts argued that they could face a reaction if Republican Party members insist on approval.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican Party National Committee, said, “This issue has become irrelevant to the Republican Party.”
Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helped the Democratic Party in the election, told a news channel, "It's not just a matter of committee voting, final voting or whether Kavanaugh is a member of the Supreme Court. I'm also talking about how Republican Party members took up the issue."
On the other hand, the Americans seem to have split up on who they will believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, and the number of those who hold Ford's side is gradually increasing.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of participants said they believed in Ford’s statement, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh’s statement, either completely or partially.
In addition, 38 percent of participants thought that Kavanaugh was absolutely or probably lying during his statement, while the percentage of those who used the same expression for Ford was limited to only 30 percent.
According to a report in the Guardian, the FBI began investigating at least one more claim by Ford and one of the other complainants following Flake's request, the second complainant involved in the investigation being Deborah Ramirez.
Ford made a sworn statement last week at the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was 17 years old that he had been sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh, who was under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh showed him his sexual organs during a party during which they attended during their education at Yale University in the 1980s.
The Miracle of the World Wide Web Plans to Launch a New Internet Project That Will Compete With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is setting up a new startup that aims to compete with companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid provides users with the ability to determine where the data will be stored and which people can give access to what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a mixed joke that Inrupt's real intention was "to dominate the world."
Lee said about the startup, "We had to do this now."
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own “personal online data storage space” or otherwise known as POD.
This storage space can include contact lists, calendars, lists to be made, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
The app offers a similar experience of using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify from a single browser at the same time.
The unique feature that distinguishes the storage area of personal data from other technologies is that it gives the user the opportunity to fully control who can access what information.
The company calls this concept “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, the basic idea in founding the Inrupt company was to bring together the resources, processes, and appropriate skills that would help provide Solid for everyone’s use.
Berners-Lee, Bruce, is currently in charge of a security platform purchased by IBM, a community of developers and volunteer coders who are contracted to work on the project.
From this week onwards, technology developers from all over the world will be able to develop their own non-centralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he or his team did not discuss whether to “make a change with Facebook and Google that will overwhelm all business models in one night.”
Lee said, “We don’t want them to be allowed.”
Berners-Lee, in a post published on Medium on Saturday, explained Inrupt’s mission: “Providing the commercial energy and ecosystem that will help preserve the integrity and quality of the new web system built on solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and changed the internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become one of the prominent names in the network neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee, who started Inrupt, will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said, “I’m very optimistic about this new era of the Web.”
Bernard Vann is named a priest who won the Victoria Cross in World War I.
The only British Church priest who won the Victoria Cross as a contestant in World War I was mentioned in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann earned the right to take this notice in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
But four days later, when Vann was killed by a sharpshooter, he never learned that he was honored with Britain’s highest military fiance.
On Saturday, Rushden inaugurated the memorial to Vann's two grandsons at the Northamptonshire transit ceremony.
Vann's grandson, Michael Vann, said the monument's grandson's inauguration was a "perfect symbol" after 100 years of heroism honored by the military fiancée.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann allowed the battalion to cross the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very misty air, bullets and machine guns in the lead rain."
He then quickly ran towards the line of fire, "with great courage" he pulled forward the line of fire, and by walking alone on top of a saffron ball, he smashed the three people of the parishioner.
Colonel Vann was killed a month after the end of the war by a German sharpshooter on 4 October 1918.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann commented on his grandfather’s actions, “I know I will never reach him, but also a heroism that humiliates people.”
Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vann, left a wreath after a transition ceremony led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honour to be present at the passage ceremony" and that "a true hero's courage is proved by the support given by many people."
MMA fans who stayed awake to watch Bellator 206 all night long met Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you're standing up all night to watch the Bellator 206, and you're not given the opportunity to watch the actual event.
There were 13 fights on the list set in San Jose, six of which were on the Main Card and were broadcast live on Channel 5 throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
Audiences in the UK were shocked when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to meet at 6:00 a.m. when the broadcast was suddenly switched to the Peppa Pig cartoon.
Some spectators who did not sleep until the morning for the fight were not satisfied with the situation.
One of MMA's fans described the broadcast as a "bad joke" on Twitter.
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator marketing and communications department, had to switch to the channel line-up film because the content of the broadcast was not appropriate for the morning at 06:00, he said.
Schwartz said, "Yes, 'Peppa the pig' was published."
Scott Coker, chairman of Bellator, said they will work on timelines so that fans in the UK can watch future publications as well.
Coker said in a statement about the change in broadcasting: "I think we can most likely re-arrange the broadcast."
"But now it's Sunday morning in England and it's six o'clock in the morning. We can't solve this problem until Monday, according to our time, according to the UK.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages when we went to the comics, and some of those messages weren't very friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem because we thought it was a technical error.
But it's not a technical mistake, it's a matter of regulation.
I promise you next time, it won't happen again.
We're going to put five fights instead of six, as we normally do, and we've come across this problem as we're trying to deliver better to our MMA fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Explains He Feels Like a "Second-Class Man" Because of His Sexual Orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley explained that because of his sexual orientation, he felt like a second-class person but this feeling provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize “everyone is not like him” until he started high school.
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented for the first time by Lauren Laverne, Daley said the purpose of talking about gay rights was to give "hope" to others.
He also added that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a father.
Kirsty Young, the host of the long-awaited radio program, was released for several months due to her illness.
The first guest on this show was Daley, Laverne's first guest, who decided that guests were trapped on an island and wanted to take something with them. When Daley was growing up, he saw himself "beyond" everyone, because he "didn't care about a man's ass as much as he cares about both men and girls.
Daley said: “Until now, this sense of incompetence and the feeling of being different from everyone has given me the strength and stamina to succeed.”
The athlete, who said he wanted to prove that he was an “important person” in the past, thought he would not be disappointed when people learned his sexual orientation.
Two bronze Olympic medalists became a well-known LGBT advocate, and this year, at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, he called on more countries to stop homosexuality from being a crime.
Daley stated that she felt lucky because she did not face any legal issues because she explained her homosexuality, that she wanted to give “hope” to others, and that she therefore clearly expressed her thoughts on the subject.
The three-time world champion told a man that he fell in love with filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley was married last year to a 20-year-old Oscar-winning director, but the athlete said the age difference between them never caused any problems.
Daley, who attended the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and lost his father to cancer three years later, said it was difficult to find an age that had experienced similar landings in life "when he passed so much at a young age."
In June, the couple adopted a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who was happy to be a parent. After becoming a father, Daley said that "the whole point of view" had changed.
The athlete said: “If you had asked this question last year, the only problem I would have was getting a gold medal.”
But there are more valuable things than gold medals won at the Olympics.
The Olympic gold medal was Robbie for me.”
Daley's son is named after his father Robert, who was diagnosed with brain cancer and died in 2011 when he was 40.
According to Daley, he did not accept his father's death and one of the last questions he asked was whether they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to watch the games for the first time.
Daley said, "Dad, you can't live long enough to watch the games first."
Daley explained that his father was alive at the time of his death: "I was holding his hand the moment he stopped breathing, I really couldn't accept that he wasn't invincible until he took his last breath and lost his life."
The Olympic athlete competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics a year after his father's death and won a bronze medal.
As Daley told the Olympics, "I knew I'd dreamt of this all my life: jumping in front of my own country's fans. There wouldn't be a better feeling than that."
This also influenced Daley's choice of the first song. Daley's preference was Heather Small's Proud song, which meant a great deal to her while preparing for the Olympics and still shorning her hair.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 according to British Summer Time on Sundays.
Mickelson was knocked out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but must regain his form so that this record is not a sad turning point.
Participating in an event held every two years for the 12th time, Mickelson was taken away by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Five-time major champion, Mickelson would usually be at the center of events in the U.S. team, but he would spend Saturday congratulating the team or training on the field in the hopes of getting rid of the problem that caused his performance in the game.
Even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete who doesn’t have enough driver punches is not an ideal choice for the challenging Le Golf National park, where faulty punches in the long rough don’t go unpunished.
Mickelson will fight British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, as the parker himself is not tough enough. Molinari has also won four of the four matches this week with inexperienced teammate Tommy Fleetwood.
If the American team, four points behind before Sunday’s 12 singles game, can start the game quickly, Mickelson’s game will definitely be of great importance.
Furyk explained that he trusted his teammate, and it wasn't possible for him to say anything different.
The U.S. captain used the phrase for his teammate: "Mickelson had fully understood his role today, he said he would be ready for tomorrow by squeezing my back and throwing his arm on his shoulder."
"He's very confident.
Mickelson is an actor who has printed his name on the Hall of Fame, a name that adds a lot to the teams he played in the past and this week to our team.
I had no idea how to play him in two games.
I thought he was going to play more in the game, but it had to be this way, so we decided that we should continue the game that way.
Of course, Mickelson wants to be on the pitch like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most-played player in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
For Mickelson, this match could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which he has never fully achieved with his achievements on individual records.
According to Furyk, Mickelson gave the team a spiritual advantage with his presence; he won 18 games, lost 20 games, and stayed together in seven games.
Team captain, Mickelson said: "He has a comical, funny and funny personality. People like to joke around. He's a really great friend to spend time in the team room."
I think the young players were happy to get the chance to fight him this week, and it was fun to watch the fights.
He’s doing more than playing.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big difference can close in a short time.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn has previously experienced that getting ahead of singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup could easily turn into a disturbing combination.
The Danish player made his debut in Valderrama in 1997. In this match, the team captained by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans. But at the end of the match they won only with a very small nose difference such as 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
After watching the 2018 team win 5-3 at Le Golf National on both Friday and yesterday, Bjorn (pictured) made the following statement: "I always remind me of this in a very different way: in a different moment, in a different way, in a different way, in a different way in Valderrama.
History reminds me and the players of the rival team that nothing is over yet.
We'll play with full performance tomorrow.
We're gonna go out there and do everything we need to do.
It means nothing is done until the score is written in the scoreboard.
We have a goal, we're trying to win this cup, and that's the whole focus.
I’ve been saying the same thing from the beginning. My focus is on 12 players in my own team, but we all know who we’re fighting in the opposing team. We have the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of the players on the challenging golf course, Bjorn went on to say: "I'm never sure of myself in this game.
Tomorrow, a completely different day.
“Tomorrow, individual performances will come out and the things we need to do will change.
If all goes well, it's a great feeling to play with your partner, but when you go out on the field alone, you're being tested with all your capacity as a golfer.
This is the message we need to convey to the players: Show off the best you can tomorrow.
Now you need to leave your partner, and your partner needs to go out in the field and perform best.”
Competing team captain Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, expects players to perform better than their individual partner matches. This performance increase is not valid for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four matches.
Furyk, who was on both the losing and the winning sides of the teams' finals, was on the winning side in Brookline, where he was on the winning side in the European team's "Miracle in Medina" victory.
In 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw's response to the question of how he motivated his players on the final day, Furyk used his phrase, "I remember the word for what he said."
The captain of the American team went on to explain: “We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you have to start the game as fast as in Brookline or Medinah.
After the momentum passes on your side, the players in the middle of the matches are given a big task.
So we did our rankings according to that, and we showed the players that we thought the performance was high. You know, we're going to try to create a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has taken on the task of leading the counter-attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first match and the other players of the first day on the list of the European team are: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
Bjorn said about the players he chose for singles matches: “I chose to play the players I chose in this order because I think this order is suitable for all matches from start to finish.”
The date of entry into service of Germany’s new warship has been postponed once again.
The new German naval cavalry would replace warships from the Cold War period starting in 2014, but the cavalry will not be serviced until next year, according to local media reports, due to malfunctioning systems and rising costs.
According to a military source speaking to Die Zeit, the date of entry into service of the new Baden-Württemberg-class infantry admiral ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the German Navy in 2014, but the problems that emerged after the delivery did not leave the sidelines of the alleged project in any way.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the German Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class variants.
In addition to stealth technologies such as low-frequency radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, the ships were reported to have a powerful ball, a number of aircraft carriers and cruise missiles.
Other important features of the ship are the longer maintenance intervals. The new variants are expected to be able to serve up to two years away from the connecting port.
But according to Die Zeit news, the last model said that Germany would intimidate its forces to overseas countries will be outdated by the time warships enter service.
The unfortunate F125 was relocated to manuscripts last year after the German Navy formally refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the reverse Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy has returned the ship, which was delivered along with the incident, to the ship's manufacturer.
Detailed information on the reasons for the return was not provided. However, according to the German media, there was a number of critical "software and hardware errors" that would render the ship useless in the event of a combat mission.
The Baden-Württemberg-class ships are particularly important because the software errors will be used by 120 shipmen, equivalent to half the number of personnel employed in former Bremen-class vacancies.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reduced its performance, and restricted the ability of Navy personnel to make changes to the ship in the future.
The 7000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate was reportedly twice as heavy as ships in similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the perfect equipment, the cost of the entire project, which also includes the training of the staff, began to become a problem.
The project price is said to have risen from the starting price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (USD 3.6).
Despite warnings that Germany’s sea power is declining, the problems emerging in the new variants are also gaining importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged the "decrease in ships suitable for the German Navy."
The chairman of the defense committee said the problem grew over time, despite the fact that old ships were taken off service, due to the lack of new ships being placed in their places.
The president regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class variants were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust is a guest listener to the secret lives of bats.
A new study is underway in Scotland’s Highlands to understand how bats take advantage of the terrain during hunting.
The findings from the study are expected to shed light on the behaviors of bats, the only mammals that fly, and guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by scientists working at the Scottish National Trust for Scotland association, will also track quite a few dwarf mosquitoes and Mediterranean dwarf mosquitoes found in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared mosquitoes and Daubenton mosquitoes.
Special recording devices will be installed at important points of the land to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile work using the detectors they have obtained.
After the sound analysis of all the recordings is carried out by experts, the frequencies of the bat sounds will be determined by determining what type does what.
Afterwards, a habitat map and report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of the behaviors shown by bats across the land.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are more important for bats and how these areas are used by each type of bat.
This information will help to determine the best way to protect tree areas for bats and related species, as well as benefit habitat management work such as grassland creation.
In the last century there has been a serious decline in the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole.
Injuries are threatened by construction and construction works that affect their barrels and cause them to lose their habitat.
Other factors that pose a risk to injuries include wind turbines, lighting tools, cinematics, chemical processes used in some building materials, and attacks by cats.
Insects aren't actually blind.
But because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching their prey.
Injuries use an advanced ecolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles in the flight pathways.
The NTS bats responsible for the conservation of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country are of great importance.
The association regularly works with ten trained specialists who conduct research, tuna surveys and sometimes rescue activities.
The organization established Scotland's first and only shelter for bats on the Thrave grounds of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten different bat species.
The land manager David Thompson said that the land is an ideal area for bats.
Thompson said, "We have a great area for bats in Thraave."
Land Manager Thompson said: “We have old buildings, a lot of old trees, and we have a beautiful living space.
But we still don’t know much about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to thrive.”
Thompson underlines the need to check whether there are bats in buildings before they begin their maintenance work. The accidental destruction of a single maternal flare can lead to the death of nearly 400 female and puppy bats causing the entire local population to disappear.
Injuries are protected animals. It is forbidden to kill, disturb, or harm the animals or destroy their barrels.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish authority of the Bat Conservation Trust, invited people to contribute to the project.
Ferrell said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know what the populations of the many species that live in our region are."
Ronaldo's lawyers, who denied allegations of rape, are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "false news" and argued that people were trying to "make their own promotions" using the name Ronaldo.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the claims.
The Portuguese national team and Juventus forward Ronaldo allegedly raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to a report in Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo was charged $375,000 to keep the woman from talking about the incident later.
Hours after the allegations appeared in the media, 33-year-old Ronaldo, speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram, said the allegations were "false news."
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera, "No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is a lie.”
“They want to do their own advertising using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of it.
I'm a happy man, I don't have a problem," he added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on allegations they consider “inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "the spiritual damages corresponding to the magnitude of this violation, perhaps one of the most serious personal rights violations seen in recent years."
The bet is said to have taken place in a room at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga are alleged to have gone to the footballer's room after meeting at a nightclub and raped Mayorga.
Mayorga argues that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told him he was "a good man" at "99 percent" and betrayed "one percent."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual relations, but that it was within the consent of the two parties.
The mayor argues that he went to the police and later accepted an out-of-court settlement because he was "afraid of being treated" and was "afraid of being humiliated in front of the public".
The 34-year-old mayor says he is looking for ways to break the deal because his trauma is still under the influence of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giant Juventus for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will "always regret" that it has lost its automakers
Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said Britain will "always regret" if it loses its position of world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit.
Toyota also added that it was "disturbing" to announce that Britain would temporarily suspend production at the Derby plant near Burnaston in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal.
Clark said, "We need to make a deal."
The Japanese automaker said that an extension of the waiting time at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause people to lose their jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced 150,000 vehicles exported to the rest of the European Union last year, 90%.
Marvin Cooke, head of Toyota's Burnaston plant, said: "If my view is withdrawn from the EU at the end of March, I will stop producing at our factory."
Car makers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have also raised fears about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are based on what automakers pose as risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line works on the “full-time” principle with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom cars.
If the UK withdraws from the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be a customs dispute, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and parts not being supplied.
The company said it was impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of inventory at the Derbyshire facility, so production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan was “clearly tuned in terms of future relations with the EU to avoid these border controls.”
On BBC Radio 4's Today program, he said, "We need to make a deal. As I said, we want to make the best deal that will not only bring us success for now, but that will allow us to seize this opportunity."
“According to evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers, we should definitely be able to continue our highly successful supply chains,” he said.
Toyota could not determine how long production would last, but warned that overtime costs would reduce the facility’s competitiveness in the longer term and ultimately leave people unemployed.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at Burnaston and the unit’s unit meeting organizer, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these things will never come back when they disappear.
A government spokesman said: “We need to put forward a clear and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House: Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
On Sunday, the White House said the big meeting with Donald Trump’s Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein “could be postponed by another week” because of the ongoing debate over High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s election intervention, Trump’s ties with Russia’s aides, and the possibility of impeding the president’s justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months that Trump would endanger Mueller's independence and would not remove his assistant secretary of state.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein had put on a listening device to record his talks with Trump and debated the issue of taking the president out of office with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But on Monday, he went to the White House among his claims that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would be held on Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "prefers not to fire Rosenstein" but then the meeting was postponed so as not to interfere with the Senate Justice Commission trial between Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the two women who accused her of sexual abuse and applied for her statements.
On Friday, Trump again postponed the full vote of the Senate by ordering the FBI to investigate allegations of Kavanaugh for a week.
Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said, "There may be no date for this this week, but if everything else in the Supreme Court is taken into account, it is possible to postpone another week.
But we'll see. I always want to let the press know about the developments," he said.
Some reporters object to the statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The show's host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reason for the lack of briefings was not TV reporters playing "tribunes" but added: "But I can't deny that they played tribunes either."
Sanders later suggested that direct contact with Trump and the press would increase.
"Trump is organizing more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said. He also added, "We examined the digital data," without giving any source.
Sanders said: "Brifings will continue, but if the press has a better chance of directing questions about the United States to the president than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you've seen us do it many times in recent weeks, and when you can talk directly to the President of the United States, that's going to take the place of the press briefing."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions he holds with high-ranking visitors or press conferences.
Solo press conferences don't happen often.
The president may have shown the reason for this by speaking too freely in front of reporters gathered in New York this week and giving strange images from time to time.
The Minister of Health has written a letter to EU employees at the Scottish NHS about their concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU employees at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude for the country and ask them to continue working in the post-Brexit period.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government had already promised to take on the cost of certain location applications for EU citizens who work in transferred public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “The withdrawal talks between the UK and the EU have been going on throughout the summer and have opened the way for the expected decisions to be made this fall.
But the British government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal deal.
I am aware that this is a very difficult time for all of you.
So I wanted to express once again how much I value the contributions of every member of our staff working in any country.
While our colleagues in the EU and abroad are strengthening and improving their health care work, they also offer valuable experience and skills that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would love you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie Injured from Head Surgery
According to Mike Organ in Tennessee, Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie was rushed to surgery on his head from a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred in a short period of time between the circuits.
Reed said, "He came to the edge of the field and piled up where he was."
Workers and health care staff took the footballer to a sledgehammer after oxygen was given to Abercrombie at the edge of the field.
An official from Tennessee State told WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Chris Harris was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also added that "not yet detailed about the type/type of injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
The second year of college, Abercrombie transferred from Illinois to Tennessee State for his second season.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, the player who played the ball five times in total increased the number of rounds in the season to 18.
Higher stamp duty will be levied on foreigners who acquire real estate in the UK
A higher stamp tax will be levied on real estate in the UK from foreigners, and this surplus will be used for homeless within the new Tory plans.
This move will invalidate Corbyn's success in his efforts to attract young voters.
Reduced stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance predicts <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year will be raised to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that more stamp taxes will be levied on foreign buyers while buying real estate in the UK, to help more homeless people.
This move is seen as an attempt to undo the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to provide more affordable homes by targeting high-income buyers.
The tax levy will be provided to non-taxable persons and firms in the UK. This additional fee will contribute to the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
Two years ago, second homes and high taxes on real estate received by foreigners could also find three percent of this fee, in addition to the existing stamp tax.
The Ministry of Finance predicts that this initiative will bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
In London, it is estimated that 13 percent of the new generation of real estate is acquired by people outside the UK, which makes it difficult for first-time buyers to raise prices.
Because of foreign buyers who spent most of their time abroad, many affluent regions in the country, especially the regions in the capital, became "family cities."
The new policy came to the fore a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut so that more young people could buy their first homes.
Johnson accused large construction firms of talking to the lands early and later not using them, raising real estate prices, and invited May to remove quotations in affordable homes to eliminate this "property residual" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a number of notable housing reform proposals aimed at ending evacuations that also cover rental inspections and are “unforgivable.”
He also wants more power to be given to councils to build new homes.
May said: “I said last year that I would commit my prime ministership to reinvigorating the British dream, which is to make life even better for all future generations.
This also requires repairing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not true that people who do not live in the UK and companies of foreign origin can get home as easily as British citizens who work here.
It has been a very powerful dream for many people to own a home, and such a low-risk situation as homelessness is very real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to become Scotland's director"
Sunderland Technical Director Jack Ross said that at one point the "greatest goal" was to make Scotland's technical director.
The 42-year-old Scottish director enjoys his fight to revive the Northeastern club, which is third behind three points from the top in League One.
After last season's St. Mirren was brought to the Scottish Premiership, he moved to Light Stadium this summer.
Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound, "I wanted to play football in my country.
I got a baseball cap, that's all," he said.
"But when I was a kid, my father and I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden a lot, which has always attracted me.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in the technical directorate.”
Sunderland's previous technical directors before Ross include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technical director of Alloa Athletic, who has rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town in the past, said he never hesitated to work for names rooted in such a large club.
“For me, success at the moment is only measured by the answer to the question, ‘Can I return this club to the Premier League again?’
"In terms of the structure and the facilities at the club, this club is undoubtedly the Premier League."
“It’s not easy to get there, but the only way I can count on being successful here is probably to get the club there.”
Ross, who has been an assistant coach at Dumbarton for a period of 15 months and is in charge of the coaching staff at Hearts, is in his third year as a technical director.
Ross also saved Alloa from falling into the squad and placed third in the league, turning St. Mirren from the threshold of falling into the squad and winning the following season's Championship title to a top squad.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than he did when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
About the time Alloa was at the beginning, he said, "It was probably a real turning point."
"I really believe that the technical directorate is the right choice for me than playing football.
It may sound strange because I play well, I earn reasonable deposits, and I have good times.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many stages that you need to go through each week.
I’m still experiencing the same things in terms of work stress and pressure, but the technical director feels so good.
I've always wanted to be a technical director. Now I'm fulfilling this wish and I'm at the most comfortable time of my whole adult life.

The study found that the best time for beer was 17:30.
The burning heat of the summer has put more pressure on the chain restaurants as it increases the income of Britain’s trouble bars.
According to numerical data, sales of pub and bar groups rose by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a digital data collector and CGA financial advisor, said: “Continuous sunlight and Britain’s longer-than-expected competition at the World Cup, when the restaurant revenues rose by 2.8 per cent in July, I recalled that restaurants received a deep blow in June.
In June, a 1.8 percent drop in restaurant work volume took place, and in July, it got worse.
Drink-heavy pubs and bars, like the others, earned more than restaurants lost revenues, showed the best open-ended performance.
In addition, food-heavy pubs were not as serious as restaurant operators, although they were damaged by heat.
People seem to just go out to get something to drink.
“Food sales in processed pubs and bars fell by three percent this month, while beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent.”
RSM entertainment and accommodation analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of important social or sporting events continue to be the biggest factors in terms of sales in the homeless market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, in addition to cost pressures, despite a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst possible time for heavy-duty businesses, and it will show time whether the more moderate weather we see in August will provide the needed relaxation, or not."
The total increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand releases.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industrial sales tracking system for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK collects and analyzes data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. Coffer Peach is a well-known benchmarking company in the industry.
One in five children has a social media account that they keep secret from their parents.
One study found that one in five children starting at the age of 11 had social media accounts that they kept secret from their parents and teachers.
Research conducted among 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta" accounts
This development has heightened concerns about sexual content-sharing being done
Twenty percent of students said they had a "mother" account to show their parents
Every child starting at the age of 11 opens hidden social media accounts from their adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students, "fake Insta," the photo sharing site Instagram, highlighted the increase in their accounts.
This development has heightened concerns about sexual content-sharing being done.
Twenty percent of the students said they showed their parents that they had clean "mother" accounts as well as special one accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a gang forcing others to "rape" her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many young families and teachers are aiming to create areas of the internet where they can’t find them.”
Next Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected as an independent member of the community’s board of directors at the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle, Scotland’s most equipped athlete and president, Ian Beattie, said it was a great opportunity for those who focused on sports to take advantage of the athlete’s decades of international experience.
Beattie said, "Eilidh has great respect for Scotland, the UK and the world athletics community. Bringing him to the board will make a great contribution to Scottish athleticism."
Doyle said: “I’m ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute to Scottish sport and give direction.”
The American, who won the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 in the 200 metres and 400 metres, won four gold medals in total, and is now an expert at the BBC, became immobile following his temporary ischemic attack.
The athlete tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago today.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I got better, I'd know how long I'm going to get better.
It was a difficult process, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again. Today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your support messages!”
Breast pump advertising that resembles cows splits the internet
Breast pumping company, similar to cows that are breastfeeding mothers, has split the internet in two with advertisements.
Consumer technology firm Elvie has released a funny ad inspired by a clip to show the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers, for the launch of its product, which is said to be "the world's first wearable silent breast pump."
Four real moms dance in a cow barn with a song that reads, “Yes, I suck my own milk but I don’t have a tail” and “If you don’t mind, these are not cow breasts, these are my breasts.”
The motto of the song is, "I'm feeding the pumps, the pumps, the babies, the pumps, the pumps, the milk."
However, it has led to controversy on the company’s Facebook page.
It received mixed responses from video viewers who watched 77,000 times and made hundreds of comments. Many people said that the video presented the "horror" of the dairy industry.
One viewer said, “It’s a very bad decision to use cows in advertising for this product.
They, like us, have to get pregnant and give birth to them, but they are taken from their hands a few days after the puppies are born."

Another wrote this comment: “It’s obviously shocking for both the mother and the puppy.
But why shouldn't babies be used in breast pump advertising for mothers who don't get their hands off?
Another one wrote, "It's a far-fetched advertisement from the world."
And some of them were advocating, saying a woman thought the song was "very funny."
Someone said, "I think it's a very creative idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy it from this pump.
Pumping milk really made me feel like a cow.
It's a bit of an ad, but I got the message.
It’s a very smart product,” he wrote.
Another said, “This is mostly an advertisement for mothers who feel like cows when they pump milk in their workplaces or toilets.”
It’s not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry or feeds it.”
At the end of the video, all women are dancing with their breast pump attached to their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk feel like cows.
But Elvie Pumpa is completely silent, has no cable, no tubes, and sits fully inside the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move while pumping milk, to hold their babies, or even to go outside.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie Pompa was such an innovative product that she deserved a bold and challenging introduction.
By making similarities between breastfeeding mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to pump milk in a fun and understandable way while demonstrating the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will provide, and take out all the challenges of this process.
Elvie Pompa is not my first time.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mother used the product to go to the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although monthly border crossings haven’t changed much, the number of fugitive children has risen rapidly due to their tough talk and policies to make it difficult for the Trump administration to place children with its sponsors.
Usually sponsors are people who are also fugitives in time and who are afraid to put themselves at risk by having children in their own country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and adults in the home had to give a fingerprint and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officer Matthew Albence said the organization had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor non-verbal children against Congress.
The institution later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a record.
“Roughly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or from the family of sponsors are illegal in this country, and the majority are foreign criminals.
We won’t leave these people behind.”
Asylum workers have introduced new rules that require officials to go to court within a month instead of 60 days after some of them are arrested to see the children's case faster.
Many will defend the immigration judge in their cases about their legal status rather than going to court in person with a conference meeting.
Those who are not eligible for release will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and news from the system in recent months, the more children are detained, the more likely they are to experience anxiety disorder and depression, which can lead to anger explosions or attempts to escape.
Lawyers said these concerns are rising in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where the child’s symptoms of being in trouble are likely to be overlooked depending on size.
They also noted that sending them to the tent camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare them or say goodbye to their friends could trigger traumas that many already suffer.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish “employment forces” should immediately withdraw
Foreign Minister Velid El Muallim, speaking to the UN General Assembly, called for Syrian refugees to return, even though the country was in its eighth year of war.
At the same time, the Deputy Prime Minister said that foreign forces are illegal in Syria on the grounds of combating terrorism and that "what is needed will be done about it."
He said, "They must be withdrawn immediately, unconditionally."
The scientist claimed that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more are homeless since 2011, “the war on terror is almost over.”
“This holy struggle will continue from all the lands in Syria until both the terrorist groups and all the illegal aliens are cleared,” he said.
The U.S. has close to 2,000 military units in Syria against Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian Arabs, who are training and informing them.
France's war victims have more than 1,000 units in the country.
He said conditions were appropriate for refugees to return, and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "immeasurable fears" that would lead to refugees staying away from the country.
"We have called on international mosques and humanitarian aid agencies to ensure returnees," he said.
"They're just politicizing what should be a humane issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no development aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats said the agreement to create a buffer zone for Idlib, the last major insurgency stronghold between Russia and Turkey, created an opportunity to hold political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the three-million-strong region.
But the scholar stressed that the agreement was "net expiry dates" and said he hoped that the military action targeting militants, including fighters on the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, would be "removed."
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura wants to organize the first meetings of a new council of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
The Council of Scientists called for conditions for the participation of the Syrian government and warned against interventions, saying that the panel’s function should be limited by “reviewing the articles of the existing constitution.”
Why Trump will win the election for the second time
According to this logic, Trump will win the 2020 new election if he doesn’t misuse the role of liberal viewers as he probably hoped and lead to an early end to the scandalous presidency.
This will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of all time for the presidency!"
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's rating has doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's rating has tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News's 1.7 million viewers in the golden hours four years ago now average 2.4 million. The "Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC's Main News Nights draws headlines with 3.5 million viewers.
Neal Baer, the head of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," told a minister who was presiding over an attack on the congressional building, "It's not something we understand because it's a fire that draws people to themselves."
Experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club has another theory.
He remembers an incident in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told Scovell he'd give the game to Trump.
The writer asked, "Why?"
The driver said, "Because he's laughing at me."
Kaosta's worth the fun.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, events from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be found, and the state of the global economy.
Staying away from my day is just a luxury with the power of highly privileged viewers.
But experts on the panel suggest that Bob Woodward uses "detailed information" as a way of reference in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar leather bomber jacket (he takes a kind of undergarment on his watch, according to the Washington Post's definition of a proud dress, and his mother's trump's t-shirt.
I can't look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.

Foreign money flows to the most difficult midterm elections the White House has attended
It’s no surprise that two officials in congressional districts are running for the same position as a result of the vote slippage in Pennsylvania’s 17th district.
The newly-regulated Pittsburgh suburban area is putting Democratic MP Conor Lamb, who participated in last spring's election in another area, into the race.
Lamb is competing against Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th region of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th region.
The maps were re-drawn in October because the High Court ruled that the old areas were set in the interest of Republicans as opposed to the constitution.
The main party funding branches in the new 17th district are the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), which are split between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name after winning the March special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th District, which was followed by a lot of people.
There was a Republican in that position for more than a decade, and President Trump had won the region by 20 points.
Politicians have provoked the Democrats a little bit.
U.S. Refuses to Punish El Salvador on Support for China
The diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama already know Beijing, and that Washington has also reacted slightly.
Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s administrative team.
In a statement earlier this month, State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert decided to recall the U.S. officials in the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "new decision taken by the ministry officials not to recognize Taiwan anymore."
But the sanctions were envisaged to be applied to El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support alone.
The sanctions, which cover financial aid cuts and target visa restrictions, would be devastating for the country of Central America and high unemployment and murder rates.
As meetings in the ministry continue, North and Central American officials postponed the top-level conference on security and economic development, seen as an improvement in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the U.S. as a continuation of a similar meeting last year.
But by mid-September, senior executives said they wanted the conference to move forward and did not leave any draft sanctions for El Salvador.
Diplomats said that as an indication of the administration's importance to the meeting, Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to speak at the conference in mid-October.
Three U.S. representatives peacefully returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesperson for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was identified by three US officials, two diplomats who agreed to conduct internal negotiations on condition of confidentiality.
The authorities’ statements were supported by an analyst from outside the Palace, who was close to the administration and spoke on condition of confidentiality.
Learn the history
Another expected development special counsel, Robert Mueller, may have written a report on the possibility of Trump’s obstruction of justice, which is quite supportive evidence in the archives.
Mueller’s investigation was reported as to whether Trump’s election campaign was linked to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will once again find himself forced to hold himself accountable to this community as he prepares for the election of a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possibilities, and I'm not claiming that the fall of Trump or his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
There are choices to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic to determine how long the fight will take.
In 1938, if the West had resisted Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, German officers would be ready to strike.
We failed, and we couldn't stop years of massacres.
History is shaped around such turning points, and the unstoppable progress of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are currently living together on several of these turning points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump takes over Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been facing serious problems since last year's document, which claimed that he secretly proposed to record the president's meetings and revealed rumours that the president was not fit for office, emerged.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times' statements are incorrect.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s investigation, which has recently been requested from the FBI, is comprehensive and fair, or if he is found innocent in the High Court despite serious allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
On the one hand, in the midterm elections, are we going to vote for a House that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will go through a difficult process.
But I don't believe we're going to fail, because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was once a Czechoslovak Jew sent to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who invaded my embassy.
He came out alive, migrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to burn the Sabbath candles on that table with a gleaming cross on it.
How can I be hopeless about our future when we have such a past?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers hopes after Rapid Vienna clash
Following the impressive partnership they had with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the Rangers are weighing Rapid Vienna on Thursday and stepping up a lead from the Group of the European League in the event of their winning departure from their matches with the Austrian team.
Due to a disability in the knee, midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to play in the field until the season ended with Villarreal and finished 2–2, but the situation could be used as a jumping board for larger tasks for the team, according to the player.
The 31-year-old said: “This was a good score for us because Villarreal is a good team.
“We went to the game and we left with a point, believing we could get a good result.
Maybe we could get a better result, but together, it was probably a fairer result.
In the first half they were probably better than us but in the second half we came forward and played better.
Thursday is approaching, and there will be another great European night.
We hope to get three more points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result from their last games, but I'm sure when the spectators are behind us we can force them to get a positive result.
“My disabilities and the changes the club has experienced last year have been really difficult but I think our current position is very good.
Our team is good and everyone really enjoys it; the workouts are going well.
I hope we continue this way and leave the last season behind and we will be successful.”
Women are sleepless with fear of retirement accumulation
Although the participants in the study had clear ideas about how they wanted to take care of themselves, very few were talking to their families about it.
According to a study conducted by Nationwide, nearly half of the respondents spoke to their spouses about long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, said: “People want a family individual to take care of themselves, but they’re not taking any steps to talk about it.”
You can start with this one.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t say what you want, you can’t prepare your family for how they will look after you in the future.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and what kind of care you want, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Consult with your financial advisor: Your advisor can also offer you a solution to meet these costs.
A traditional long-term maintenance insurance policy can be among your payment options for long-term maintenance as long as you have a mixed cash-value life insurance policy that will help you meet your expenses or as long as you have money.
Completing legal documents: Resolving legal issues from the start.
Prepare a health insurance so that you have chosen someone you trust to manage your health services, and in cases where you are not able to communicate, you are guaranteed that the employees will meet your wishes.
Also, try to appoint a deputy to do your financial management.
You also want to make sure that your bills are paid for when someone you trust and you can’t make your financial decisions.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an urgent health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about this person asking you about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan and so be prepared for everything.
"It's not about the financial issues, it's who the doctors are going to be," Martin asked.
"Which treatment will be followed?
Who will look after the dog?
Make a plan for this.”
A man in Ilfracombe fired a cool gun
At night, a man walking from the outside to his house was shot several times.
The 40-year-old victim was shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, at the time.
Police said the incident that took place at 2:30 a.m. English Summer Time was a "random action".
The victim said he didn't see the assailant.
It's not a lethal injury, and the police are collecting witnesses' statements.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said on Friday that at least 384 people died in the Indonesian city of Palu as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami. In addition, the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communication channels, aid workers have yet to receive any news from Donggala, which is located north of Palu and the central base of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region. It is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and has an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongglaa is a naif with a length of more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
It is estimated that the administrative district, which is located under a province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the economy of the freezing coastal region.
Nickel mining in the villa is also important, but the mining is concentrated in Morowali, off the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, there has been a tsunami disaster in Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, another tsunami killed nine people in the Pacific Ocean.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Circle of Fire, which is seismically active, and earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are some serious earthquakes and tsunami disasters that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a tsunami struck 14 countries off the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, killing more than half of the 226,000 people in Aceh.
2005: Severe earthquakes in late March and early April hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast of the island and killed about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province, at 7.6 magnitude.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the outskirts of Sumatra caused a tsunami approaching 10 meters, causing the destruction of dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A flat quake in the Pidie Jaya neighborhood of Aceh brought destruction and panic to minds by the deadly damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time a tsunami was not triggered, but more than 100 people lost their lives due to the buildings that were destroyed.
2018: Severe earthquakes on Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok have killed a large proportion of 500 people north of the island.
The quake caused thousands of buildings to collapse and thousands of tourists to be trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Former Alaska governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday, Wasilla, a 29-year-old Alaskan Palin, was arrested for domestic violence, a report on domestic violence, and police violence.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a woman who was trying to call the police in order to report the charges.
According to KTUU, Palin is currently holding an unsecured bond of $500 at the Mat-Su Preliminary Trial Facility.
He said he was "absolutely innocent" when he was asked to defend himself in court on Saturday.
Palin faces three different Class A misconduct charges and can therefore be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
There is also a Class B indictment about him, which could result in a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't Palin's first criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
He's currently facing the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, domestic violence was reported to have been involved in a report on domestic violence and, in connection with the same incident, was subject to substance abuse.
His girlfriend claimed to have punched Palin in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by the Gazans in 2016 for her son's violent behavior following her service in Iraq to the TSSB.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and as a result, thousands of homes were destroyed.
Electricity and communication channels are currently not available and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the center of Sulawesi, the capital of Indonesia, in northeastern Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of the disaster are shared on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors ask for a death sentence that is rarely enforced for a suspected NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in a terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, which has rarely been applied for federal crimes in the city since 1953.
According to the allegations, in October, 30-year-old Saipov rented a truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road on the West Coast Highway of Lower Manhattan and crushed cyclists with the feet facing it.
According to New York’s document of intent to legitimize the death penalty, which is reported in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors need to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicting serious physical harm on people.
According to court documents, these two crimes bring together a probable death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury indicted Saipov with a 22-story allegation that included a charge of violence, the charge of destruction of motor vehicles, and 8 counts of murder for the purpose of blackmail. In addition, the charge is usually used in the lawsuits organized by federal prosecutors.
Prosecutors said the attack should be “largely planned” and said Saipov’s actions were “disgusting, ruthless, immoral.”
In the report, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and injury; the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco were drowned."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's Southern District has been sentenced to death for the last ten years.
Accused Khalid Barnes was accused of killing two drug suppliers, but as a result he was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
In a federal case in New York City, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death in 1953, and the married couple were charged with spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago and were executed.
The Rosenberg couple were executed on June 19, 1953, sitting on an electric chair.
According to court documents, the Uzbek Saipov did not show any signs of regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police statement, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the allegation, Saipov said he was inspired by an ISIS video he watched on his phone to carry out the attack on the authorities.
According to the police, he even wanted to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He said he did not accept the offences in the 22nd indictment.
David Patton, the federal defense official who represented Saipov, said the decision was “unfortunate, of course.”
Patton said: "We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty on the witness without being released will extend the trauma of all the people involved in the case even further," he said.
Saipov's defense team has asked prosecutors not to be put on trial before.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be brought to the fore of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed at a Tory conference today that he would "actually mobilize his public army."
While Theresa May, one of her own MPs, said she should go ahead with talks with the EU, the former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the pressure coming from European Union opponents.
Conservative opposition MP Peter Bone said on a walk in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had not been Brexit Secretary, the UK would have "been out by now."
The Tory, who was in favour of staying in the EU for another anti-Brexit march in the city, drew six points that Ms. May was having trouble reconciling deeply divided party members.
The prime minister has been struggling to ensure that Brexit supporters, EU supporters and the EU keep their party’s plan between the attacks coming from itself.
Their allies insist that despite the coming reactions, they continue to work towards a deal with Brussels and force their opponents to make a choice between the “chaos” with the plan presented by the EU and the Labour Party.
Mr. Bone said he wanted to "empty the Checkers House" during the Leave Means Leave walk in Solihull.
Mr. Farage said that he should have an interview with Brussels and take responsibility.
“If he had been in charge of these talks, we would have left the EU by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will make an effort for Brexit, but we need to evacuate Chequers."
The EU expressed its opposition: “We did not give the world wars to turn into a child.
We want to put our own laws in our own country.”
After the 2016 vote, Mr Bone denied allegations that the public had changed its mind: “The views of the British people have changed and want to stay in the EU are completely unfounded.”
Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of Brexit and Tory, was also on the march and spoke to reporters: “I’m just saying: Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people.”
Chequers are not loved by the people, they will not take the game of opposition, they are not loved by our party and activists who allow us to get elected.
Please leave Chequers and open your ears."
She added to the message targeting Ms May: "Prime Ministers can't hold their positions unless they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said on the march that when politicians consider betraying the decision made in the 2016 referendum, they should “feel the bass on them.”
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people and the politicians," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say ‘we won’t let you do that.’”
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want to feel the pressure on our politicians on the verge of betrayal to Brexit.”
"We are trying to mobilize this country's people's army, which allows us to win in Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, EU supporters held a two-hour rally in the city centre after their walks inside the city of Birmingham.
After the group's inauguration this weekend, a group of activists waved the flags "Torys Against Brexit".
Workers’ Party member Lord Adonis criticised the Conservatives for security over the intrusion into the sanctity of a party’s practice during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use all the technologies for IT systems and for seamless borders for Canada and for unlimited free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete mess.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to do a “deep review” of being a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she plans to conduct a "deep review of how to be a presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe said on Saturday that a member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party was talking about plans for the future in a municipal building west of Massachusetts.
Often criticizing President Donald Trump, Warren will compete against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, the co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign in the November election.
There were rumours that Warren could run against Trump in 2020.
The event, held at Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, was Warren’s 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump’s inauguration.
One participant asked him if he was a candidate for president.
In response, Warren said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix the corrupt government and include a woman taking a place at the highest level of the state.”
A person from LSU has been arrested for the shooting of Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in connection with the incident at 11 a.m.
Police, who posted a video of the armed conflict on Friday, asked citizens to help identify a man in the images.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday early in the morning near the campus of Southern University.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, "It is clear that Wayde Sims was shot from the head."
It was reported that Wayde had come together to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
In his interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene, carried a gun, and shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was unintentionally arrested in the East Baton Rouge neighborhood police department.
Growing up in Baton Rouge and a 6-foot 6-inch-long kid, the Sims played a total of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebound averages in the top 5 of 32 games last season.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton races for World Championship after leaving Sebastian Vettel on the team's orders
In Saturday's race, it turned out that from the moment Valtteri Bottas took over Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the pole position, maintaining his position in the first two laps, forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel, who first entered the pit stop, then left Hamilton behind, which could have been the move that ended the race.
The Mercedes team, which entered the pit stop on the next lap, came behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward by allowing the driver to leave the inside, even if he did not want to, after a double close move, which forced the Ferrari driver to defend in the third lap.
Max Verstappen, who started the race at the back of the line and celebrated his 21st birthday, finished seventh at the end of the first round.
Later, aiming for a quick finish, Kimi led a large part of the race at the cost of burning his tyres to pass fourth-ranked Raikkonen.
Verstappen entered the pit stop in the 44th lap but did not increase his speed in the remaining eight lap and Raikkonen did not take fourth.
"It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two in order.”
The body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said that Christine Blasey Ford's Constitutional Court did not leak a letter that accused candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what happened in the Senate saw people as “bad and lying.”
“The only thing that can happen and the good thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is to see people angry, angry, evil and dishonest,” Trump said.
You look at the published and leaked information, but they're like, "I didn't.
It wasn't me."
"Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak information?
And don't forget the woman's answer, did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak it.”
Wait a minute.
We leaked it? We didn’t leak it,” Trump said.
Feinstein received a letter in July detailing allegations of sexual harassment from Ford to Kavanaugh, which had been leaked to the press in September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his own office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee, "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, nor did I leak his story."
"Dr. Fort asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it as secret as he wanted."
Yet this denial, according to what he said at his meeting on Saturday night, did not satisfy the president: "Look what I'm going to tell you. Body language was really bad.
It may not have leaked, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who went on to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of being sexually abused by three women, argued that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
"They're determined to try every way to regain power."
"You see how they do evil to gain power and control. They don't care who they hurt or who they crush," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two Giants goals against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars on Saturday compensated for Friday's Elite League defeat by winning a 5-3 draw at Dundee.
The Giants scored two zeros at the start of the match with goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie's host team moved in together, but Dwyer's goal was again ahead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored again for Dundee but Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
The match in Belfast was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the students of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2–1 after losing again on Friday.
This was the fourth match of the two teams this season. The previous three games were won by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came from Kendall McFaull's assist in the fourth minute of the match at 03:35. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier doubled the difference.
In the intense first period, Sullivan scored the home team's goal at 13:10, then Matt Marquardt scored Cownie's equivalent goal at 15:16.
At the end of the first period, Dwyer scored the second goal of the night, leading the Giants into the circuit.
The home team picked up and Bouchard's goal at 27:37 again equaled the score.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to make Nielsen advance against Dundee for the first time at the end of the second period and scored the final goal in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, will weigh Milton Keynes on their field next Friday.
Air Traffic Control Killed Hundreds of Passengers on Plane to Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is remembered as a hero after he lost his life while allowing a plane carrying hundreds of people to safely get off the piste.
More than 800 people were killed in a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Violent rising shocks continue in the region, and many people in the city of Palu are still waiting to be rescued under destruction.
Although his colleagues fled to save their own lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, refused to leave his duty at the control tower in the earthquake-crazy Palu airport.
Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, stayed in the tower to make sure the flight number 6321 was flown safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower thinking that the traffic control tower had collapsed.
He lost his life in the hospital where he was later removed.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Sirait told ABC News Australia that the controller’s decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
"We have prepared a helicopter to transport our colleague to a larger hospital in another city than Balikpapan in Kalimantan."
“Unfortunately, we lost him before we got to Palu this morning.”
Sirait added, "We are very sad to receive this news."
On the other hand, the country's disaster-fighting agency noted that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited. Authorities are concerned that the death toll could rise to thousands.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the organization, said: “We think the death toll could increase because there are still so many people in the midst of destruction.”
Waves of up to six yards destroyed Palu, and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are taking medical help and the necessary supplies to the region.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings in new bodies.
Clean water is very difficult.
Mini-markets are not raining everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Indonesia’s President of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “We race in time to help the survivors as Indonesia’s Red Cross, but we don’t know what we’re going to face there.
It’s already a big tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, calling the army: “I want you to work night and day to complete all the duties related to the evacuation.
Are you ready to do that?”
Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people in Lombok earlier this year.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports that a man is missing after a plane crash on the lagoon.
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, said 47 passengers and crew were safely leaving the plane while only one person was missing.
The Air News reported that no male passenger was found as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to locate the passenger.
The airline has not yet answered any further questions about the passenger’s age or suitability.
Boats in the area helped rescue other passengers and crew on the crashed plane while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were under observation at the hospital and that their condition was stable.
The cause of the accident and how the events progressed respectively still preserves its uncertainty.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses claimed the plane was missing the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was approaching the runway very low.
Jaynes added, "This is an extremely good thing."
Jaynes said that he and the rest of the crew were able to make their way to the emergency exits of the plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and yelled and got a small wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to repair a nearby pier helped rescue operations using an inflatable boat for people to move to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 ft).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents at PNG-registered airlines over the past 20 years, but Air Niugini has no accident history.
Analyst revealed the flow of time the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor’s office presented evidence in a 2014 trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive on Saturday.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has been speaking for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The analyst told the jury how the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers combined their movements the night they died.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she received location information from her cell phones to show that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died.
The data went to Sanford to speak to the police when he showed his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers when he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford went to the courthouse on Saturday and said he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors recalled the statement that Tellis was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford continued to say, "The defendant is lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew him for about two weeks when Chambers died.
Cell phone records show that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "He wiped her out of his life."
The defendant is scheduled to begin the closing defenses on Sunday.
The judge said the case was expected to be handed over to the jury in the early hours of that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
This hip hop trio wants to change the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from the origins of political messages and has dealt with social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common, through artists such as Akala and Lowkey, have recently begun to become again popular in England.
Another black one?
A New Yorker nun is suing for a dual "racist" message she's working with
A New York-based nun sues her for being discriminated against and fired from her job after a message that the child's mother accidentally wrote and sent her "one more black."
He denies what he's done with double racism and makes the case look like "money laundering."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, said she was upset when she learned that the new childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black on her first day in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband, "There's a lot more."
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, after noticing the joke he made, fired African-American Ms. Maurice, saying that her taste was doing a bad job, and that she was expecting a Filipino grandmother.
Ms. Maurice was paid a daily fee and then sent home with an Uber car.
Maurice seeks compensation for his dismissal by suing the couple, demanding $350 a day for the six-month period he was hired without a contract and worked at home.
The woman who spoke to the Post on Friday said, "I want to show them that they can't do that."
Responding to claims that they are two racists, he states that it makes sense for Maurice to finish his job because he says they are afraid they won't trust him after he insults him.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post, “My wife sent her something she didn’t actually mean.
He's not a racist.
“We are not racist people,” he says.
"But even if you accidentally hand your children over to someone you've treated rudely?
Your newborn baby?
Don't do it."
Seeing the case as an "money-cutting" effort, Plasco adds that the baby was born just two months ago and that his wife was "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to sue someone like that?" he says.
"That's not very nice," adds the investment expert.
The legal process is still going on, but it’s being shot from the ground up on social media because of its dual behavior and logic in the public eye.
A new letter shows that Paddington publishers fear that readers won’t be able to relate to a talking moon
Shortly after Bond's book was accepted, his daughter, Karen Jankel, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads for the first time before it's published.
It’s so fun to see what we know now about Paddington’s great success.”
Jankel, who said that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book from the mouth of a small toy month, was optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, said the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his father died last year.
He described Paddington as a "very important member of our family" and said his father was quietly proud of the success he had achieved at the end of the book.
“My dad was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t proud of what he did,” he said.
“But since Paddington is so real to him, you feel like you have a kid who can do something, and you’re proud of it even if it’s not your success.
I think that's how my father assessed Paddington's success.
Although he was the product of his invention and his dream, he would always be entitled to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, his daughter, Louis Pasteur 2, was taken to Nice's Hospital, and the doctors tried to save the woman's life, but they were unsuccessful.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said, "Nad called me regularly and said it was really bad and she wasn't expected to live."
“Then I got a phone call from Nad saying that he would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to him.
And that's what I did.
"Tashi, I love you so much, honey," I said.
"We'll be together again soon."
I'll be with you.
The medications given by doctors to keep the heart pumping blood are slowly losing its effect and leaving the body.
He died a long time ago, and now it's all over.
I knew what was going to happen, and I just had to sit and wait.
I couldn’t scream because I was in a place where there were family members and a lot of people, I couldn’t scream and cry.
I really had to keep myself.”
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving her daughter, finally got on the plane with other passengers knowing of the difficulties she was going to experience.
"No one knew," he said.
“I shook my head and my eyes stopped tears.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad during the flight.
I felt she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved him.”
Women who lose their loved ones are sticking cards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide are trying to stop others from ending their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sticking cards on the Welsh Bridge for some time with inspiring messages and phone numbers for people who can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, began fighting depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” Davis says.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son is a smiling chef, promising the future and everyone around him.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They would say that his smile was a source of joy around him.”
But he quit his job because he was in a "very bad time" before his death.
The first person to notice that Tyler ended his life in 2014 was his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always worried that understatement will have an effect."
Mrs. Davis says the reason for making the cards is to "go and tell people that there are people you can always talk to, even if there is a friend."
"Don't be quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis's for years, lost her 15-year-old wife, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
“He never told me he was unhappy or depressed,” he said.
“We noticed a change in attitude a few days before Christmas.
Christmas Day was extremely bad, and when the kids opened the gift packs, they didn’t even make eye contact with them.”
He said his wife’s death was a major trauma for the entire family, but they had to overcome it: “There is a hole in the heart of the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's fate will be determined by the FBI's investigation.
Speaking on Saturday, "I think if an investigation had been carried out as limited in scope and time as he wanted, we could have reached an agreement," Mr Flake said that he feared the committee, which had entered into a dispute due to partisanship.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to do an investigation?
The reason for all these inconveniences is timing.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections, and if Republicans do a bad job as expected of them on November 6, efforts to ensure that the person they want is elected to the country’s highest court will be seriously damaged.
George W. Bush had been lobbying for support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who had been working for him in the White House for some time, and who had made it possible for him to meet his current wife, Ashley.
What happens after the FBI prepares the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach 50 votes in the Senate right now, and if he can, Vice President Mike Pence can turn himself up to the Supreme Court by breaking the partnership.
The number of people who fled North Korea under Kim's administration has "decreased"
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has declined after Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, who pointed to information from the South’s unification ministry, said the number of refugees in 2011 had dropped to 1,127 last year.
Mr Park said tightened border controls between North Korea and China and that human smugglers are the most important factors demanding higher fees.
Pyongyang did not make any statement.
The vast majority of refugees fleeing from the North are offered the opportunity of South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreas have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of these people are fleeing the country through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is more easily able to cross from the seriously protected Disarmed Zone (SB) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees from the country as very illegal immigrants from the refugee and mostly returns them to their countries.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have been greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the pending nuclear disarmament.
The meeting came after U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un agreed to work on a nuclear-cleared Korean peninsula in June.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the U.S. for not showing enough progress on sanctions since then.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Ri said, “If we don’t trust the United States, we can’t risk our national security, and under these conditions we can’t be the first to make a unilateral disarmament.”
Nancy Pelosi said Brett Kavanaugh was "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the High Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she was “hysterical” for High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and said she was nervously unsuitable to serve in the High Court.
Pelosi made this statement Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Speaking to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Kavanaugh said: “If a woman did the same thing, I can’t ignore the fact that people would say ‘hysterical.’”
Kavanaugh rejected Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault as a teenager.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was quite emotional, and when talking about his family and high school years, he almost screamed from time to time and sometimes couldn’t speak.
He also explicitly cursed the Democrats on the committee, describing her accusations as a “disgusting and planned character assault” organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's statement was proof that he could not serve in the High Court because that statement showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he shows his own inadequacy with these statements and his attitude towards Democrats and Clinton,” he said.
Kavanaugh was elected and the Democrats hesitated to answer Pelosi, who asked him whether he would appeal to the Supreme Court if he provided a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this; if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, serving in the Supreme Court isn’t even fit to be in the court he’s currently in,” he said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that he was concerned that Kavanaugh was a Democrat because he was seen as a conservative judge over potential rulings against the Economic Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade.
In acceptance trials, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether or not to change certain Supreme Court rulings.
Pelosi said: "Histerik, a prejudiced person should not expect us to go to court and say, 'Isn't this great?'"
And women have to use it.
True criticism, even the anger of months and years, can’t express it without crying.
45 years later, Ms. Steinem said to me, "We cry when you're angry."
"That's not very rare, is it?"
She went on to say, "A woman who was in charge of a place helped me a lot, and she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique and when she was angry and started to cry, you might think, 'I'm sorry I was crying with this technique.
I'm angry." he said.
And then it goes on.
I think that's very smart."
Partly because of its fundamental misunderstanding, tears appear as an outburst of anger.
I have a memory that I remember very well from one of my first jobs; I was crying in an office where men were mostly incredibly angry, an older woman, a cold manager I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me from the bench and dragged me into a staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
"They won't understand you're angry.
They’ll be happy to think you’re sad because they’ll know they can affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressman at the time, worked with her during Gary Hart's term as president.
When Mr. Hart was caught on a ship called Monkey Business in 1987 and pulled out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was extremely surprised, realized that there was no obstacle to her discovery of the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," he says, smiling at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and what they needed was another candidate.
"The Cotton Princess and the Seven Dwarfs," said one.
He was behind finding funds because he was late to his campaign and vowed not to enter the race until he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He noticed that some of his supporters who gave the men $1000 gave him only $250.
"Do they think I've been discounted?" he asked.
While making a speech he announced he would not launch an official campaign, he was filled with feelings of gratitude to the people who supported him, as much as frustration and anger caused by the system that made it so difficult to find money and target delegates.
"You thought I was going through a terrible crisis," said Ms. Schroeder, recalling the press's reaction to her.
“You thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember what I thought they would write to the graveyard.
“Would they cry?”
How can the U.S.-China trade war benefit Beijing?
The first shots of the trade war between the U.S. and China were very severe, and the openness between the countries could be useful for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by bringing in additional taxes on China’s most important exports of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most notable tension this week emerged from the introduction of additional customs duties on some goods worth a total of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) and, in other words, the taxation of half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has responded more politely each time, raising tariffs on US products worth $60 billion last time by up to five percent.
China has pledged to give the US the same power, and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will soon surrender.
Stepping back to Washington requires the demands to be met, but clearly submitting to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Yet experts say that if China plays its cards correctly, the two economies could be positively impacted in the long run by the pressures in the trade war with the United States by reducing their ties to each other.
Abigail Grace, a researcher at a think tank called the New American Security Center, said: “The fact that a rapid decision to be made in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could cause economic unrest in one of the two countries is clearer than the people who follow the developments.
The foreign minister said: "Return of Syrian refugees 'ready'"
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and wants help to rebuild the country, which has been destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, said the situation in the country was improving.
"Thanks to the fight against terrorism, the ground is now stronger and our land is safer," he said.
The government is continuing the rehabilitation process to return the areas destroyed by the terrorists to normal.
All conditions exist for the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods and for migrants to voluntarily return to their countries where they are forced to leave due to terrorism.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country due to the war that began in 2011.
Six million of the people who are still living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime was open to future aid to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he drew the gold that they would not accept future aid from the countries sponsored by the conditional aid and the insurgency.
The European Ryder Cup in Paris wins
The European Team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. Team at Le Golf National outside of France with 16.5 against 10.5.
With this defeat, the United States experienced its sixth top-top defeat in Europe, and has not won any Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reclaimed the European crown with 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, hit the water in the par-3 16th hole and gave the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of four players to progress 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-ranked player of the European team.
World's highest-ranked player Dustin Johnson won 2-1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who is likely to never be in the Ryder Cup again.
Sergio Garcia, who has competed in the Ryder Cup eight times, is Europe’s highest-ever winner with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but I can’t stand it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm very, very happy that I got the cup back.
It’s about this team and I’m very happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
Tiger Woods, a golf legend from the United States, is handed over to his niece, John Ram, who defeated him in Sunday’s 2&1 singles game.
"I'm incredibly proud of the Tiger Woods I grew up watching," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It’s a strange statistic for Jack Nicklaus, who came in first with 14 major championships and was one of the greatest players of all time.
Patrick Reed, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament, tried to find free pass for the entire U.S. team, with the exception of Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, throughout the weekend.
After a performance for the team that was disappointing, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we've been smashing Europe.
We fought.
I'm putting on a hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Each of the 12 players played very well.
We're going to reassemble the team, work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee in America, and we're going to keep moving forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captains.
You have to take off your hat.
They played better than us.”
