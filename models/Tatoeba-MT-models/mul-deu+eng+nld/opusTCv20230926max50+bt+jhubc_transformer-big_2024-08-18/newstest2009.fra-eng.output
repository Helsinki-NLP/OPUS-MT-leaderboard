At the end of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange bascula in the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, from the start of the exchanges, the Prague stock market resumed with its fall the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The market's reaction to the result of the US House of Representatives' vote, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilization plan, is thus also noticeable here.
Fall of stocks in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although the indices managed to erase some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trades, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“The hesitancy about rescue action in the US will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should soon resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The Bloodbath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion K<0xC4><0x8D>).
Lawmakers thus rejected the call for support of President George Bush’s bill.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday and the main stock indices saw the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a drop of such magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress cedes: U.S. government may inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the U.S. financial aid agreement.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turn in talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion financial aid (about 12 trillion crowns) granted to the U.S. financial system.
The success is not so sure.
Indeed, before Congress can publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, the chairman of the House’s banking and financial regulation committee, told Reuters.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor to revive financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, there will be a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the shape the package of measures should have for market stabilization,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give the bottom of the government a final shape.
It should buy out, from financial companies, the unsoldable real estate assets that cause financial companies significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that are falling.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are making sure that Congress comes to a definitive agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect Monday’s trade.
But for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will vote, or whether the negotiations will not be blocked at the last minute by one or another problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be made available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option of blocking the granting of the remaining amount by following two steps: first $100 billion extra, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations.
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress, he has the opportunity to put it in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining funding for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to vote on the bill, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President George W. Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated “the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of Golden Parachute
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the settlement agreement, and the timeline plan.
The new law also provides for limiting the said gold parachute for directors of the companies participating in the program and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides for aid for property owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is because we don't know what the mechanism and the price of the purchase of problematic assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is not as important as that, according to Marek.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and that they will consecrate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, foreseeing the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek said.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While virtually all mobile phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent that there are sufficient reasons to acquire an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are vinyl records in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you’re at least probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music on the move, that is, of compressed music, to put it simply - of music in MP3.
There, too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time bearing headphones purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
There are two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown features, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, phone calls and sending SMS, it is able to read music and movies, to record the latter, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you’ll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no TV will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal nature of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the lower the interval between two recharges.
And playing music is one of the most important energy buckets.
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) are significantly more performant.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, expect them to play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this is true even for more expensive devices.
There will be no problem for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of a recharge, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording the music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
One can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card players know how to do it without a reduction, given the small dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As for the drives, you don’t need, except for the iPod, any software.
Just fill up, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers will create their own media library, sorted by the performer's name, album title, style, or by the user's judgment.
Some devices display only one index with a tree structure, in the way of Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a concrete device, you are especially interested in the life of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of output of the sound and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile playing the MP3s.
Virtually all mobile phones are capable of doing so today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the player is able to play.
Everyone gets to read the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will get to you will have just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also get to play music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
All you need to do is visit the corresponding operator (or another provider) web pages from your mobile phone and purchase the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to purchase a music mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is, in most cases, limited to radio tubes made quickly.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, the Internet, or even the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their phones on themselves.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the phone out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones on you or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobile phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand crowns, one can already have a very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for regular headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also provided with an entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Indeed, anyone who manages to control the most rudimentary drives - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command to that of a cassette record, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get away with even 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, buy a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iris.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman phones (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and so the ease of the control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the most far in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Might be.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz many times that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's latest steps in the area of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of the Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no more room for another operator, choruses with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network apparently no longer has much luck (by the way, now he would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which the conventional operators were subsequently to respond as well.
Yet, even before the entry of party-disturbances such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those that are heard today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We don’t have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
In addition, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among other things.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be efficient, they do indeed need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
Now, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good ad.
In fact, this operator specifically targets men.
“The real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work in our home as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project to success, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promotional.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
Instead, they try to do their best to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not been hiding, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner will be the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not consider that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific in comparison with others.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet recorded a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
“It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate within such a limited time frame, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs its attention to fulfilling requests for its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our opinion, means the most contributions from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to discover a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
What good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to understand each other as larrons at the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when creating the U:fon, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the web pages of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
Now, today, the U:phone is ready to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> remarked: “Competition in the mobile market has recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators as follows, the indifference of the Czech regulators seems confusing.
However, this is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, because the offer of potential stakeholders a priori has not shown sufficient interest for the classical operators," said Kristian Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
A statement made in this way would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, such a statement is more than misleading.
Especially since Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Overseas, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile phone services."
However, putting pressure on the fair functioning of the market and the price drop does not appear to be in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concordance of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all gas stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of competition.
“The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their market behaviour.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator,” Chaloupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitutes, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator logically enough has the monopoly on its network.
This is why it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they are facing similar constraints in the negotiations with all operators.
Putting the responsibility back on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common thread in communications, through which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted telecoms law has failed to bring about an extension of the powers of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This, the representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one is watching, it can work.
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a matter of companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Personalized mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected officials.
The magic round is that the business done in front of the operator is a classic business client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are talking about happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and that could result in a termination of cooperation with the company in question," said Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the managers of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible profits, and at the same time, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is precisely what should seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question is posed to <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would occur, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a significant drop in the price of services.
However, in virtually every country where virtual operators appeared, the classical operators were trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulators intervened in developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the same way as a hot potato that is disposed of by transmitting it to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in skills is more than beneficial to them in these cases.
But let's not throw the cuff after the knee.
If behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will appear soon, the Czech mobile market may be on the move.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will be unable to remain impassioned in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is insured by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremia<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the anthem arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national anthem as one of the most beautiful anthems.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rözhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that we could understand the lyrics, that they were singing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j resounds for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse des salvetiers), original Czech play by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the “new” hymn sound?
Prague’s public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be included in the history of the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day voucher (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Transport Agency, located at the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Andrarov<0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovi.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons online on the web pages of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service in the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget the counters in the subway stations, where so far they had to pawn impatience in long tails in order to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and will register it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stsk<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a ticket office with trained staff at the disposal of passengers, which will help those interested in buying over the internet and also record the coupon they have purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the machines to compost the tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
An ATM will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will operate from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
In the suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xA1> integrovan<0xC3><0xA1> doprava (integrated transport from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the joint transport control Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the Prait des Horpid organization.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated in the driver’s cab.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not take the city buses and will not remember the expiry date of their voucher can rejoin the ATMs, initially used to register the vouchers on the card.
This is where, on the screen of the device, information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudetens demanded a referendum in the United States
The Sudeten Germans demanded that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States in 1945.
This is the result of a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> vededek<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemia).
If we can’t be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This results, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> vedeck<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna.
<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov's Germans prayed in the letter that the US president would not allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavsk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter read, signed "People, to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava is at heart."
Given that the rally in Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, unquestioning attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter now always ask the US President to take in his hands the protectorate.
“We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed in no way to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants,” the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetenland of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to realize that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them agreed to such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would gain some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they got home, the Czech would be beneficial to them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, according to the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An Emotional Campaign Will Attack Drivers
The most expensive road safety action in the history of the Czech Republic.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek's office believes it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that are going to attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the "blooding" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is inscribed in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a bottle of blood, there is the phrase "You will pay."
This must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "handle" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can commonly see images with drastic images of the victims of the accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whipping system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers," said Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
The warning signs to drivers are already less effective, he said.
“When a static warning panel is installed, it will likely merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, spoke in favour of the return of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories,” Olmert told the daily.
“We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be made,” he added.
He admitted that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he later said.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan Heights retreat," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to relinquish their current relations with Iran; they will have to relinquish their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to relinquish the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (the Shia movement), the Islamic State's prime minister, the al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and its D.
Questions that arise after the accident: Stewards in the car because they are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden.
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If one wants to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said Transport Ministry spokesperson Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road from the bus.
The girl was sadly sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus may have an accident, or even slow down abruptly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its technical file equipped with standing seats or not.
If this stand-up equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats, which was confirmed at Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the company director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is an issue that we have discussed with the department and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got the passengers to go to the toilet during the ride provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the stewards.
“There is no unequivocal legal interpretation of the role of steward – no legal prescription deals with that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," Hanzelka added with more ambiguity.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the traffic department for road vehicles, believes that the law addresses the problem sufficiently.
"It all depends on whether the coach has the permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
It's all in there," he said.
Buses are divided into urban ones, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, intercity ones with standing seats and a higher permissible speed and long-distance buses without standing seats with the highest permissible maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on a plane, an expert said.
Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n, expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in airplanes.
There, too, it is not certain when a turbulence will occur and the air hostess can sneeze her head."
"Now, in case the bus would have braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal regulations," he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier offering stewards services.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their trade to be a risky trade.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that it is a risky profession, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses, we've been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, in T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
An immense tragedy has happened.
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency strip without using a blinker and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he frowned on his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refused to sell the two seats reserved for the stewards’ rest.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but in terms of financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been in the process of being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Department of Transportation, could provide clarification on the movements of stewards on board the bus.
"Now, it has not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the laptop at the wheel," says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Department of Transportation does not consider the activity of stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Occupational Safety Office.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not missing in the letter sent by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
From a union of the entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be formed, according to the letter made public on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled by a sustainable productivity in such a case.
In short, such a relationship could be the decisive trigger for other concentrations in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a Steering Committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is always under a lot of pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Supervisory Authority for Financial Services that has only recently made it clear to the Government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now there has been a question - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of any kind between the bank Deka, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Indeed, Deta-Bank chief Franz Waas made it known at the presentation of the figures from the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a Land bank, whether the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and the savings banks groups, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with the WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial space.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees counts as one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, has come into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate and the Halbab.
However, nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the Government of the Land of Hesse was against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Later, the other two houses did not join either.
The Bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate was attached instead to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new deals on the reunification of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, chairman of Hellaba’s board of directors, had spoken out against any commercial strategy of merger with his bank.
Notwithstanding this, there seems to be a widespread feeling that the reunification of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Land Bank of Baden-Württemberg could come to fruition first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers should increase, the potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although so far she has resisted the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
On the other hand, the Hesse-Turkey savings and transfer group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain in rigour.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely the business model by which the future capacity of the Landesbanks should be ensured, had not been resolved by the German group of savings and transfer funds.
In the long run, a detachment of the WestLb could take place, detachment which is obviously not desirable here.
This is also what is being discussed in the letter of the existing Steering Committee: in any case, a 'global solution' would be aimed at the establishment.
How this will all be put into the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a ton of five liters of beer from the Kaiser brand, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 beer festival visitors what deep sounds its goose can produce.
Elena tapes Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta Nueva station, four buses depart tonight at 23:45, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively from Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, Marco Guarda explains, it is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For five years, they have been going to the beer festival, already three turns only this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a head of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses are driving at night on the Autostrada towards <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian registration plates take a break again just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at 6:30 a.m. on the parking lot near Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, get your hair done with the little yellow cap.
Above it is written on the left <0x60>F<0xC3><0xAA>te de la beer', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conosciviaggiando.it".
Secondly: 'When the doors of the beer hall open, we run,' Marco shouts in the early morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
“Don’t go ahead, otherwise you block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!”
The chope, Marco shouts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the slogan!
<0x60>Show the security officers that we are doing well!
As soon as you leave your places, they are gone!”
Third: ‘Tonight, to be back here at ten and a half hours!’ Do you understand?
And that's it, it's off to the beer party.
On the way, someone tied yellow caps to the trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the ‘Italian Weekend’.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set out across the Alps and collapsed in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean policemen, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which produces statistics on countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the brewery Hofbräu.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word <0x60>relatively' and that it glided that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This is what happened this weekend.
Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), sided with the DAX, gets a one-billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect themselves from market turbulence.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are being issued up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public-law banks.
In the background, it is the Deppa subsidiary that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money — which has been no longer possible since the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.37 million, while the equity rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current earnings and net earnings from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, down to zero, earnings from the assignment of determined receivables and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen from 5 million to more than 70 percent.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Deffa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies of the Group that the deficit of profits be modrée is about 16 percent.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state-owned financier had initially misspeculated on real estate industrial credits, which had then been affiliated with Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state funding was not profitable enough, Deffa had subsequently become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint ventures between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have on the calculation of the Group’s gains and losses a material effect that still remains rather blurred.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been cut to two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor since the acquisition of Deffa.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions in the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again drastically increased, with banks accumulating their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a portion - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion - of all Deffa credits of a short-term refinancing medium.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered with medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of the largely out of business international financial markets currently.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE’s Chairman Georg Funke, however, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institution (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group in the market is now ensured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors have nothing more to hope for.
However, given the dynamics and impenetrability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest announcements, still at the gates of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue at least provisional will not be able to reassure the minds either.
The price of the stock fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While debt to the first boss has barely moved, the rates of second-rate loans are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and of course those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Hypo Real Estate bank previously seemed to be an alternative investment of speculation, but their value must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the institution by the de-racha.
As long as the less-affected issuing institutions, governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the gaps will resorpt over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope for right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached security has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should set aside insomnia nights primarily for long-term creditors on the decision whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they drew a trait on to constitute a loss deferral for the next few years on the next capital income tax from the automatically deducted stock gains.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: the German is so "kawaii"!
What do you mean, what do you mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
I'm so excited about it.
The way to go to school already scared me.
I live in the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way all by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after another from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I don’t like to talk in front of people at all, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I presented myself before the pupitre, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low masses, laughed and made signs, and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew him through my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese teens and means "sweet, chubby".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a great ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who better, smiling and asking me a lot of questions – in this case, it’s quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the miserable German cassettes.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and algae salad, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything's really good.
Well, except maybe the salt plums canned, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I’m curious if I could see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always said then:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
After all, reading manga’s is what I’ve preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that lies there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
A rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he experiences the same thing when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to have proof of it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, one can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter hardly practicable terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least, therefore, for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity might reside in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being linked to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internally and subjectively, is neither measured nor analyzed by this particular Hardware, based on our own experience, then its observation poses major problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is next to it another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and this is exactly what happened when studying the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also underlines the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does it mean for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, such as the reactions of the body) captures living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others other than ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the body sensation regions of the cortex and the brain stem, just like Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could be quite involved in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how, however, could one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees in the face of danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain stems, while cockroaches don’t even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the cause of the sensations?
And even if we could prove it for humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations probably differ completely from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is on the nerve plane insofar as the same is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
We could think of this as short-term, but I'd rather move forward than knock myself constantly against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotionalist.
Platini, UEFA president: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigory Surkis.
"Uefa is constantly on the lookout for us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said.
"We have assured in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several Premier League members have been convicted, already in the previous season, for manipulation of mandatory relegation; in the end, the start of the League has even been postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid angry at counter-attack
She wanted to do promotion for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her former adulteryr Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attack.
A Late Rose War for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors embark on a gruesome battle—to everyone’s mind and heart.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to his qualification as an infidel husband fell clear: it would be “Monsterious,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News, “that Meg is once again wiping out the story of our relationship and manipulating it.”
It would be more "unfortunate" that "the punishment and upheaval of a divorce for each child will be revived in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the clapping: "In any case, my life goes on.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, showed a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, hotel nights have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by another 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was sharp, especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reasons for all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a “declining travel drive of American tourists.”
Financial venues such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was on the rise in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, business-class and first-class, however, price fluctuations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even split by two according to this study.
On the one hand, the reasons for this fall in prices would be weakening economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would cede ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the "Open Sky" treaty that liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the strained situation is the removal by airlines of non-profit trips, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines only in Europe.
HSV Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find a functional 11.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not return until late in the game and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He simply knew that he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn’t much going on in the dressing rooms, half the time was over and most had settled in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol grabbed and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
Implementation has failed.
"It wasn't all very nice to see today," said Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard would have “wanted to be more relaxed as well.”
This 1:0 (1:0 in the half), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful header by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a dirty victory," Marin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
As early as Saturday afternoon, fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to take a step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the First League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as the detached Jansen of FC Bayern - is certainly forming gently, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
In Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in all history.
Later on, the Dow Jones recovered a bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index stood at 10,579 points with a drop of as much as five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The biggest losers in the Dow Jones were American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs reported a decline of almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the bailout plan, funds must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage securities.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in relation to the price trend in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.

All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s $700 billion heavy bailout plan could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first opening hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has been down 3.2 percent for the time being, while the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 percent.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational-support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to frozen fuel pipelines soon, death is a cryogenic threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, just like the Ulysses solar probe.
That’s what’s been surprising to researchers for years: flying objects don’t always behave 100 percent the way you expect them to be according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes as hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting prior to the release, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media in concert.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts, are well behaved and safe, Egyptian national television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to ending the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security official, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without yelling at the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the agent said.
All that remained was to gather the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot down six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be returned by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men had to be held back until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the story.
Abuse of a father-in-law that leads to suicide
A court has been informed that years of abuse inflicted by his father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, in Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight indictments for indecent acts.
Truro's grand trial court said he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a National Trust volunteer, was haunted by abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told her that Ms Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006, and had "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
They think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s beautiful father, who had written a confession letter that ended with: “I tied her up and bandaged her regularly.”
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been definitely terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the suicide of the victim.
And what’s even more amazing is that if she hadn’t done that, her story would certainly never end in court.”
He added: "I particularly emphasize, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
“Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.”
Sentencing for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office’s ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The Department of Defense man was on the move when he forgot two high-ranking documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
“They would have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Department of Defense and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause that deals with the retention of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies in front of the B&B bill.
The UK building companies may have to pay an invoice of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the bailout of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys’ 2.6 million savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from savers, including 59 companies from the building.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” to know that companies and their members would have to pay for the broken pots.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But interest that will increase at the same time will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... must now pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediaries must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to settle interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Trade Committee for Building Companies, told the BBC that the decision was unfair.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks to assess the options to be taken to avoid building companies and their members paying this salaried bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could double.
As building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five pence per litre
The people of Jersey have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it would raise the wholesale price of its milk, by five pence per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of a search conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide whether to go in turn, raising the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had last varied, in 2002.
Ex-Pm from Bangladesh has been denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is likely to be arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her review for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was relaxed on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s interim military government first give him his full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request saying she did not require bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the military interim government took power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, denies the accusations they make.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations launched a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she has not been able to contact children from the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A U.N. spokesperson said it happened despite the Taliban’s promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB Loses ITV 's Judicial Battle
BSkyB lost its trial following a ruling by the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that in the past, MSkyB’s participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase of ITV's shares by BSkyB had cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, thus inciting the Competition Commission to investigate the
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group, and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All of this stemmed from the report of the Department of Justice Inspector General's case, which criticized the actions of certain departmental officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Danney, will now investigate whether the officers interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
“Serious allegations of potentially unfounded criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the dismissal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were fired because of poor performance.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more critical than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to give these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader," remarkably succeeding not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, have been critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will be honoured.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, is to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive this recognition.
The nine-minute-and-fifty-second song was the title of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The awards night is presented by Coldplay, with this year a limited selection to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely leaving.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English charts, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal his heartbeat that became irregular after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in the vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time locals don't know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide to 120 feet long, it resembles a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaint Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, said they were fascinated by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets on the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that runs the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of committees of neighborhood owners, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
“There are only a few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place,” she said.
"They could propose to re-establish and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a coffee shop to which the manufacturer will grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokeswoman, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, that doesn't necessarily mean she wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relook this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, further stressing that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's large farmhouse was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The subsequent entrance to the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards East Village luxury, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be put in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Nostalgic Regard to a City in the Extinction Process") recounts the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow, dark ass of day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and shutters, full of last week's newspapers flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs agilely at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a 22-ounce bottle of empty beer, rests alongside newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by have stated that they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he thought that some of the subs considered the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have taken place in dark, humid and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California member of studies, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Thought. Why Middle Classes Should Be Able to Choose Their School."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign stresses that “African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program supports, among so many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to pursue a bilingual education that advocates teaching in a class of languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of students, made up of many newcomers, are studying English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 Mathematics State Examination, expert level.
Similarly, nearly 93% of students have passed the English-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street focuses on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama might copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has instituted English language instruction "full immersion".
Full immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without her class, you wouldn't have had any chance of identifying her."
“It works,” she observes, “it worked for us.”
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure Obama’s prognosis of the M. response.
Although it is favorable to the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
On the contrary, he stated, “you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully, the models of education that work, rather than defaming them or considering them as insignificant.
Net Oil Drop Following the New Concerns of the World Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the bailout plan for financial marches will fail to bring the economy back to life.
Oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel, the New York Mercantile Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, the commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After seeing a rise of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, before bounced back to the deep uncertainty of the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the agreement on the bailout plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s hectic negotiations with the bailout deal “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchanges has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally, and in particular, in China.”
Analysts of the bank reduced their expectations for next year, given the decline in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease by 20 per cent, the forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Feast of the Determinant Second Time for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned 0 to 0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second season began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played salty under dark clouds.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, a sign of an afternoon in which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from half time.
"I didn't leave my zone," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a mediocre player"
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense beat the Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith took another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
In the last change, Bowens's ball loss could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking an edge of 34 to 0.
It was the best the Jets could score in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second time or the third time?"
When he was told the two- the Jets left 21 undisputed points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best backrunner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie broke his record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600m of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing—may be exaggerated in the eyes of today—that air pollution does not increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees on departure, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into runners, have contributed to the marathon record dropping by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered from cramps two weeks earlier, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that rest allowed him to remain shiny, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today, I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better."
He was accused—especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia—of having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world marathon stars, actually counting on the rabbits as if they were in a track competition, and considering more the world record than the sense of comété.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's capabilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the queue heads disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to detach from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the Beijing Games due to a back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her personal record of almost five minutes at her third marathon.
She ran using a skillful strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, shiny and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, first entirely black town to integrate, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make these days." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, and two schools caught.
It has now become a pilgrimage town.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes has become a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is as independent, worthy, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston recounted that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knows us so little, doesn't know what he's missing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious from a foreign perspective.
"We are very cautious about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident of the town and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It has to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of a southern black rural culture—sometimes despised, sometimes acclaimed—reminiscent of the birth of American slavery.
That would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere, dialectic books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses the often forgotten center of Florida, ending in chapters of black history and human drama.
Bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the proprietary store of Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
“You’ll find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, even though he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks as well as anything that can serve passers-by.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson’s young girls who Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
We still remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without notifying, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, one is proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But furthermore, he adds, swinging himself in his back patio chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly named, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world,” said Valérie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to pass a five-lane highway in the city, to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's main two-lane street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mix of races led to hatred at the doors of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white youths were throwing oranges or objects at people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They threw a waterfall out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville’s cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
“Black children used to be kissed—I remember right—they kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening, too,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief of the Eatonville Community Rescue, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white — I mean there’s a line of cultural demarcation here,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, by the way, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston – black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as she, armed with joyful self-confidence and company lines of conduct such as: “How can they deprive themselves of my pleasure!”
That's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to American canons.
The highway project came just at the time when Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival’s inauguration two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal of the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed it up by stating that "Zora saved Eatonville".
Victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Nonresidents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono theme library (of course known as Hurston) opened in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repainted.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can be considered at any time as a back street posterior during a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(We now have 90 percent blacks.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things — like the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields — should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Miss Jones, a brave teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, clumsy, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
The voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need extra forces, is a source of genuine civic affection.
And even for the younger, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the description Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, who pass through this area there, will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Sunday’s Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
After all, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York, spend the worst “workday at the office” since the 1929 crack.
Carriers continue to crawl on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for material meetings.
The Latinos are still dragging among the residential buildings wearing, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hung on a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue up to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it’s still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Luckily, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I would find out at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people in the queue.
Not in front of the cash registers, or cash withdrawals or payment, but in front of the customer service desk, where regular customers ordered their checkers, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all queuing for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers as their family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks went bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327-capital bank, has resorted to the bankruptcy syndicate, and while New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend this evening, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its lean CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had for criticizing a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take risks.”
Muslim graves profaned as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "cities against Islamisation" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They wear road signs illustrating red-stretched mosques.
The police accuses far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery at the end of the week of the victory of far-right political parties in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; according to police, this is an organized action.
The delinquents painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise extremists’ hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be in some way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said it was “deeply shocked” at the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that comes to an end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage, following its right-wing swing in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, ran an anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against wearing scarfs and burkas, and even voiced his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, as demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference because they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
Courts have banned glamour rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he told the authorities under his control of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent granted the travel ban last Thursday after proving to magistrates Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Court of Limited Jurisdiction hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
On Thursday, September 25, in Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present then."
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be recorded in the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
It must inform the authorities if it wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his moves to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss special cases or potential Glitter's movements in the county.
A Kent Police spokesperson said: “The Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more efficient way.
“Protecting Kent residents is the Kent Police’s most expensive intention, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board for a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from checking passports, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and so he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, was going to the court of limited jurisdiction in Uxbridge, West London, for him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been given a four-month sentence in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from travel in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character." - Günther Bauer
No heels, no underwear.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers with intimate gestures and stolen glances of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not on typical images.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you do not need to take photos on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars.”
With the festival "Popular Mining Song", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and hardware, recall the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about the dance or the singing itself, but about the personality and character of the artist that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and the magic has been the constant of this work that we present these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people's portraits, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less.
I believe that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don’t know or that leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I’m still trying to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the Galerie El Fotomata, located at 20 rue de la Mata (street parallel to the People's Square of Hercules), which will be open until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "very bold"
The novel takes place in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that has as main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and who has passed through the country.
The Nobel Prize laureate confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that it should not write it".
“If I were reasonable, I wouldn’t do it, but I will do it and hopefully finish it,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists march through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award in the majority of the voices of the participants, made room full at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, has found himself in front of a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to experience new.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," emphasized Vargas Llosa, who said to the lesser to their "seems to go" and said that it "does not have any effect" and "reveren.
The bad weather ruins the Pozoblanco fair
The festival of flags that ended the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horseback riding toreadors checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather got tough on this fair, as at last two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday, it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az y Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's party takes place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after making hand movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
In the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the bull’s back and a cut ear that the discovered steps applauded more than his fight with the bull itself.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without punishment or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter undertake the escape.
Its load, more than two tons of hachisch, of what to stop them.
The police pursued and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Basque Government’s Department of the Interior.
The arrested person has been accused of drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated, and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the road, where the two occupants went down to escape into a wooded area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch ballots, then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "fake" since it did not coincide with that written on the grey card of the van, which is why they also charged the inmate with a forgery of documents.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old inmate, A.A.J., was put on custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the television series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her doing strange maneuvers as she tried to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California police patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "put a lot of pressure on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking backwards several times, she was riding on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents drove her to the drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "according to police officers' observation at first glance, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7:00 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous depression.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general and member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from the family last week after being accused of realizing his treatment.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take on its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the political party's behaviour that it will have to adopt within the Seville municipal council.
However, the leader of the United Left called for the investigations to show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business for maximum transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has “very strict codes of ethics for all civil servants.”
"Blood of Mayo", Garci's daring bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
The filmmaker tried to "stage the many characters and illustrate social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the top of the long list of actors.
The two-and-a-half-hour film, Blood of May, will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ literature, José Luis Garci claims to have made with this film "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to make a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the history of 2 May in Madrid.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decors and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that has deceived itself as a leader in the fight, since the struggle for independence signaled the people to VI-Il-de-Rebellions.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he was unable to shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel.
The filmmaker of "Back to Start" influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the filming and to whom he does not cast, since it informs him that he is "shameful" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker to be of the filmmaker."
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times nominated for the Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de mayo" "Seven tables de billiard fran<0xC3><0xA7>ais" and finally the winner, "Connét con'u<0xC3><0xAA>t", mi'ilné d'surnisols blinds", are not representative of this youth.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and now you just make one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n gets into the skin of the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillen dancer will pay tribute to an equally Sevillen dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three she will live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and an oriental dancer.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "butterfly dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me.”
The staging was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussions of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola, and the collaboration of a composer, Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, in the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and appreciates her work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, was part of the activities organized by the "Journal of a newly married Poet" (Juan<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cultura) and the "L'Andalousie" (L'Andalou).
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: This International populist of light" that was inaugurated in the last month of May.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best known Andalusian poets.
America would be better off without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was part of it.”
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Evil", and illustrates well the desperation of American cinema, and of all of America, facing the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
It was hard to get an Oscar.
He hasn't been filming since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard hit for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels exceeds all expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of its existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the esteem of Americans has fallen far, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it remains to human beings only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for anti-drug warfare created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that had difficulty imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He put the bar high,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to punch the screen like Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though he did not lack opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In the sky, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he has never been as proud as a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a philanthropist,” he says.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could be realized in 2016.
I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes made during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination note.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the very beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the dossards, which forces you to go ahead.
That’s not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
No, no, no.
They made you go there only to take the backpack (first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the 'S' size for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small sized jerseys with less fabric and at the same time cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which there were rebellions and raids on the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I think, didn't make the right start.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I believe that we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT's Conference on Emerging Technologies Microsoft presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks in this conversation, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to the camp).
Through a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this “receptionist” can know how many people there are in the place, who they are – including remembering which positions they occupy – and listening and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks her if she is here to visit someone and she tells her that she will answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has continued to add features and "extras" to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first approach to competing on Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for the computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your stepmother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the “death” of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
You turn your computer on only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time surfing the Internet than browsing windows.
What is half of the applications that come with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, busy months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I'll show you an example.
The photo in this article, was taken earlier this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week, a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But since the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was endosing it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Panor' and is part of the holding of the Association of Muscle Gays.
And if we begin to enumerate all his appearances, we could also mention this costaud moustachus who was lifting weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple cotton, moulded, sleeveless men's body jersey.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out from all the others.
First, by his flamboyant name - although known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel ' stands out from the others by its excellent cotton, unisex cut, distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the best-known body jerseys have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand not only produces tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and timid.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera's dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day, but at the same time exciting, awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are inspired a lot for our collections.
I like to stroll around town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you’re a very versatile woman, aren’t you?
I believe so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you dodge clothes, that’s when you really put yourself in the character’s skin.
So everything is connected.
You didn’t have it 30 years ago: Was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I’ve done all the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you'll be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body asks me to and, moreover, I want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you made last year to come out.
That's right, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I'm looking forward to the release of the films 'Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
See what you think of it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go up the bridge to make a model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to take part in a charity parade in London for her association in favor of supporting women and the clothes we were exhibiting - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were re-sold at auction.
The people that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
The good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to walk for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do it, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Driving alcohol recidivists will have to install the ‘alcolock’ system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of intoxication, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced in June last year and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a one-year pilot project.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering him/her road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety as well as the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers stopped for driving more than once in a drunken state, resume the car.
The alcohol lock would avoid this since it is a connected system on the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the one allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the expense of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain, it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This measure only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, nevertheless, reform done by criminal means requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one for experimental purposes.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential Hangar of the Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset, but its rays still forced him to put his hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Ah, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
Several of them are waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military line of 27 naval soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before going to the room where the official courthouse is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the city’s four largest hotels, a funny Mexican television journalist is waiting for them.
The Most Prestigious Price of Fashion
There is certainly no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is certainly no designer living more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her models in the Mango showcase at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and she was almost crying with emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface area.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown on the heart and doing against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a garment of Mango and a few hairs of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arms on it, arms swayed under her arms with her son Luis – Valpa<0xC3><0xB1>o - his tall man of almost two.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a vest because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself in the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner was metamorphosed by wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night tour of the opera she folded one, she made the 'good time' and ripped her 'good times', they ripped out of the room, they showed us some of the room.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another handsome man on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets and towels and having asked in advance, that there be no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The wake-up call almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse when we think about the agitated pace that current life imposes on us.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get peace of mind in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I’m not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk while they sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called sleepiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime numbness (pissing in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful or over-excited situations.
This is an unstudied phenomenon, anyway.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers, or vice versa with screams, tears, long speeches...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to bed.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the somniloquies appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because it's unconscious and you'd wake it up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he’s saying (which is not usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because in sleep he is not conscious in order to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illaeusers... at last
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of dissection.
Without making a great match, the Yellows and Blacks created the largest number of occasions and managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very supportive during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who was frowning on a shot from afar, Illhaeusern would take the ascendant slightly and turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn over it, Roman from the foot or Diebold came to chatter Danemari's defense.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we were just leaving Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to retake a rebound ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd).
But the Illhousians will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to reclaim the dressing rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his team-mates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Eleven Illhousian who just stepped back a bit to "compress" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big blunder, the ball was passing very close to the crossroads.
Sarkozy to meet the Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a trip through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of fishermen who severely disrupted the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the flight of gasoline prices, which reached a record at more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and salaries of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of nearly 10 km.
Quiberon's marina was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not stopped.
A filtering dam has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic and the Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the boatmen remained at the quay, or the Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important refinery Total de Donges.
The people of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the planned interview with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "do not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and engaged actor, Paul Newman, died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian airliner sits on 215 planes delivered this year despite the recession threats that are mounting on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the airliner delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to divest more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have relocated, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it has received, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, the paper cited sources close to the case.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to split include its subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, FT continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan that the Federal Reserve has granted to it at risk of US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders to a proper proportion.
Analysis Paris Historique de la séance Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic fall on Monday after the House rejected Paulson’s bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq technology-dominant index yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded 8.81% (or 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the start of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan, which was to allow for some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives refused to the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans have rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is indeed moribund ... then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to handle the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, “every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution” to the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, authorities organized the buyback of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632%, compared with 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 4.161%, compared with 4.357% the day before.
Obama wins points in first TV duel
In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House succeeded another to find out who, of John McCain or Barack Obama, took him away.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaigners proclaimed their own victory in this television duel, which was reportedly followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, although honorable, was not “brilliance” enough to allow him to thwart his decline in the presidential five-week polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published Saturday gives a five-point lead to Obama (49 percent vs. 44 percent to McCain), judges that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them gave the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead Thursday with the expected good performance of his collaborator, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She’s got good instincts,” Bill Clinton said this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain continued to highlight his undisputed foreign policy experience, while underscoring his opponent’s “na<0xC3><0xAF>vety” on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he has repeatedly accused.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he was representing the future.
Without dismantling, it proved concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand, while Obama, if,” he retorted, this weekend, a Democratic spot blaming the Republican for not taking all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the “America of the Street.”
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in the rain.
He didn't even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial bias clearly outlines Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of the precipice.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current debacle “is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still manage to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street booms, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the realization of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of a healthy system of renewable energies was his first priority.
McCain, meanwhile, wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates evaded questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "you noticed that there was an election, you?"
On Sunday evening, young people and opponents protested on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night as the polling stations in Minsk’s central square closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they didn’t even vote: “What good, because they’ll do what they want with my voice,” one young man says.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression on foreign observers with the aim of resuming language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered proper by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have been unable to participate in the draw," said Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” Alexander Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, said, “because what matters is what counts the votes, and in our country, it’s the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will be appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the vote to all manipulations.
“Did you notice that there was an election, you?” asks social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back on the square in October.
On television, President Lukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulated them on their success.
The Interview - Blood Resurrected
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the most safe and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public’s confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the grimness of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada instituted a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from recurring.
While Judge Krever was late to file his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was disheartening.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field over the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
From its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, Europe was witnessing the outbreak of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
We then relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, according to which when it is not known and that a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death.
In April 1999, the blood of persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was therefore refused.
However, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NATs) that make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have shortened the mute period, which spans between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors become infected without knowing it and that they cannot be detected.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years for a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product to occur.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain health," says the head of the management of Hema-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continued before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
“Requirements are increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets to be recharged.
The ageing population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which on average only includes 3% of Quebecers who are eligible for blood donation."
However, any healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is severe, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today’s life is so stressful, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago the bankrolling of our thousandth sample of cord blood, and it is expected to take more than a thousand samples per year.
We should start proposing for transplants at the beginning of next year,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," as Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - L'Impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the first division USL qualifying series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the series quarter-finals, to the finals of the series.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on one side as well as on the other, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other wickets of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first round of the series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the home game to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's Victorious Goal
The number one Canadian trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian in the dam shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec scored two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russians warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much of it in the first period,” Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest bet on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Québec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's partial election.
"To push the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the mainstream, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of image mill.
On three huge screens, there were spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Québec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources as in the election period.
In a press release, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth pane of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic area", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give deadlines, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's at home, it's in Québec.
Not only is it in our home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as well as to show that he was seeking a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the rush to gold in Abitibi, Québec engineering, the James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open all year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequista MP from Ungava), have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
Northern development would, moreover, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerned, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Plant in the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party has been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
In a press release, he invoked another conservative reference to this, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us here, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, arousing applause at their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, which the law allows.
He emphasized that his schedule was, however, fulfilled, notably by a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the Northern Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
The Pequista leader, Pauline Marois, outlined the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to implement it.
If he did, "we would be more advanced today" Ms. Marois commented alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutiny that takes place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
ADQ said it supports the government’s adoption of a Northern Plan.
“But what we want is that it’s not just a show,” commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from a holiday today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (Irony) at Harper's office, who last summer allowed Louise Arbour to say that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast reproach upon this woman who has waged an incessant struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says so much about the Prime Minister's environment as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national imprisoned in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the events that are blamed on him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves an inhuman child soldier.
The only one who turns to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among other things, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of torture.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", that word that Harper is constantly branding and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality anymore: one can harass, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a minority government leader so far (so what will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government gave up what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Le discourse orwellien de Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
Prosecuting an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small undisclosed publishing house with the aim of launching a “transparent public debate”.
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions in defamation, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defenders in order to impose a friendly settlement that will blush the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to look back on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada usually take place through the exchange of ideas and not through the exchange of ideas.
So it was enough for the mine to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust the public and rejects petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada from the back of the hand.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public debate" at the same time while disrespecting the opinions of that same public?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to fat-paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does so primarily because he rejects the brutal manner of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a whistle-blower (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has, moreover, filed a statement of intent in place of Black Canada's authors.
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s prosecution is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in block, the right to citation of credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that dislike the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under repetition, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the academic world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place arrangements to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It includes: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of committed public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done in such a way as to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“That’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, the chaos and the disruptions on Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline we agreed on was the opening of the markets this morning.
Late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has been credited with adding some provisions to the deal, including the one to allow owners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of business leaders rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on the US television broadcasts.
Asked about another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, Republican opponent John McCain responded, “I’d like to see the details, but I hope so.”
“The big lines I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back dubious, risky, and unsold claims from U.S. financial institutions with taxpayers’ money.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the collapse of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprimes) before expanding to other more widespread forms of financing and banning credit securities (PCAA) and institutions on a freeze-out.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had led the first draft of the deal last week.
It is believed to have come out of this impasse since the Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the corner for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it regain its placement.
The new plan envisages the payment of a first tranche of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion is expected to be approved by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescue companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that it will be able to resell when the turmoil passes.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the seizure procedures for housing attached to the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and starting allowances paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
In fact, votes continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
It’s not about benefiting taxpayers.”
Animator of a small group in Congress dubbed the "Caucus of Skeptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up on acquiring its insolvent competitor since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion to the U.S. in the loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s exactly something that savers and households appreciate now that the times are getting uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalizing another bank plagued by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take back all of the loans underway at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government is expected to nationalize since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
Its beauty in the eyes of the azure was for a long time its asset card, some will say its weakness.
Was he freed from the narcissistic mirror, the charming American actor?
Yes and no.
His pudding, sensibility, and a talent that flowed from source will also have removed him from the register of power that engenders the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday at the age of 83 after lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast-paced years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked like and to whom he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality mark.
For he projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television, and soon in cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the shadow areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the cracks of the show-business, whose puzzle will not have been completely perforated.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has brought dizziness to filmmakers this weekend, as his big roles on the black screen of memories clash.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parade through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a Burning Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we mention his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many more Paul Newman have gone into history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly miscarriage in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and revenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take on the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 for nine nominations.
This face through the ages, it was him.
It's him again.
Times are swirling through his path.
Young people know him mainly through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With one last role as patron of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends who abandoned the profession early enough, Newman would remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fasts and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging its overly supported performances.
The profession has not always been tender to the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles long fell all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginalists: neurosed, alcoholic, scoundrel or desperate, whose perfect traits reflect drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed facets of his true pudic sensibility.
Her son Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel by the Canadian actress Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of pudding and sadness.
Among the tributes that rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former gunman Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generousness, love of existence are vibrating traits of the missing actor.
In addition to his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drifts.
We will have seen a lot of his binette crown on pots of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gag at first.
However, the proceeds from these sales were paid to the Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be engaged to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
Model citizen, in sum and above.
What could Zuschlag & amp; Company make in their invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damages. Other indictments have been held against them, such as forgery and use of fakes.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and the municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went into the cash registers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and, on the other hand, into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch the money of the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of costs, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they bought billboards at the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, while they made the envelopes in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados, at the request of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they would introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "discovery circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jövöért Foundation, which would later bear the name Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was bursting with errors of form and background.
A guesthouse, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there.
Invoice issuers with the overwhelming imagination also fell into the excess, when they mentioned Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>ért nor Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>'s name appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew it was fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the seal."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people lived there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not find out about the travel agencies of Budapest, which are part of their choice, but only organising trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be settled in cash, which also goes against the practice.
In addition, as shown during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while travel services, which are located outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp in the order of Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>ért was incorrect, since the company's services do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in mentioning as a service the carriage of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued by the order of Együtt a Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation, XXI Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC3><0xA1>s Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sports internship of Kunfehert<0xC3><0xB3>, both of which deny the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at their home.
Invoices Deliberately Established
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, has established an invoice to the Együtt Foundation and Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, for a sum of HUF four million.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003, issued invoices to the Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület.
There was no financial movement, either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was well avoided by the agencies to mention it in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of the company Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., dealing with the trade of fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices relating to the sale of IT equipment, for an amount of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment were allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also reportedly sent documents relating to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he had issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Együtt at the Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredérdélf<0xC3><0xA1>ny, and that he had embezzled their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian Freemasons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were functioning, which the accused explains by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He used these companies, however, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and drafter of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xAD>a<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA3>o.
Kubatov has donated 15 invoices to organizations, in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor's office believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's subsidy application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>n et Szövetség a Modern Magyar<0xC5><0x91>sz<0xC3><0xA1>ll<0xC3><0xA1>g (Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>n et Sövetség a Modern Magyar<0xC5><0x91>sz<0xC3><0xA1>ll<0xC3><0xA1>ny) introduced a subsidy application to the socialist party’s public utility body, the T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Foundation (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy for an amount of HUF 500,000 twice, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of manufacturing the invoices, as she had done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the Socialists would have concluded an agreement according to which in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since applications for his placement in supervised residence, based on a relief from his detention conditions, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf man.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, await at their own home the end of the procedure.
The psychology of over-the-counter: why do we spend more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans don’t want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that’s why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These researches have attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a play auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants were able to earn money, but during the auction of which an essential element is the over-auction of a third, the ensemble under the brain stem, called the striatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, economists from this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups oversold in front of a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and so they carried out their placement.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received the $15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was on victory in one group, while in the other group, on failure.
Proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in the face of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now giving rise to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York's Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: When Should I See a Doctor?
Around the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that patients with the hepatitis virus are 100 miles away in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment, which is because patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and the diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g.: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through the blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travelers are advised to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to get the virus, because the pathogenic gene sourly destroys the cells of the liver. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your treating doctor as soon as the observation of symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of a cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the sick from around the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article in which researchers from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing how much faith in God could influence human pain tolerance.
As part of this experiment, for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experiment takes place as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not much different from the first, carried on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either religious-themed or more general-themed painting.
The Catholics said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as someone they were "care for" and they "calmed down, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting as a religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
“We should find an image they are responding to very positively, such as a mother or a father,” he said.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same calibre is shown to the believers?
Would the sight of a better Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of people’s pockets in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their interests.
However, this is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While as far as sceptics are concerned paralleling Orwell’s vision of horror, they don’t see much of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to meet their original goal: “Let’s collect all the information from the world in a system!”
According to the CEO of Google, after ten years of global work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What work would I do best?". However, the software users will be able to answer this kind of question, just as it does in the first place, only on the first day.
It is not entirely clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then viewed by interested people are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, long-term, recommendations, pre-recommendations, pre-received products based on the same logic, will be able to provide us with more personalized answers.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are concerned about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-minded internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, upside down with the electronic legal protection body EFF, proved its right to the court against the FBI. According to the judgment given, whether in the future is F<0xC3><0xA8>r<0xC3><0xA8>, Google will still not be obliged to ask for information on this.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years earlier. But in the end, it was unable to obtain the lists of these two websites and websites from private users.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is shaken by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private and private spheres suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they conserve their society against them in the manifest spirit of revolt.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wild people" bringing together the enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see on Google the next generation of big companies, the "branch-based corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, and all of them, the same cause of invading the world.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, draws right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, but the fact that we deliberately leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or to last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a follow-up system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
While one can get acquainted with many private examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her infidel friend spent the evening, or the thing of the company that can be re-appointed to date one of our employees, is nothing but for the top opinions of sincere blogging that one.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how one can define the principle behind the behavior of today’s young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scrooge, using the Google search system, but at the same time, deliberately leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the smallest. The services of Google online, from the processing of text to the image processing, to the reading of information to our best can be replaced by this profiling.
The public is waiting, without really hiding it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains alone are threatening the revenues of other ad agencies, but are not threatening the revenues of more ad agencies.
However, in this way, the critical observers agree that, in addition to all this, there are contradictions that have a worrying effect: for example, the top management of the company rejected, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the company's nursery and after the company decided that it was too expensive the restoration.
According to one of the company's internal rules of the company, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is on, is that in the coming months and years, they will make the world move on new points. While some think of it, we will scan and archive it from books.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a gruesome way only through Google data.
Two juveniles helped to eradicate traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd's double homicide
"Police have summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd. Based on reasonable suspicions, they helped to make traces of the crime disappear," - said a spokesperson for the department's commissioner of Borsod.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are being accused of, and for the time being, they are being accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder can lead to a detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old young man from the corner, was placed in provisional detention on Sunday.
The indictments against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the young daughter of this man, aged 9 years.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of it.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid so far made for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new best owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of the shares, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is aggravating day by day, the leading newspapers of the European press are already mentioning a "second 9/11".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American president," the daily La Repubblica said. "The president was not even able to block his own party behind a bill, improvised in haste, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary’s bow in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the shortcomings of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and afterwards, the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, but according to the congressional vote, a real threat, one that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just at a time when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer, says the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still lend a lifeline to their bullying financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers’ money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will suffice.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to make few cases of their national selfishness, and to centralise control over divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Vienna daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to redress the crisis.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is traversing, on the one hand, the old continent.
The "saviors" should not immediately make a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise to note in which case it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing more damage.
The smart car mimics the flight of the bourdon
What method would be better to develop technologies that are capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, the bees.
In the astonishing project presented at CEATEC, which takes place in Japan, buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of starting, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a robotic mini car, a bio-inspired self-roboted control system, type BR23C, that it has equipped with bee qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval-shaped, which in reality looks a lot like our safe protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the brand's research and development and technological public relations department.
The bee's facetted eye plays a primary role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the facet eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If this were not the case, the mini auto robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where at the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotational movement, acceleration and slowing as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentrate is larger, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don’t need memory with a capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology that serves instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entrance into mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles in its path.
We even gave the baby a name out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, aimed at repurchasing dubious loans from banks, and to be used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announced that during new debates lasting until after midnight, Saturday, on the east coast, Congressional leaders have agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days, around the $700 billion bailout plan.
“We have taken a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which it remains to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said, commenting on the outcome of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question here of saving Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
Moreover, the program diverges from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which she mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent at one time, for the purchase of securities on dubious credits.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the passage of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to additionally use the Président to purchase dubious 100-dollar bills from the banks.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, to buy dubious receivables, securities relating to dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" receivables.
The department's competent persons stated that the purchases can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to dedicate $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it be the extensive redemption of dubious claims, insurance, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system leading to the major collapse of one or the other institution.
"We will take the necessary measures, to be ready for the implementation of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect their starting compensation, simply called the Atlantic Golden Parachute, to be ceilinged by the government.
Salary ceilings are only mentioned in very specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury offers its assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back in the course of an auction, they will charge an excess of the golden parachute tax, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the repayment of the doubtful claims, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, however, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap only applies to new contracts, this is to motivate participation in the plan.
“This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place on appointments of directors-general,” said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services.
In addition, the State obtains a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may even be profitable in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that within the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will determine how the losses will be repaid to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why US citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayers’ dollars — said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pushing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise.
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to the month of August 2007 - reports the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to those in July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices have increased to a lesser extent: by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry have only experienced a slight increase in the order of 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), with first, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, then, the production of shoes with a 2.5 percent monthly increase.
The higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the product and chemicals manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the petroleum processing (1.4 per cent), manufacturing of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing, and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry saw an increase of between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent a significant weight in domestic industrial operations, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the rise in gas prices put in place by the authorities since July 1.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, the prices of the oil processing sector have experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacturing sector of metallurgical products, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions occurred in the textile and textile products (2.5 per cent) and in the manufacturing of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the price increase has evolved between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
In the entire processing industry, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to the allocation of sectors, in August, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was reported by the investment-initiating sectors.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices have increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material producing sectors for further processing have not changed compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while for the profit-making sectors, it decreased by 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices in the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment decreased by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into effect, as the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
“Now, it all depends only on the time when the transatlantic electronic entry and control systems will be put into operation.”
All the time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today, in Washington.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Cross of Commander with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, McCain and Democrat Barack Obama.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank bailout plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, secured their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout plan, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.
After days and days of marathon negotiations, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced Sunday morning that they had reached agreements in principle on the bailout plan for banks.
This funding plan, aimed at freezing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain present themselves, each as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with the rise of economic issues, Obama has once again managed to get a bit ahead, and McCain’s advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a harvester just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains consumer protection passages which he also supports.
“It is now time to act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industries and the stability of the entire economy,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have trouble swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator stated that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury control committee and the ceiling on the starting allowances of senior leaders, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no background role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Newspaper of the German Linguistic Territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have been transforming Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to have happened just ten years ago came to an end: the undisputed hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU recovered at 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is to say, in the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization of "devouring his parents", established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists have announced this, but they have been greatly mistaken about the pace. However, the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of North and East Germans in the developing Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the Germans.
Modernization goes hand in hand with the increase in opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have strayed rather far from the CSU, such as independents, craftsmen, baccalaureate holders and graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 per cent.
The press (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of confusing domestic politics that took place after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> want to discuss with the conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from meddling in its internal affairs.
The populist BZ<0xC3><0x96> party is open to negotiations and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates organized on public television, party leaders have barely allowed their cards to be seen.
Werner Faymann, the chairman of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would envision a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP president, as vice-chancellor, remains open by Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is temporarily a completely open question and these points must be debated in the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is once again open to all proposals.
“To avoid the coalition of the reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right of Roma children in their lives.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka warned that in addition to the distinctions found during the hiring, the Roma disappear from the labor market, first of all, as a result of their low qualification.
“The overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have a high school diploma, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a graduate degree.”
In addition, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka stressed that education as an elementary human right plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By virtue of their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education," - stressed L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, an objective-oriented EU cooperation and action is needed for an immediate acceleration of the process of de-segregation of schools, and compliance with the existing and in preparation for anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment; we must give the opportunities guaranteed by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
In the name of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" assured for all, the objective of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe, held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support the measures taken at the European level in favour of equal opportunities and in the fight against discrimination.
CSU: The Grace for a Transition Period
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be made
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The party president, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic vote loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the party’s exceptional congress, held the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of this highly criticised pair made it feel like they were not holding their seat in particular.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the coup against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria's "only sovereign" giving 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
But conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, which is key to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which proposes a long-running discussion with the Liberals of the FDP.
A strange nostril of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Voters, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as an opportunity to putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then to treat the very ambitious woman municipal politics without homework.
Now CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role.The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU, which he said deserved much more support from the Brotherhood.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel can only be chancellor again if they get back up in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly concealing her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats is still going on.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukashenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
No member of the opposition has joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature consisting of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants passed very well opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) when it changed the "seriously" by changing it to the "Lukashenko, renewing its mandate".
In this way, the ODSZ relinquished its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia economically, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians, who are still in charge of the Russian government, are not in the process of obtaining visas, was one of the expectations of the Russian government.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than flaws, such as the ban on appearing for a third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday already contested the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were counted.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and the Abbazia from then onwards to recognize both the Confederate and the Confederate conpierts, who formed a conpierre with the Georgian.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has been started," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remain so, despite the fact that "power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, even to bring in a single opponent".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions in view of the results, rather it is trying to send its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to have our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, local authorities put us sticks in the wheels for what is the distribution, but I can also see that they really are more and more concerned about the social that makes the elections, even in the main circle of the elderly"
"Due to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, evoking the silence of a cemetery, is no longer a matter of time," Milinkevitch said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, who heads the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of the elections.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had we had revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the little melancholy, against who is pointing and then going to drink the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-smoker novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“Turning doors are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” says Brunetta.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta added.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees has been recorded, the secretary-general assures: "This is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissants.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In Rome, the minister said that “in three months, the absences of disease of public employees decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in one year”.
And he adds that it is imperative to make public administration more efficient.
Italian, "including the wage dynamics-- explains the minister--the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and far beyond the inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"while the Minister of Public Works is now spreading data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness," the Consumers' Association writes, "the people of the "active smokers" continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration came together to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar contests the exclusion of additional allowances in the case of invalidity due to service; the extension of the hours of residence of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of the Victims of Work Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of the Mutilated and Invalid Workers.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continued associative effort in favour of workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and raising public awareness.
"Naturally outraged, everyone has hit the fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness among young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain our attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed how “this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, a concrete effort to end it quickly”.
The data on the accidents at work seems to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this ‘discounting trend’ to actually translate into less attention, because it’s precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy comes.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
“In our opinion, Mercandelli stressed, more checks and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school.”
- He added- "there is still an effort to be made in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration in the conditions of safeguarding the envisaged compensation for victims of work" and the "assistance drift to which the system has been oriented in recent years".
"The objective, therefore, is to give the worker the assurance of insurance, so that the fate of the person who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneity or enlargement of the legislature."
Finger pointing Mp3 player, they endanger hearing.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a communiqué circulated in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified (Csrseri) health risks of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific report we read in the note, 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music in full volume using portable musical devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," said Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is raising consumer awareness and making this domain information public.
In addition, we need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow up on new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concluded the EU executive confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents' devices and devices, if they prove to be safe from exposure to music.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit this data using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, currently exceed the limits for the maximum level of noise agreed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods of time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This affects 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitole for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermen of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so that in June they will present the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - Alemanno points out - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council, can use.
No overlap of roles, but only the will to have a corner to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, she will finish her tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a specific time duration.
In June-announce the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure that its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look forward, and beyond, to a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic ensemble: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will be used to study and engage the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immovable, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unified spirit, ".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and should have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who likes to pretend to be independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, for his part, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he always does today, as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
“Obama is really skewed: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that don't say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? And we have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern United States wrote an article: Once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is where an aspect of the American mentality, kept secret until the end, emerges.
“If you say what you want, we’ll even see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge job to do.
In the U.S., the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of the newspaper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly stated to the information attachés, feeling less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors are working on assembling the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if one wishes that traditional journalism as the general public hears it, is not reduced consistently.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper reporters are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses were struggling with a transition to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of the newspaper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using the technology in the hope that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hurdle in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to "safety at work".
Directors who plan to lose their jobs within three years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
The one of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, etc.) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It is the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REST A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol-Bnl escalation instruction.
During the trial in his charge last week, he had obtained the release of his home converted into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago, with the House of Representatives voting, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this to us by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its early East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, in the Centre's conservative, hostile to "the money of Washington" and to the world's finances.
The soul, precisely, which made itself feel despotic with the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is just an example of the changes, the major changes that the ongoing economic earthquake either predicts or already lets happen: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not just be here.
In the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena covered for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the double category of sovereign state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which are, above all, involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost national here.
Political internationalisation does not seem to be at stake or has much to say: the obvious proof is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, is shared between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a condition of credit: when one goes through a difficult period, there are only the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put them back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is, after all, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we have now entered the realm of network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now always destined to dominate the world with little to dominate it, we realized at once against them, that our futur
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but that are absolutely related to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
Now I come to the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow.
And furthermore, something even deeper, in a sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites up to now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds in an underground way, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which could be manifested in the "revolts" of the improvised elections, or, in the changes of the collective moods of the Italians, it did not conserve to the work of the Italians.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, it would seem, always have more difficulty, which does not date from today's potentially economical way, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of the crisis of societies.
In view of all this, talking about a current “mass rebellion” on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But they say, keep your eyes wide open, it is not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Overcome the laws of gravity through super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called nanocarbon tubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a spaghetti pile," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow to ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "easily detachs itself from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at Day's faculty.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
May be to walk on walls like Spiderman? May be yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superhero.
OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair, which self-cleanses dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Pay attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are dehydrating and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter their amplifying or decreasing absorption, as the case may be, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether they are, in cans or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Health Meeting of the American Chemical Society's staff at the American Chemical Society.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized for being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stimulated and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
MEDICINES AT RISK- It is the Italian Agency of the drug itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink, if you take the Mémzé or Diapa, for example.
According to experts, even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit the use of medications.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informational notes of the medicines.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs you take, and, if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but address clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert told the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked many controversy, and which was blamed on the economist for years, but which now turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive "disseminator", particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, the third edition of the “anti-Microsoft” package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year of work done by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the ISO-reviewed interface and became less austere, to the latest standard, to newer, newer, formatted version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, for sending them by e-mail, or for importing PDF files into the graphic design module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
On this front, it is always possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe-format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or text developer.
Multi-person collaboration is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on modifications, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of free will can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office subsequently tries the big challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and support service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent writing video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graph module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, one can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, it is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the shirt of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl samples are part of those carried out in recent weeks, by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press, that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian took to the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, sparkling the top climber’s pea jersey.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES REQUESTS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times, which devoted a long article on the topic of racism in Italy, devoted to the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are both the ones where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega."
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic emphasized the trend: "Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of exclusion of entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high global costs that families from which they come must support," explains the head of the department of studies in the Sunia department, Laura Mariani, who was responsible for the development of these cities.
In most cases, the rental offers also involve a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, no rental limit, sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the taxation are needed to calm the prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza zone, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from a minimum of 650 euros (zone Bande Nere), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vitttoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values slightly lower (550 euros for a single) for areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
One can only save if one moves away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 euros for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or the like.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, it is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, register a further anomaly: the rent requested from foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities feed the historic halls.
Historical cinemas close in favor of multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of the marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, it is often historical places and charged with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of the way and so many emotions" observes the one that the director of the Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, and the first film of the film, which he offers to Tornatore 20.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: over the last five years, 316 traditional-type cinemas have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have mostly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Palermo and Tur, 6 less in Rome.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is at the top with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 additional screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a farm in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily all willing to go multiplex to.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of the credit in favour of merchants: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote mono-room cinemas in the historical centers and in the outskirts.
The regulations envisaged include measures of tax facilitation for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna with other measures.
However, it is obvious that, to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had already thought of for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much of shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the panels blackened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piramalli clan."
Severe charges have been brought by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his son lawyer, homonymous to the boss, already convicted for association of criminals of the mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Ma<0xC3><0xAE>tre Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan," write the judges, "to officially enter the town halls, facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Drangheta, heroes who are honest."
The arrests this morning followed those in July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piramalli clan.
By the end of April last year, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; as early as 1991, and still due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried out to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the then deputy interior minister, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating everything for a political issue, but given the incarceration request signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piramalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 draft.
From the orderly interceptions against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, emerged "the willingness to match the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piramalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes from the waves, now the big ones launch.
This is an excessive deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which giants like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now they are trying to get their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has now been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now ecologists and the new rise in oil are giving a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore systems.
This amount would be twice that of nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides..
Colossians attacking.
The first company to focus on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in the north of Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, one would have said a real revolutionary step.
Two years after that, more and more candidates among these companies have always been dedicated to traditional energy bet on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying technologies on ocean energy,” said a spokesperson for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant, the Wall Street Journal, and is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that precisely in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for further excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are New York’s Greenland Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power, which traverse the path of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, according to the observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology even in its early days, apart from the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher ecological impact.
And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure causes a turbine to rotate, which in turn, feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
At the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Greening Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines on the East River in New York.
The movement of water during tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the permits needed to extract energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves at this time, the potential of the tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable by wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coasts, invested $7.5 million in 2008, and anticipates investments up to $35 million in 2009.
