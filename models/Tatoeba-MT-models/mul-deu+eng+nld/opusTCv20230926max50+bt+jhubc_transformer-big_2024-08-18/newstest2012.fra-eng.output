Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymoshenko
As part of an amendment to the criminal law, the Ukrainian parliament rejected the draft annulment of the paragraph on the accusation of Yulia Tymoshenko, the head of the opposition.
In the second reading, MEPs rejected the proposed amendment to reduce penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for concluding an a priori unfavourable deal with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court must rule on the defendant's appeal in December.
Tymosenko called the regime’s political vengeance judgment and provoked a process of suspicion of court bias also in the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MEPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victories
Liberation or Libyan rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to be determined who wins.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary law of the Sharia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a theft one cuts off the hand.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible disrespectful of her faith are subject to capital punishment...
It is the Qur’an that will unite instead of the dictator’s personality the society of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent it and as we would certainly not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best, and would probably not benefit Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist warriors have accepted the help with recognition of the infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated every attack.
When it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crossers".
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will eventually boast of a selfless protection of human rights.
As little as we can prevent these adherents of Sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eye of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published the GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market breaks all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published their visions of economic development for the third quarter earlier.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, while France's GDP is expected to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated, and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that there is a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts' predictions.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to data forecasted and periodically recalculated.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
The yields of the bonds of Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
Problems are beginning to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation in the region worsens.
Voices are heard in Germany saying that the ECB should be the ultimate guarantee .
The Czechs have qualified for the Euro.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrated the qualifier for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also defended with a good deal of luck in the second half of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech national team also won thanks to the super Chech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure until the second half due to a precise Czech defense.
Victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the box of Czech football.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were hard to come up with combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not come to break through the Czech defense, which accurately responded to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They have created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program with this gesture in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities created a human shield on Tuesday around the Ispahan nuclear technology center where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country ' s dark agenda at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest report that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is reported in Israel.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes charcuterie for dinner
More than a third of 9 to 13-year-olds have problems with overweight, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the patterns around him.
On the tables of obese children, for example, charcuterie is found 50% more often than in families of normal weight children.
19% of obese people had chips at dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of small adults, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 sixth to third grade students have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough exercise.
“For example, only half of the children surveyed reported eating breakfast five times a day — lunch — snack — dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet,” one of the survey results said.
Without breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most of the families, everyone has their own breakfast.
And the worst thing that has been found is that one tenth of the population does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy chips are consumed more often.
Almost every student – not to mention their weight – drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of children surveyed do sports regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare Your Diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet from possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
“The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal, in terms of healthy eating.”
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is particularly a great preference for sweet lemonades," the results of the survey said.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place just in front of the white meat.
The children did not want any starch at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading on Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
“During a survey of a group of survey participants who filled out the questionnaire after the ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’ awareness session, a determined desire to move towards a healthy diet was felt,” the survey results said.
The most notable was, for example, for sweet lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked white meat and fish as the main dish on the questionnaire and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour balls or potatoes).
The stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it's gonna be worse.
The closer we approach the final exams and the more practical exercises and information are expected.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "drunk".
This time we discussed with Director Alenka (there are no boys at the moment) how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically assemble wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to beautifully emphasize the character and also not to dress too visibly of the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth doing it on a bespoke basis.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides constantly, wraps up and doesn’t stick to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that there's too much to do at home.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress"Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know of the Victoria's Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, it makes me happy, because it is better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (don’t take my statement, please, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as it is said for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physics, but for example creates the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, entertained us from all this.
But this,... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diversified look to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single outfit in a different way.
The variability is for this prime example.
For example, this trench coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with boots and take a photo of it as a dress.
Or simply raise your sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
“You can then start to violate it,” Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do with, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No comments on the fashion show.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is, for a fashion story that will have about a dozen pages (so about a dozen templates) I must be ready to "cut" at least a fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to rely on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half the success has been confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists remains frivolous.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them to be useless (I only know something but what I seem to pass in the second rank).
And if someone gets styling on our part, then we have to count on the fact that he dictates to us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
It remains for us then to navigate on google and make sure if the boulevard info report the celebrity in question, whether it has lean or fat etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient themselves in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he wears and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not flattering, keeping your opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort out his closet and fill it with new items you can’t throw it all away and say to him, ‘My God, what a horror.’”
“You’ll find some things that you’ll find pretty and he’ll advise you on what to wear with them,” Mario says.
He has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the size and that you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or feeder pins, there are also nylon threads (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips that can be used to make the cutlery or other cutlery with which one closes a garment in the back (if it is too large).
So that we were not just people who listen but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to reseal shoes correctly.
And during the photo session in the studio where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, mostly on the outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We had no right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
Therefore, skills are really needed.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a brief summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes
I’m starting to understand more and more that doing styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed Le Run is disputed throughout the Americas.
Revision
Originally, a problem-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
It fulfills to some extent everyone’s ambition but it’s useless if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the old Need for Speed racing series and to come out a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious what the added passages would be where the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already the case in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole shoots down due to a few unnecessary faults that already exist for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible misunderstanding on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and to settle them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on a different route and the planned steps in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are especially pretty even though the graphical technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
After all, this is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are additionally occasionally accommodated with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly diminishes your visibility.
Then in the mountains you need to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition to this, the different races are well organized one after the other.
There are only a small number of them, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the number of opponents requested (as in a classic race) then you run against the watch (classic duel with the timer) and then another duel with an opponent awaits you.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the passages out of the vehicle.
This is rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by tapping on the right button at the right time.
It's not complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, this is how it is because this element does not risk disturbing and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that aggravate the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at the moment there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said that it is negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you’ll have to go somewhere else.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the model of driving, the model of collisions is not yet ready.
We do not expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it is not completely good.
During tight overruns you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car starts out in crazy volts.
Or maybe he's in a mess.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really bothers you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you broke your figure or went out in the decor the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts don't help and you need to find the solution by remembering the piece of itinerary in question.
The great hiccup of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are certain bends that must be passed in a certain way or else it will not pass.
Otherwise you meet at a given location of "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or a minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you easily see the opponent passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and turn them or brake them.
It doesn’t matter if you go ahead of him because it is “calculated” in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
During the entire time of the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent who precedes you in the same place.
This gets the most upset at the end of the game when you ride on a long deck in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter into collision a number of times.
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredalin, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it doesn’t matter if it’s because of the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You have to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the routes as you can change cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic atours on highly technical rides, for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places that you know about the adventure, goes very well with the main diet of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog feature, which among other things compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other features in the community.
One of the hardest hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway that sends the car directly to the railroad.
In the editorial board we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really think we are idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What is disturbing is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases in a tragic way.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is at your choice.
In order to please as many as possible and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn’t have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
The fun is really good but prepare for mistakes typing in your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The velvet students in concert with the choirs of Charles University

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically eroded the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she succeeded in describing the various EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way that a large number of lecturers from Charles University's Faculty of Law could envy her, she showed how serious she takes her motto "understandable and open about Europe."
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
“From the beginning, the criticisms resonated that he’s fad, that he’s a leather round, that he can’t fulfill any mission, and I have to say that he took his breath away from everyone because he holds his role to perfection.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe.”
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards unity and greater readability of the Union's policy to the States.
Nobody wants to ban us our syrecky (cooked pasta cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that has lived, lived and will live in a time close to the European Council.
She has qualified the Czech Presidency as a success two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the upward financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has been full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
In addition, the new seventh budget of the Union must be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and with a view to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, bananas that are different size or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.”
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
In addition, it is regrettable to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, according to her, is due to several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and poor support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Poles, the Magyars, the Slovaks come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?' and he's not happy at all."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future there are hard new rules on fiscal policy that await member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at multiple speeds, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the zone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institute."
In the first place, it was said that countries who want it co-operate with each other and those who do not want it remain in their corner."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," said Vicenova.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all the issues affecting the EU should be debated among all EU members and not just the memes of the eurozone.

IBM Innovator Begins the Second Century of Its Existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expresses IBM’s strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be “the long-term.”
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the company’s first leader, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for as little as people are willing to think.
His motto “THINK!” has become the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture carefully crafted by Watson.
For us, IBM means long-term thinking of continuous forward-looking movements.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it still remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, started to take care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only among the first U.S. employees to have paid vacations, employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
Society was at first brilliant in discovering talents—as one of the first firms to abolish any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman--Virginia Rometty--who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing what’s called jammy, online brainstorming, from which a lot of future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a safe position in the field of business.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world using its technology,” added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM – or the “Great Blue,” as it is familiarly called in the United States with its slogan – in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the world’s largest firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
It holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM was the second-largest technology firm in terms of market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example failed to bet on a clean OS/2 operating system, the Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance you can’t emotionally stay stuck on the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor that is at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenue, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a predominant place.
However, even in 1990 it was with more than the motive of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
Starting in the year 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, over that period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it passed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Economic Crisis also increased its investment volume.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without worrying?
The price of the IBM stock has progressed from 2008 to a 120 percent rocket, the company’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to take control of other crises.
IBM's History: From Cheese slices to Spaceflights.
The IBM (International Business Machines) company was born in New York a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was renamed IBM in 1924 – it was originally a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is related to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that so far rest the identity and culture of the company.
Watson led the firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce – from cheese and meat slicers to checkout boxes.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue grew to $9 million and the company began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management, it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers – the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer factory to Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high value added.
The strategy that IBM has succeeded in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept “a smarter planet.”
Its objective is to intelligently harness technology in areas that are not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as commerce is concerned, IBM recently developed a “Smart Commerce” platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center of Brno.
Central Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the global research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
If you can keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she couldn’t wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner"explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in the summer in her house, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa did not push back the singer.
And he admitted in public that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband’s bond and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
“He’s my son’s biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common home, nobody will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my old beloved and lost donkey, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has separated from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I will stay with Iveta and will not change."
“My wife set up a paper wedding and I respect it.”
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I have a completely normal conversation, but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not prevent it.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes, who she has a relationship with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Does it concern you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to get them "out of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines the female vices that come to pump the blood from the veins of men.
The purchases
Does your half make remarks that you are addicted to purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one clothes a week?
Are you happy to buy and parcel at the time of sales?
In your case, you can talk about buying as a vice.
Some women think that they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you will say, who would resist the stained glass of clothing stores, to look for themselves beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for men.
Just remember how many times you have told your spouse that he or she is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do I like you?"
Don't these phrases remind you of something?
Yeah? Yeah.
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the issue that you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints are, and the more women become toxic.
Odor and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, dust, uncover the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have sali the sink, stained the living room glass, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this particular obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of Sape
"With this worn-out suit in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this sap work on your partner in this way several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn’t have to do so much sapwork...
Defamation, Persiflation
Defamation, persiflation but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly attracted to relationships and thus are happy to treat topics like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us will let go of a little harmless persiflation here and there.
The hand on the heart is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevere, even despise others and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially at work in a collective of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jagr took part twice in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is once again at the forefront of the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who has yet to make one more pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told reporters from overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes that feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his Giroux action scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second attack from the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind Hurricane goals for the palette and presented it to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said.
“I never thought I’d play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.
"I'm really happy with that."
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years in the NHL the other players in the team have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shootout she ends up with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended in two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He taped on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came out in second third due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadiens did not face an experienced defender their two goal advance lost after a penalty shootout by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was sick which mainly bothered the local coach rather than lost points because they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's nothing."
“We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.
“But there’s nothing to do, it’s like that,” says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn’t resist.”
“We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our zone.”
For that we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender who took part in the 30th attack in Winnipeg and victory over Tampuu Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the jets' uax goals, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter otherwise individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to queue up all night with a sleeping bag or have "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for currencies that was the condition for traveling to the west was refused to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The travels of the Czechs have been undergoing a major revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at the maximum,the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in neighbouring countries of the West has caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for long travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel agencies had Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip at that time was to bring with him his own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which finally allowed our tourists after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as average wages have increased, leading to another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the growing demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours since 1997 with air charters that, thanks to contracts, have dramatically reduced costs compared to before.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most of the developed countries around the world except the US, which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development happened in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully rank in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, for the first time in history, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history again spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for a holiday abroad including appendices.
The General Assembly must find its President but this could end in an unresolved situation "one pat"
For almost 5 months Czech football has been without a President and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic will not yet be known after another General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which rules of procedure to proceed with the vote.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football returned to divergences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to vote.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, he thinks, the statutory representatives or also the officials invested with full powers.
At this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office of State and Law, that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still disagreements about the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also contributed nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The apple of discord lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the third round wins the one of the candidates who will have received the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw in order to win the candidate who will have received the highest percentage of votes in both chambers.
And the Czech side studies the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the votes.
“Only that would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept,” admits Svoboda, who understands the Moravian party’s objections and says that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the settlement of the elections established by the statutes is the most Pelta advantage among all the candidates.
"I want to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
“So that there are not yet any salvage ideas imagined by a representative as during the previous General Assembly,” said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his speeches defined himself mainly against Pelta.
They are still optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymburk and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"The qualifying for the European Championship today should calm down everyone."
"Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there is more training for cooperation," adds the Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in football management both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the rules to draw."
"This may again cause a blockade of the General Assembly."
"I still hope that common sense will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire direction of the football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee to the field of reprisals.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts within the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union that must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the fight for the post of President because he sees no right candidate.
If Plzen head of football Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put into campaigning for this high office.
"If there is such a candidate, I support him, I fight for him and I don't run for office."
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to precisely try to prevent Pelta from entering the AFRT's headline, which would be a priori given favor for this election.
Paclik also points out that should he win the election, he would hold the post of President only until 2013, the year planned for a General Assembly.
He would look good in the role as an experienced and high-level manager but who is not connected to the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at this time."
“I would like to change that image,” he added.
What, it is said, is particularly disturbing to Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates ' the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he wins, the current state will remain and there will be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, it would be even less favourable to football," Paclik said.
What is still shocking is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during a hearing in the context of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta came out without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club from Plzen".
In case Paclik wins Thursday’s vote, he should prove he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He [Pelta] would be the first I'd go with."
“He has great capabilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able to."
"I'm not putting my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew a lot of attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the Arbitrators' Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and also since last year he has also led the club of Plzen, which with his support last May celebrated his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not seek his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also envisage harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power from high-level policies would make it possible to obtain more money from the gaming tax for the sport.
“This is one of the key issues that the new president should address.”
“If it’s about the gambling tax as political parties state, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even if he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again linked to Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
“This is not the ideal.”
I see no reason to pass on my Plzen club shares to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has pledged new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future disputes about the settlement for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic before Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk and thinks that today’s success of the football performance should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election that did not take place, has justly promised to dedicate itself to national representation and obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president to come Thursday.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he added, but he is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, who has worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That’s also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone noticed.”
“If there were not all these different interpretations, we would have had a President since September,” Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has caught the attention of the delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I’m ready to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn’t work.”
“It’s a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he strives, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes in terms of his training in law and that he knows appropriately that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice President.
He has also long not attacked Tonas Paclik, who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
“He’s been playing football for a year now and has already had some successes.”
"However, his attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"It's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent's address but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national representation.
It should be a vitrine of football.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for the whole of football," the 46th candidate told the Czech press agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not bring any change in people.
“I should get to know all the employees,” he told Strahov, where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios foreseen with the General Assembly, he thinks delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there’s only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head,” Pelta optimistically says two days before the probably decisive day for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl pledges that under his direction the AFRT will begin to work hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's General Assembly it would not please a lot of people, he seems.
Rajchl promises, however, that in case he is elected we will start working hard.
It wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for the youth."
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
"And I'm going to distribute difficult missions so that football can take a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He has stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“About me, you know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I'm going to have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on each of my actions," he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up because they would also give up.”
“It’s a confidence that I can’t betray,” he says.
What motivates him, it is also said, is to continue the work started with Hasek.
“Over the last two years, there has been a lot of hard work and I don’t want to let it go.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I don't want anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta, the situation within the Union will not return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and it’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
"Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen."
"You can accuse me of a number of things but certainly not to bear any of them."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen.
And he reaffirms once again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
“And if anyone says otherwise, I’m ready to do the maximum for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to consider splitting the second division into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would end up in the first division.”
“There wouldn’t be a situation like this with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
“I am constantly feeling support from the Czech House that elected me its Vice-President and know that with me there will be successes,” said Rajchl, who contemplates among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on televised contracts and on disadvantaged, unfortunate, unfortunate contracts.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footballer would lose his credibility", he thinks that second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can doubt Plzen has done a great job this year.”
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who was evaluating his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
Julia Stanek
UFO sightings, magnificent Budapest pools: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle – and after touring the city or taking a long walk – can let their tired legs rest in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was one item that should not be missed in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretching on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and was swimming against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and was not lacking in admiring the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she noted in her notebook without delay all the details of the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain). The municipal indoor swimming pools of Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "concrete buildings in the Tadcore".
She has conducted her "most exceptional bathing trips in Central Europe" in 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true fan of bathing culture.
Meder explains that she doesn’t have much interest in the sport but he feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimmers should just look at blue tiles and accommodate the scent of Javel’s water while joggers breathe in the enchanting scent of spice forests or can listen to the park’s joyous birding.
"I once wondered why the pools should in fact always be so shallow," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dip in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a wellness factor in the swimming pools are huge because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming pools could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming pools."
"It is transparent on one side, but reflects the beauty of the entire building on the other."
All surfaces are presented optically in a double way: high vaults, multi-colored tiles, stairs.
The small-format image volume "Badefrieden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths in <0xC3><0x81>szd<0xC3><0xB3> whose tubs are filled in <0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC3><0xA1> formV<0xC3><0xA1>.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath you can see the whole city, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool which can be seen from the skiing area of St. Anton.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal resembles a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emit a smell of sulfur, from the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emits a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Looking out the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the flowering of weeds between the tiles.
She observed a counter-effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out from its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra-style Moorish room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favourite swimming pool of pool expert Iris Meder – and not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
“It’s already a nice performance to smelt such different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural Speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw from the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities is pushing prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign aligns concretely with Deutsche-Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts meanwhile share the view that gamblers have detached themselves from the offers and demand – and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from US competitors: He promised to investigate the allegations and said, “No business is worth putting at risk the good reputation of Deutsche Bank.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report allegations.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the raw materials market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode hailed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how bankers today are hurting the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything about what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he doesn't have much to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which on November 7 and 8 the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Only 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank’s clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into the commodity speculations.
43 percent would not advise such a bank to their surroundings, 49% answered that they would consider canceling their account to change from banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin.
It is now reopened and is held as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its lively and daring looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress in Brussels58, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect sw is an example of technical progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important stage in contemporary architecture to this day.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern train station of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum – no walls to hang the artwork, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for as long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has increasingly collapsed.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a blow of luck from every point of view.
The new start was carried out by Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she led private sponsorship and public promotion to the protection of the works of transformation.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a library are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: the "building was an energy gap," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced with a particular safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a dazzled light panel between the house and the road provides the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of origin remained, the house is painted in a shade of protection against rust of red-brown color.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the protection office monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and lightweight.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands exactly the newly planned "Central Station" district, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may come: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a multi-million-dollar winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million more in this regard this year.
The Bild-Zeitung newspaper reported earlier, referring to an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of a total of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million would be expected until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway facilities and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to get rid of snow and ice up to the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the necessary track equipment for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, railway station chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit of train accidents that also happened this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is why many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot to do for years, given that it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after an axle break took place on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of fines in the United States.
After the case of chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this sector giant catches up with the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks.
It is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Markets Regulator has brought a whole series of accusations to the big banks, and this has prompted cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost enormous value during the financial crisis and have driven banks downwards.
“We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this issue without the parties initiating a court procedure,” a Deutsche Bank spokesperson said in a statement.
In comparison, the Bank did not admit any faults.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons made now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks in part and in the summer it was assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of mortgage documents, it is referred to as "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit unions are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events date back to a few years, at the moment it is blowing a stormy wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous remedies to seek redress or to sanction deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two financiers of U.S. state real estate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having benefited in nature in mortgage business of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without citing a precise amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett raises $10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests huge sums in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has bought stocks worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has repeatedly explained not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only makes bad forecasts appear.
However, he read IBM’s reports and changed his view on investments in the sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knightly attack in the world of finance.
As a result, IBM's IT business is now entitled to be called "Mr. IBM".
For Buffett today revealed to the economic show CNBC, that he has since March bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a major shareholder of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had secured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services as an “exploitation of accounting centres.”
The IT pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both Software and Consulting as well as high-performance enterprise calculators.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
But on the contrary, Buffett is more concerned with railroad sludge, lubricants or machine manufacturers.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding owns nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück Munich.
This 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and established it as one of the world’s most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock market.
“Big Blue,” also called IBM, has a total market value of over $220 billion and is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubted the state of German law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “blood ideology,” which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a Greek small business in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the spectre that was long thought to be dead has reappeared: since the Mölln fire attacks in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
Whether there is xenophobia in Germany has never been questioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose dimensions are far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "This was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors was allegedly a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right bourbi.
The Turkish community in Germany has reasonably reacted: it called for a silent commemoration of victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a gif: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of unequivocal conditions.
"it's starting to suck," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He points out that people were reportedly murdered, taxed and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The police action was very critically perceived in the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why hasn't it come to the minds of the German authorities much earlier to do research in some suspicious circles of the far right, the authors wonder.
More than one shows himself ready for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be smashed, migrants will have nothing but self-defense and armament."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"The internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network", writes "Selen".
What this means if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained well.
The picture of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here than there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of ourselves in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes the local population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many Germano-Turks has been toward the state of local law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time around.
The scandalous bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime patinated from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that in 2013 he would occupy almost as spectacular a position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss big bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recent solidity and made some kind remarks about future colleagues.
"UBS succeeded in the Turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And yet, by September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had diverted all of the Bank’s security systems and burned about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been regarded as suffering - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank as of February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At the same time, he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandalous bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on one side huge – until recently, it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been suffering from scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, saves such a proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from an easy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich says: “I have always taken UBS as a good banking model in front of my students.”
“From the current perspective, one wonders: how could I have simply been wrong at this point?”
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going around at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli surprisingly retired, who was previously regarded as an intellectual high as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, we realized why he had left.
The division of the bank had flared up with sub-prime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a crossover over it.
That’s why she actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point where we never even learned its name.
But it was only the first time.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank was again to announce billions of losses, and the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment mistakes, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank has bought tens of billions of problematic securities from the UBS, the Swiss Confederation has donated six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken up – because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We haven’t been able to save the UBS yet again,” said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had surrendered due to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy customer base, which had possibly defrauded the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital competing with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, within a few months the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would get out of it, it followed up with this unfortunate story of title traders: a single title dealer burns 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realizes that something was not going on.
And it is published: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, we found that risk management was too little changed,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and a professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control over risks."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their function, to become the guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too much risk, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank – it’s only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here among the Swiss traditional shops as well as those of the confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bench, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other thrown away from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he also does business with the two major banks.
The UBS would have become much too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would have spread further.
The Swiss have nothing to say about it.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the morals of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“This Wednesday the small country’s government coalition of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in their nation’s history,” wrote author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash.
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that have happened?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly as the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the little Switzerland - and has seen an ever-increasing growth.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS completed: a rich, but lethargic bank with asset management in Zurich as a strong point and a poorer, but certainly already more heavily internationalized one.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, former chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands it very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli until the end.
And Wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were reality,” Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the leaders’ meetings during which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of the banks at the time.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
However, the corporate advisors, who were responsible for it, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the larger banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Frightened by growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and passed on securities based on U.S. mortgages – but that has also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking to go down for a long time.
“Still in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there,” said Geiger, the bank’s expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and are bankable so far.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on the management of assets, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
Banking chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world on Thursday.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank broke up with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed itself: it must conduct the affairs of UBS sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It has cut 3,500 jobs.
But that's not going to be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He says publicly so far only that he and his wife were going to look for an apartment in Zurich.
The next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged U.S. investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Industrial production on the continent has suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in its germ.
General relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens was not imperative.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half filled last week, not half empty - but now the problems are pushing once again to the fore, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.

As announced by the Eurostat Statistical Office, the companies produced in September, 2% less than in the previous month.
U.S. investors have expressed themselves in a sceptical way: “We are not an island, on the other hand, dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: “It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early in his view to invest in bonds coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the wind and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of this traditional group, and allowed it to score almost more than 1%, against the trend of business management.

Intelligent corneas spread in cities
In many places, squirrels are considered a “bird problem” but experts say that these highly intelligent animals are no longer allowed to hunt cities for a long time.
Some like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Hornets have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying due to the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the “bird problem” is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch symposium on corneals, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt down the joys of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Protectors of nature also based the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected ferns: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional living spaces.
Hunting, planting and slaughtering typical swarming trees made life difficult for birds.
The corneas are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs of couverture in the Westfälische Soest, in the northwest, among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the corneal massacre in the region.
Critics found the birds caught in traps and killed them with particularly brutal gourds.
"Normal expulsion, eviction, is useless," said Werner Klöver, the city and landscape planner of Leer.
The destruction of the nests using water under pressure or cutting down the trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals move away, large colonies divide and disperse into other places.”
Evincing is imaginable only in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the eviction of animals with aversive packaging and attractive offers, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected “info panels instead of slicers” in order to establish completely different relationships with them: “We can finally better bear a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence.”
Jürgens co-founded the Asheberger-educational path of the crabs in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent crabs.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "Here is a great deal of communication, these birds have a lot to say about themselves".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: The freuds not only use instruments of work to arrive at a regal, but they make their own tools as instruments of work.
ethologists at the University of Cambridge tested four frequencies recently, how far the intelligence of birds is reaching.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crash a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to break down the platform.
In a second trial, the clever corneas were then to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers placed a small egg with a larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of iron wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four cheers were even successful from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo takes Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a coup by the Bosniaks and Turks remained unsuccessful.
Favourite Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal slammed against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the qualifying match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
There was also nothing more burning in the 0:0 null match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty played in hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the qualifying rounds for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Est<0xC3><0xA1>dio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters ahead in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shooting qualities at a distance and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosniaks, who in the first half-hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a head ball headed down the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark awarded an 11-meter penalty played in the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for the fifth time.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech blocked with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the shot of Cech.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the already shot world-class keeper of the Czechs, once again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench of the 2002 European Championship, the Croats were able to look forward to their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats left nothing to burn.
In addition to VfL Wolfsburg's Mario Mandzukic, who was replaced by Dortmund's Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.

Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment Estonia's defense was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first goalkeeper.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and would squeeze the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double its workforce in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” CEO Bill McDermott announced to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this expanding country.
China’s growth plans are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP expects to increase revenues to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, Walldorfer recorded revenues of almost 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
“Now, we want to expand our business (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information.”
The Massacre of Personal Mass
Peter Englund's new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," begins with a long list of characters that draw your heart.
A tip to get started: carefully tear this page and make it your page marker.
In this romantic tale of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a tag during these few moments where, as one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion of strategies and material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like," where you find the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, to doctors, ambulances and salesmen.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose their members, become mad, or lose their lives.
Their lives swirl here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are lit up.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It denies the idea that the First World War is summarized only by the terrible trenches war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully describes other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsé-tsé flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that blows the whirlwind.
When gunshots resound in the distance, and you’re a mother at home, do you stay or run away?
Who's gonna come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exaggerated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most deal with deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere Ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It continues on substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a false wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; soles of wooden shoes."
It states that "837 substitution meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitution coffees."
Some of the stories are about honor and courage.
An American civilian recognizes his own drive towards savagery and declares about war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey so much as a cigarette and a whiskey so much as a cigarette and a whiskey so much as your hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice, one hopes to have an audience,” he writes.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a convicted man strangled in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is increasingly becoming a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the livestock of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there is as much basic behavior as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in hopes of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund’s prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way the war has “triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "West Nothing Again", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came out of his book, grabbed this page with the list of people and burned with a lighter.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges to the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the department’s regulations and spawned a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of occupations in other cities.
A major exercise was organized on the island of Randall, with a view to the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are being better trained against riots — counter-terrorism measures that quickly move large numbers of police officers — to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the East River side of Manhattan.
Orders given to move into the park arrived "at the last minute," said one familiar, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
“The few police officers I know who were called didn’t know they were going to Zuccotti Park,” the person said.
"The only people who know they're going there are at the top of the police department's hierarchy."
The city was able to retain a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers familiar with particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that a lot of people were going to and coming to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages echoing speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers penetrated the park equipped with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tents were touched before 1h45, police said, leaving time for occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the measure had only been taken for security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was severely held back by the officers.
Browne said the television camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
As the police moved west across the demonstrators’ thick business excavation, including luggage, plastic lawn and sheet bags filled with clothes, sanitation department teams were following, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged and the images were released on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About a dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most for "disorder to public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detectives department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of policemen were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We've seen the police widen the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, would have even been seen pushing people away from them.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the bonnet of a police car and others were spotted digging tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union is suing the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school helpers who lost their jobs last month, plans to begin a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals, with disproportionate impact on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, 37th District Council, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school helpers, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the city's least paid, lost their jobs on October 7, the union leaders compared these dismissals to a political revenge for not allowing the city to have access to a budget for health care that was led by the groups.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied, stating that the school grant layoffs were not specified in any way in the budget.
The officers of the 37th District Council said they would fill out a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would be continued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to formally announce prosecutions to the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant. The plaintiffs will be represented by eight fired workers, all of black or of Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of redundancies in schools in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most refinancing due to one.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and just a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school assistants have lost their jobs in Brownsville’s 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aid workers at Harlem’s 36 Public School, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutions claim that “This is not a neighborhood of well-off parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap.”
The budget of the public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funding was also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "overrun" to describe the action, although "overrun" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, "sixty-six parental coordinators have been fired," and "not just because of exaggeration."
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the issue of Libya
It would eventually seem that the Republicans and Democrats have found an agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
A successful uprising would have taken place, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat-Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (American Independent-Connecticut) cheering for their "revolts" and applauding the Libyan people.
“This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“This is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But the same day that the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at reducing funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission thus remained in the form of a legislative purgatory – Congress angered enough to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his foot.
The indecision of the Congress has been surpassed by the events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgency in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure gain all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission, or will it divide legislators as last June?
Senator and Commission President Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but this is not without having tried.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a previous one.
There are at least 15 House versions of the amendment only for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - especially the new Republicans who want to gold their CV - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to raise the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetuated, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the states are opposed to it.
As eager as the members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
'Massacred but not beaten' Gabrielle Giffords says in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him to death in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared Monday night on a television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get back to Cong rather than return.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20" television newspaper, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show approached its difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first televised interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang – and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, responded "very well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special 20/20 hour edition, aired the day before the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope," was released.
The special broadcast traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved, and a wide scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated while awaiting trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Stop, stop, stop."
Upon her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, “I’ve been beaten.”
“So I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t beaten,’” said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're gonna get out of it, recover, and come back even stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for New York City’s homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie-up suit stood up at his feet to applaud him.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer present at the gala, in which Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of staff of the U.S. Army, also took part, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were presented as a kind of orphan,” the senior military official wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
Yeah, I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have built up between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some military officials say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for the men and women in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear unappreciative or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in confidence amongst veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were making him pass the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to sustain the blow under the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
“When you approach the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions,” recalls Colonel Cancian as he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are seldom welcomed by a country so unfamiliar with the military that sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faces Increasing Pressure to Squeeze Against Rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for an alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
She returned to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," Elizabeth Lyman said.
But Texan put aside his concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will anxiously await the court decision at a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and that will decide whether a trial of Donald Liefeld against the former secretary, presided over his defense Roberts.
The latter are accused of not stopping the spread of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. That number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been sexually raped or abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army provided atcie for justice, did not investigate.
Susan Burke declares to take care of the winged military, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The leaders."
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active-duty personnel.
"The alleged harm is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense has refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to combat, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only masculine.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women ' s military teams are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in contacting local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat.
It’s time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation is preparing a trial against the military, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary women's rights group, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Network.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way of dealing with claims of benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine separate bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants in the Susan Burke case described their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informs the military police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting in front of a judge, at a trial in which she is questioned about her sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, who ended up being acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was handed down,” Elizabeth Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander, 'It wasn't his trial, it was mine.'
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making her incapacitated to serve.
In January 2010, it was returned under less than honourable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Whether the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs will move forward or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he remarks, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence posed by responsibility.
“The odds are heavy against them... but it’s important that they try,” he adds.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, either one or the other of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being taken into a murderous insanity in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on the cyberspace: he had spent much of the time preceding the attack on his computer, chatting with a few million of the nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t “so hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS’ think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is packed with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific precision — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads themselves invited users to respond to their own inquiries. The questions posed were about their level.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, thanks to "Likes", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the “data supernova” generates an explosion in search, increasing the number of search jobs whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you might not be able to approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You should have gone to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,” says Jamie Bartlett.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits were much more likely to be alcoholic than discrete students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle-based Children’s Research Institute.
“We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise be unrecognized.”
Facebook is also constantly accessing the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics on Valentine's Day and Valentine's Day, the rate of participation in the midterm elections of 2010 and a national happiness index (thanks to the available information available only - the searchable data - the digital freedom champions have long maintained that its site could
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is everything else online.
“I don’t think a lot of users have ever thought about a researcher being able to study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students’ Facebook walls.
"As far as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
This is why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and of the Norwegian Templars,” he said in front of a 500-strong courtroom.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate from organizations that support an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I admit the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because "he did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, forbade him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
All took part in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
“I found it cold and inhumane,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television station NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made a bit of progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy, and he also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22 therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," a relative of the victim said.
"It would have been much easier."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview in Cinema This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in an interview with Steve Jobs recently found and which will be airing this week in the first part of a film about the major markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram improver - a man who believed that many business executives in particular were suffering from a "diseaseable job."
In 1995, Cringely was developing the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat down for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At the time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computing company NeXT, aiming for a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the major copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs' death that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This slightly overhauled video is the basis of the 68-minute movie Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be aired on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technology philosophies and its business strategies.
And unbelievably attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him elbows to speed up and move on to issues or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar, iPod, or iPhone era, we find a strangely prescient look on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here’s a quick summary of seven remarkable Lost Interview sequences:
About how he learned how to run a business:
“All these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are always the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Confused about how costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” assessed at the nose and then adjusted with a “variation” – he developed an automated factory that ensured accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack phone networks and phone for free over long distances.
The device has been the subject of many previous writings, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public telephone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while circumventing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and yelled at the public phone and it came to you a minute later on the public phone next door,” Jobs explains laughing.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't know much about both, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell a wonderful turn that he and Wozniak have set up: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go mad laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On her love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s take on it):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a wire.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a little cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was returned to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles down to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... they yelled at me saying it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Forty-nine days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that turned out to be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are suffocating:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Suppose you work at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copier or a better printer, and then?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are these types of people] who end up leading businesses and product-specialized staff are put away from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this position of monopoly is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product in relation to a bad product - the manual labor required.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They ripped away the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to do... Some things you can't do, the electrons can do it, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
That's partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health law opponents as the court meets
On the day that the Supreme Court meets in private to consider the issue of political discord, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will depose the co-defendant.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases concerned a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform voted by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental 5:30 p.m. argument is expected next March, and the result will likely be of a nature to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue against the rejection of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as the solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court's conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, top Republican in the Senate and declared opponent of the health law.
The guests are staring at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would doubtless argue by the Canon 4C Code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related organizations and others although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or featured on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the case's law firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, has sufficed to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have lawsuits in court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dismantles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for the critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Furthermore, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the level of the trial court.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing Registers Record Order of $18 Billion for Airline Planes
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777s, two-seater airliners, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
This, on the other hand, is quite a case when the airline in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally amazing is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that Middle East airlines will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 two-seater aircraft.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and convenience for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than a billion dollars.
“It’s clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
“These customers in particular have immense value.”
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore not only have the means to pay for these planes, but an increase in the price of fuel – usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs – would not be so detrimental to them as the country would make money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these airlines will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural risk coverage,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s dominance in the wholesale aircraft market and helps curb the Airbus competitor’s attempt to impede its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the Aeronautics Show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debuts of the larger version of the A350, which rivals directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its debuts to increase the momentum following its customers’ demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
The company’s shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President’s sister evidently defeated in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race to the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister appears to have lost her attempt to gain access to Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s governorship during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race to the post of governor of that western state.
"The intervention of the organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told radio in an interview on Monday following the election.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They seized polls, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until he lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out little from Calderon, who was at the forefront of polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother’s conservative Action Nationale Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any links to drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates locally resigned from the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections look, a victory will help the party in its rush.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly urges Asia to come to Eurozone aid
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the director-general of the Manila-based BASD, said the two fastest-growing economic powers in the world should “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would help to avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
“We are all in this crisis together.”
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but it is not safe."
“So if China and India can help, nothing can stop them.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy will return to recession, and has sparked a call from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would send any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power to Asia's partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a deterioration in foreign capital arrivals.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich in Europe as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day, or even less.
“One day, they will discover that the Greeks are retired at the age of 50 and that they are going on holiday in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to have “significant repercussions” across Asia.
BASD’s forecasts for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing “risk of loss” due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop emergency plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and major capital leaks.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defensive Reductions
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the civilian battlefields of the Lebanese invasion of Afghanistan.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more of compressions will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said Congress's failure to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called a seizure would result in 23% reductions as well as the freeze of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unexecutable – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or building – and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
“We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.”
The reductions would eventually affect combat troops, continues Panetta.
“Although the wartime financing of contingent operations accounts abroad is not directly affected by the seizure, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in basic budgets,” Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervising contracts that support the war."
"The salaries management staff would be reduced, resulting in payment delays to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a seizure of the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of the military power."
“We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta’s letter was published.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not what we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senatorial warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or call for the Pentagon to exempt from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself reached the Pentagon’s highest position accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what could happen — a soldier with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers able to complete the mission,” Panetta said in her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"Indeed, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage us in the world; and combatable opception of risks assumed in.
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cut, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal battleship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Find a Lie
A look at recent headlines shows how omnipresent deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was picked up by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and shaken countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, has passed for an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the coverage of an extramarital relationship.
And then, none of those who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on the tests of the school and the university are legion.
There have been instances where teachers gave test responses to students in order to be clearly seen on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected during the last six decades, especially in phylogenetic research projects in prestigious universities.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don’t blush, blush, or bother all the time.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include, in particular, hiring.
Good liars are capable of reading others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies "focused on themselves" while women tell more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people have to be "normal" than married people lie to their partners less often than married people.
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what is called "establishing benchmark data".
This helps to provide a point of reference for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves their feet constantly so as not to make unfair accusations when you see them move their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and non-verbal deceptive behavior.
Consider these indices as red flags, not proof of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, lean toward an exit, change post-interview significantly, or present a relief from "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all questions are not difficult.
Questionnaires often falsely indicate that the interview is finished just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject’s vocabulary.
Famous Scott Peterson has erased using the past while claiming his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use remote language: “I haven’t had sex with this woman...Ms. Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
One can use a lot of "wooden tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Will Be Distorted After U.S. Threat of Late Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the pipeline to the project.
TransCanada said on Monday evening it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada’s official, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential itineraries to avoid the areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogilla aquifer.
“It’s a real path forward,” Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to have pushed back any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny policy involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have put on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the oil pipeline.
But Nebraska's lawmakers opposed this plan are pushing a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a TransCanada-engaged lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was a Hillary Clinton campaign advisor in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the Disco diva Patti LaBelle launched in a wave of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the little 18-month-old Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of foreigners," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve were preparing to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk descended into the hall of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door and laid down her daughter for a moment.
“Someone came after me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and I went to get her,” she said.
LaBelle angered the pregnant woman.
“She told me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, 'What you say or think doesn't interest me.'
She got angry and started to use swear words - the word "" and the word "" with a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with bottled water.
She said that at this point, Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve became hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” said the child’s mother.
LaBelle threw herself at her mom — who was still holding Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms — and had to be held back by her neighbour who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud that she started to vomit, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but did not get any response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a cancer charity for children.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez's management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-called change, which has generated high expectations in terms of economic advances, but given the economic development indicative of the beginning of the year.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, limited the opportunities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the dynamic sector, which declined by 31.16 per cent in the second half of the year.
According to the report by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there have been damages of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent have suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent have suffered partial damage, the main crops have suffered partial damage.
As a result of the increase in the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, and the number of persons employed in the State, the number of persons employed in the State, was increased by the number of persons in the number of persons.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly based on the actions carried out by public policy.
"What is being observed is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to fight money laundering, because for people who earn dollars, it is not illegal to spend money on it, because for people who use it, it is easy to use it," he said.
Immigration Detained
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been limited, firstly because of the difficulty of entry and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market worsens by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and a lack of seriousness, another reason for shifting for the state are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of Sinaloese workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7,375 pesos.
IED contraction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economics from January to June, the State's FDI period in the same year reached $630,697, a year-on-year, down from $31,374, a year-on-year, from $14 million to $31,374.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, registered mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Let this
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State in July requested the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, with the aim of reactivating the economy, and the approval of the congress.
Reactions
For employers, the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés’ Government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has really been very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all and above all the best year is already synchronized."
Economic slowdown
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events like the frosts of the beginning of the year have held back the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, among which frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of e-flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below expectations.”
Re-define the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Federation of Patrons of the Republic of Sinaloa, said that we want to channel the state to more dynamic productive activities.
“In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we unleash the full potential of Sinaloa’s material and human resources,” he says.
Plenty to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channelled the Government's efforts.
“In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, there are some advances in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
“There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do,” he said.
Sentenced to 8 kilos of marijuana
A Novolato resident has been sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the convicted minor trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant possession of marijuana intended for sale.
In accordance with AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The little smuggler was driving in a white pick-up truck carrying a black bag in the vehicle’s trunk and a small backpack on the co-pilot’s square where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Center for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to Contributions to Works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished where to register serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that the total investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end they haven't given us anything, even though since July they had to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, we started the works and we've made a lot of progress, but we need it."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at the time.
“We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid,” he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates "analogous cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has sparked constitutional controversies that the Senate and House of Representatives have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogous cut" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed for the invalid have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television concrete.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been set aside for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that the regulation in the field of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the sub-committee principles.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also decided to bring about the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not believe that if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the direction of the State.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most significant changes the world has suffered in recent years and this translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Deferring change, he argued, would be deferring the benefits of digitalization that involves a decision of public interest that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, “require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in one form the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws enacted by the Legislature, he said.
The possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is analyzed
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor’s election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the first and the second place of the second round of the election of the governor is equal to 8 cents without the same number of seats.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards in federal reform.
It will be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not approve either his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the Congress of the State approved the reforms in the Journals shortly before the legal deadline had expired.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state’s envoy for constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” because he has no right to “sanction them.”
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the file of the Urne is not found in the President of the latter.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all elections of the election can be made if there is an indication that the difference between the supposed candidate winning the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the second place in the vote is equal to or below the initial signage of the party or the initial signage of the party that is expressed as a percentage point;
The total counting of the vote may also take place if, at the end of the common counting, it appears that the difference between the supposed winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there was the express petition of the representative of the political party to which the candidate came out second.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of driver Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Sierra.
After receiving tributes alongside other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant-colonel’s ashes arrived at the guard chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former tech baccalaureate colleagues and the American football team that Felipe Bacio was part of when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes spread in the Zapalinamé Sierra, he always said it <0x60><0x60>has his family and friends,'' said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considered that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared very much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n for his parent’s graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: piloting an airplane.
His Last Farewell
In honour of Salix, we said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute to which the Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, presented by the people and the Government of the State, Indi<0xC3><0xA8>re and the Mexican Army, Indi<0xC3><0xA8>re de la Mexi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all of whom were officials of the service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was waiting for other relatives by his family, including his daughter Cristina and his father.
Three bodies abandoned, located on the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots fired in different parts of the body and with the blow of grace, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who have passed through this place have observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him there was another one with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A meter away there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were stretched on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been killed in another place, because no in situ dolls were found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one group of organized delinquents towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to published information, in a first fact on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was rescued.
They were confiscated from three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed to be part of a criminal group called the Zetas.
In another event that took place on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel made a surveillance run at Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a loader and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are assigned clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the result of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The “framework is now well laid out,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels that cannot be sustained.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough package of austerity demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Emphasizing the pressure on Monti to speed up, the instability of the markets to place the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which was forced to resign last Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, the centre-right party's secretary, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure, noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will finish his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was about to resign, the costs of Italy’s debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the new prime minister’s success.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.9 trillion, would be too much for the Eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti said his government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections go ahead.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should only be formed by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that reciprocal mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is greater than that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened took part in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 pm, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, account for an extensive record of Class A inter-selection matches, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) against Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the Star League and in powerful Premier League clubs in England, maintain year-round intense activity in national league and cup championships and competitions in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we have to add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have limited international experience to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be of a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish national team is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolore and they will set a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, cerebral flyer of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenaries of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the forward of Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
The centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana, there is the left side J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 attendances and the goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var only has one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not starting yet.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
“Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality.”
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true in this country.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade-working celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
It makes me want to bring my music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity in the days before.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time has gone by until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have many friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's that for?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, which is why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people as well.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us had imagined we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very emotional.
We love each other and we love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't get better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in creating grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of big groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
“Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many bands normally last.
Firstly, I believe we are all lucky to be alive, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We’ve been a band for almost three years and we didn’t release a record before Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a lot of other stuff that I've been laughing at and I've been laughing at the amazing person that Andy's been faisa to me.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we’re looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
It is he who sings it and I believe he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge under control despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney now make the best music.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
That’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that qualify as very dark songs, although these may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs probably represent that to me.
I also think you can be happy and even like that you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he has in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including tongue cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of restitution for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times of tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been incarcerated since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official rallies, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations,” according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that prompted the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations with its ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s "grey list", which includes countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) that increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber moustache moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at everyone’s stores, was designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the head of the Spanish Nintendo press in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is " Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", as so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also implies the character’s return to a mobile console, which has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eye out to fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the plumber must traverse mined platforms of peril to free Princess Peach.
Even if I player finds novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom endorses Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer the United States for the conspiracy to whitewash $70 million.
Thus, the trial ends in order for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision complied with the independence of the judiciary and executive power, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term "he had not helped" in any court resolution and had given way to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done assumes an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional courts to judge the former term of office for the period 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted for diverting Q120 million funds to the Department of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Department of Public Affairs appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove are important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
In addition to this, the long century of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was held yesterday in an event celebrated in a former Fabra i Coats industrial complex, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are poorly trained, without work, with problems of addiction or marginalized.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu has brought together a large number of officials from entities and institutions that over the past 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the event the former Minister of Social Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor and current municipal eco-socialist councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the General Director of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The president gave Trinijov as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-partys, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the building’s 13 apartments, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street were living was over.
Twelve people voluntarily left at noon yesterday the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-partys that were desperate for the neighbors, by court order and without the need for a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From this day onwards there will be access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of that of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, its business fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property were making him unfairly competent, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the amusement park had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about the noise, while, according to the latter, the trouble was not caused by the guests of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the busy house and especially the participants at the parties organized there.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since the owner "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The chairman of the municipal group of the town hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had last week called for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of living together and civilisation that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be ruthless against antisocial behavior generated in property."
Yesterday, too, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already-defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orientate on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park other than Yellowstone, with bloodstains in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all the gates to Collserola.
A door reverts to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elected officials talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to "debate on the "mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green house plots has not been completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of these "as the access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that had in the Forum area "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, exceeding it.
“We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause genuine disasters.”
Referring more to the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the off-road that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that one has to create: "We, the architects, should be only one instrument".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title of this play is complex, because from the basis of the contest there is a lack of a comprehensive vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-sectional contests - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and this one will be released
After 72 days of interim arrest, Casino Red’s legal authority has granted forgiveness to Monterrey Mayor’s brother for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the legal power of Casino Red grants him a pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmailing the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the Royal Casino attack, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s allegedly demanded that he pay an economic fee for Monterrey’s mayor to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the mayor’s brother PANiste and on 2 September the mayor was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecution 3 Property Crime Agent, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued to him after the Public Prosecutor's Office had deflected the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center allegedly for having sung with one and a half million pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but he only spent a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jonas, such as the one relating to the payment of his house in cash of 1.5 million jeu de pesos.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom within the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor's Officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damage had been recovered and who of the gambling company's associates had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
In accordance with file 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is granted legal pardon and thereafter no complaints regarding the trial against him will be filed; no compensation or punishment will be sought from him.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to communicate to Jonas that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be classified.
He will also inform him of the immediate order of liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) has informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly against the ground and then forged it into complete structural integrity, without piloting it.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the plane took off, the pilot found that climatic conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements necessary to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations done in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In research, it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact was presented structurally.
“The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the Secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even take a year.
In turn, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services ensured that at the time of impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and this happened on an upward soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Full Visual:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Weather conditions:
Reports in the ICMA mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft progressed towards the adjacent area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-altitude clouds.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew sought a lower altitude area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the aircraft's last radar recording coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact took place on a straight and lateral path.
The model of dispersion of the aircraft remains makes it possible to assume that the helicopter has hit the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the place of the accident there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the ground had a slope that has been going for seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have dearticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough search in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find the Gene of Obesity
Social Security leads an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the protocol ‘Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescents’ that will have the markers associated with obesity.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Participants are invited to participate in the investigation and to attend the IMSS Sports Units in Valle de México, where minors are tested every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Sports Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After achieving the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this research and the e-knowledge of the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identifying risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays all participants will be applied to anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (they are trying to identify people associated with intileb).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez noted that this investigation is the result of health care professionals’ concern about the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there was a 77 percent increase in obesity in boys and 47 percent in girls; in terms of overweight, there was also a dramatic increase," said the IMSS specialist.
He pointed out that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which makes it possible to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
Ila even said that the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acanthoses) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measures and changes in lifestyle that they need to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay in front of the TV for most of the day and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another reason is the high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (sizes - meat paste to corn flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins in this protocol.
UNAM’s asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 cassis each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the pavement construction and maintenance process was completed, it would be rebuilt.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with high levels of mechanical resistance.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphalts, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give its carave.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of nearly 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, adding
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warns.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he said, is bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles pass through it by generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, it would spread better, according to chemical engineering.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one puts a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide grip in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the effort, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the layer it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes cassis.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first that breaks is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle loading is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the loading of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid the frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair the cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle’s candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her number 14 title of princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena (Catholic), Isabelle All<0xC3><0xA1>ntico (1989), Isabelle Alm<0xC3><0xA1>ntico (1989), Isabelle Alm<0xC3><0xA1>ntico (1989), Isabelle Alm<0xC3><0xA1>ntico (1989), Isabelle Alm<0xC3><0xA1>ntico (1989), Isabelle Alm<0xC3><0xA1>nt<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>nt<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>nt<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3>
Today, the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue that Colombi who co-port the Covarian, titles obtained by the Naliana queens.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she was not convinced with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why?" posed by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here’s the candidate’s answer to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it is a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is 'The Little Prince', it's a rather deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
This answer does not please firstly because of the term "culturalize" and secondly because it does not concretely explain how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched there is the one that Valle was destroyed by favorism.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the ovarian and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster's gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craftsman costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed that's not the queen's brilliance."
And this was noted in his first presentation in Hilton beach swimsuit and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Although she seemed confident of herself at the two parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN's "Como en casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was named a princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets the most awards during the contest does not receive the queen's crown".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in her country’s social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on her social sensitivity, that before the start of the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by her flaws in her back and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens trainer Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me had not been too notorious, left her points the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that Valle’s mistake was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“Surgery is good, but Valle didn’t know how to do it.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of that aspect.”
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest returns for the first time, after the swimsuit parade there was a cruel prediction that was accomplished last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo was giving to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopist has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a CTI typist from Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists working in the local offices of the ICC, this week was the turn of the “availability” of Elias Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in the municipalities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the friction skin, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who ran the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a pickup and a lantern, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the responsible who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n that yes, he was the Supreme Chief of the FARC.
In Search of the Imprint
For a Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali dactyloscopist, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinters support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false ID cards or do not have any documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher reported that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to draw a fingerprint from them, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the offender who had participated in different thefts,” he recalls.
Footprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently, a dead man was found, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be a suspect of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it places him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents are extracted."
When they appear, a picker or strip is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declining database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers," said the ITC expert.
He explained that not everything is how it is shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that one touches does not necessarily become a footprint.
It can be used, however, if the necessary confrontation is realized.
The “Vengeances” Defy the Authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters marched in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, Manhattan’s square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators rallied in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the ‘dignified’ to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesperson for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the "ungrateful" to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the "revengeers" occupied a new park at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and stopped some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, reassuring Efe that he had seen some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization says there are hundreds of people who had settled in the area, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the movement's members and tried to intervene in their behalf in front of the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which the legality of the evacuation this morning must be analyzed.
Some demonstrators who had been moved so far were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at the time and they were even handing it over to officers who were guarding the square, which caused “certain small clashes,” Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing “laws issued after the start of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the protesters, but warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the morning evacuation at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people", because "some shops had received threats" and the residents were "fearful of quality of life."
“This morning’s evacuation at dawn has been repulsive and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “disrespecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not plan to organise "large actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas program.
The private CTV channel announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crown" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, who portrays Jesus, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently featured a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas show also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a “whore” during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is recovering after the earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral in early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, Japan’s worst disaster since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo have estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have attenuated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, gross domestic product data between July and September served to turn the page permanently: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rates.
That recorded the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the true stimulus of the Japanese economy is based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, using the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the U.S. forecasting troubles, a privilege that weighs like a slate in exporting companies' accounts.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose line of economic buoyancy is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, accounted for their low performance between July and September for the yen’s contribution.
While markets continue to headquarter in the EU’s peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not take the lead.
“We need to follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s flooding and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that major powers are being held back.
Because it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even been below average, which is in level 100, dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens is fueling doubts again.
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty resettled in parks, Greece continues to meddle in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of Europe’s great debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday signaled that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his appointment will be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, re-emerged for new measures, ensured that he was not going to support them.
“The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit,” Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear any doubts about his position: “We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more.”
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of Papandreou’s referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid unless the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign “a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible”.
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika's inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no more definitive date.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain’s “preponderant” position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a predominant place at the global level in the role of Micro-finance".
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a, who hoped that the initiatives and inputs originating during the Summit, which will extend for the benefit of the most appropriate ones until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of the main new capacities.
We have “reached a lot of goals” and “we face a lot of challenges”.
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic objectives" must be promoted.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families come out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a stressed as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to observe a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty's family, whose relationship with the "Vald<0xC3><0xB4>" of the "Vald<0xC3><0xB4>" brought him yesterday the qualification of "the
Finally, Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, it stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez said that micro-credits entail “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradication of poverty,” and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to oppression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded from whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a "open city".
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but was imposed in the fall, especially to satisfy activists who judge the government's policy too lax with regard to the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Executive Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor - and of the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen EU control over the fiscal policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the motions adopted by the Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the pile is laid.
Similarly, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously returned to reinforcing the weight of Germany.
Concerned to appease the climate within her party, the chancellor multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she also did not seek to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty prompt to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the cave.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud mean in the case of medical arrests?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the disease arrests offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts with a willingness to save in a context of rigor, but is no less the announcer of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick stops.
First in a budget saving goal: the government is considering imposing a fourth day of deficiency on private employees before taking care of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is likely to provoke anger, but which would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of unencumbered deficiency in the event of a work stoppage (they so far have no deficiency period, against three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also raises the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The checks are going to be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will pay back," Xavier Bertrand told RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the advertising effects appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, this has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than anywhere else in Europe.
First, let’s look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this, 46% were for maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were for sick leave, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That is 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, French people experienced an average of 14.5 days of work stoppage, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some gaps: Another survey, published in 2007 by career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had never taken a day off illness.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to work stoppages than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick stop fraud represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small extent.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that checks on sick leave for more than 45 days are systematic.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 for short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled arrests of more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "unfit or unjustified", or 132,000.
In total, 169,000 cases were "unjustified", out of several million employees who had a medical condition.
A figure that represents very little face, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of fiscal deficit per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud in the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme in order to recover its economy.
That's what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said in front of parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said, giving his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the eurozone "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right-wing government rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, on Monday expressed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
It agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and the debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his repression was not enough.
euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalised, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, from a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
Introductory to the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death.”
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, in Québec, this rate is highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on people who are not competent or non-consent.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said in a teleconference yesterday that there would be more cases of these overflows in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legal.
“Euthanasie is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, respondents estimate 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or discontinuing care for a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made reservations about the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signatories to the report "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help in suicide,” said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
“In society,” he says, “there are signs and constraints.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly contests the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damas denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria Is Increasingly Isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Foreign Ministry’s premises yesterday.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia’s support, resists them and denounces a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, took a position in favour of President Assad’s departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “quite the power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces have still been killed.
“If Bashar was interested in his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is adopting an increasingly tough line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the regime’s actions” in Syria, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have died in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed “in exchanges of fire and pyramid on heavy machine guns in Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was “going towards the end of the crisis.”
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria “will not flex,” he added, assuring that “the plots against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression that he believes is locked in “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities subject to protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League’s decision was “incorrect” yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while retaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded some time from the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain “victims”, in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with the political parties yesterday before meeting with the unions and the bosses today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting with the designated Council President.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are specific deadlines” to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying “certainly the markets will be patient and understand.”
His appointment by the president had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The appointed prime minister should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislature, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti pledged, once he took office, to work urgently and with the aim of Italy "returning to protagonist" in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance goal in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new measures of rigor.
Italian boss Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit parameters."
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and a "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. NGO specializing in nuclear risk said on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA announced last week its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Oural), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cited "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system was "assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State of origin informed the Agency of this programmed technology, worked on its back-to-back technology for the most part of its life."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined or progressed slightly, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% overall increase in crimes and anti-crime.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” Human Rights First said, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long underlined that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the organization’s head of state.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, believing that this could go through improved police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a bit more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to more easily track, live, the activity of other "Twittos", the users whose messages are being followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they keep track of messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested “on a small percentage of users in August” before being broadcast across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, <0x23>followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to Google<0x2B> and the large public Facebook.
On the network, users were suddenly debating "tweets" about the interest of this innovation.
“It’s unnecessary, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” he wrote.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” said Dannykronstrom.
Austria-Hungary
registration of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of Austria's ruling Social Democratic/Christian-Democratic coalition decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any possible degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of the Atri.
It was Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the maximum 60% criterion laid down by the Treaty of Maastricht, but far below or below the debts of countries such as the Netherlands.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced by just one crane, from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay three billion euros more interest each year,” said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Eurozone member countries at the summit in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value by the end of 2012.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present budgets.
The objective is to move public debt to the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Yen Fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yens against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of force since 1945 against the green banknote.
But the yen has steadily risen since, doped by purchases from investors who consider it a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This fluctuation of the Japanese currency undermines the exports of the archipelago as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues from overseas by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Mr Noda said, who fears that this increase in the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of disaster-ridden households.
But the prime minister ruled that the value of the yen did not reflect “the economic fundamentals of Japan.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury vouchers by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros), raising to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the market cap on the amounts it spends on various financial purchases.
Euro area:
rates are rising, stock exchanges are falling
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock exchanges are sinking a little more into negative territory, on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gave up 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new strains on the yields of borrowing from eurozone states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
“Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering renewed fears from market players about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes set on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of fluctuations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she resigned after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that included the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6% <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and that of the Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is at the forefront of the markets, with the country holding legislative elections on Sunday.
The spread rate gap between Germany’s 10-year bonds and Spain has reached a new record high.
In anticipation of growth figures for the euro area
In terms of statistics, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
And it’s really the fourth thing that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and in the place of nuclear power.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will need to be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only the latest generation of power plants.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but themselves, are pursuing their plans with determination.
The U.S., they, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
Within a few months, all of these unpleasant effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Europe's champion of wind, of which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; under which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show principle opposition to this energy, polls show it.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has helped build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it drives a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very job-creating non-replaceable.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing as a skin of sorrow the 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to run for sixty years while its manufacturer’s decline would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no source of production of miracle electricity, no more than there is diabolical.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a Security Authority that exercises non-committal and transparent control over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, has intervened under normal operating conditions; it has remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians who want to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF leaving them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear power plant.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a debate as decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the tightening of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
To the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot welcome all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that one will be able to accord to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande cantoned on banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorate-paying; but it is economically very expensive.
As noted by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a wide consensus on this issue.
Restricting immigration anemies growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants are likely to replace national workers, especially the low-skilled, putting down pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, exercising most of the professions in sectors with a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have a hard time working in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the US Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (less revenues) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets on average over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, Europe's democracy remains to be thought
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him, who, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonists in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would suffice, for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
It is known, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become an “instrument of oppression” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis of the Europe we are living in is an economic crisis, but it is also, first and foremost, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum will have had in this regard a double revealing value: that of the need for a powerful return from politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and in dispersed order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a jump on foot in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - one would no longer know where to stop the census - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that adheres to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the piloting of the European project to popular sovereignty.
For together, Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After a long time fighting this proposal of the Socialists and of Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Yes, sir.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to “make” Republicans.
The revolution in the interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
Smart cards "contactless" are becoming more widespread
The world smart card show opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most portable segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or settle your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
For a long time in the wake of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the mouthpieces double.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the future of payment: the mobile phone.
Today, few devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to perform transactions.
"They've been late."
"But they should finally be experiencing a real boom next year."
“We are looking to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
Banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale, too, said yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is expanding
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further details.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January was reported to have brought to light the bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi's relatives, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their abductors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the debris of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
The analysis of past calls is aimed at several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“It’s a breakthrough, but we have to wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices increasingly complex and of the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illumined people of little interest.
A quick success.
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia while its activists engage in the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations.
Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, nuanced.
The army is invading the city, with 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Therefore, the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took over at the police's secure QG in a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Shebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information".
The World According to Republican Nominees for President
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplicity and ignorance.
Can a America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplying the toning statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unfounded - were used.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and challenge them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme in a America exasperated by the migration of entire pans of its industry to Asia.
As bad as that is supposed to involve triggering a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that flatters emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stagnating in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
In the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he said proudly.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, displays an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his anti-terror wine.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his distortions in Libya, thus sticking to him a label of weak.
But the attack isn't that easy.
Obama’s national security balance sheet, which eliminated bin Laden, was rather positive.
Since Iraq, it has been suspicious of military interventions that lead to depletion.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to revive its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia through the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline must be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be delivered, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same path.
For Gazprom, the timely and timely completion of this huge construction site has the air of victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will in fact make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
That is, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by providing its support to this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has triumphed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, heavily gas-consuming, and whose deposits are declining.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that ties us organically,” Fillon said in his inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-coiled steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, minefields dating back to the Second World War had to be avoided.
"One hundred had to be kidnapped or destroyed, by precaution," said Jens Müller, a spokesperson for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect the flora and fauna also had to be multiplied.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve, nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders gave up while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company permanently established off their coasts.
“In case of failure, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is deemed unlikely by manufacturers who have planned welding to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, wide by one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it delivers accurate information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty years renewable, the entire gas transport capacity.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided at 30% by shareholders and at 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to come back at their own expense, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour passing.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give back the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is in charge of launching the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of booklet was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought to the taste an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who became the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
The success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million expiration coins.
We are far from confidential production in the early years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its inception, counts almost 100 today and since 2008 has two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre and has been able to impose her identity.
“We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own booklet.
In August, she also released a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand stands out on a whole range of media.
An enviable success: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why Is the Unemployment Rate of Disabled Workers So High?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy established in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the general population.
Disheartening?
"No," says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people. "
"The progress made in the last 15 years is considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for the disabled, there are still many obstacles before they get to work.
They are quite old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and out of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, all of the criteria that make it difficult to return to employment, and that are "the node of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
This is for the objective brakes.
It remains the unsaid, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur for the City association indicated that the managers surveyed had “a low level of knowledge of disability”, with “over-representation of wheelchair users, mentally or intellectually disabled”.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures, dating from 2008, report a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of " taxed " establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Que du happiness"
Before meeting the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match provides them.
We won't go until we write that there was a coincidence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the estrade of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after his attacker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only praise to make about him.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," said the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the selection, "it's a whole, it's justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to take my marks."
Housed against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brilliant".
Not to mention the notion of “pleasure”.
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supportive,” he says.
Inevitably, this contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially in the face, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," rappelle-t-il.
"We've met just in time."
“To be able to play against them is only happiness.”
With bonhomie, Leekens, for his part, referred to "pride".
"Pritté" to contest "a gala match".
"Proud" also to note - as "voisin" - that France has "returned to a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc did a thunder job,” he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician will be able to share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You're going to realize it in the next games." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento’s Portugal starts with a lot of optimism his dam back against Bosnia (22h00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the same time, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao, which he has been in charge of since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unfold.
In view of the game going (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but he was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved him.
"It's a good result, but it carries some risk because we haven't scored a goal on the outside."
But at home, in their luminous Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the part obviously declares itself "very tight," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
The zero reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
No one can suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries some risk because we haven't scored a goal on the outside," said Bento.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order not to "give them time to think."
It’s a good idea, provided it’s realistic this time.
