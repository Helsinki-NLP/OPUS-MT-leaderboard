Right-wing populists win in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The perceived weakening of the two parties of the previous Grand Coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties resulted in the first preliminary results of the Austrian parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously damaged, suffered a particularly severe loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Federation for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the provincial governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the country’s strongest party, the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>), remains at 29.8 percent of the vote, but has lost 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which loses almost nine per cent of the vote with 25.6 per cent, was even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties in Austria’s post-war history, and the result is literally disastrous in the People’s Party, which has led to the early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition left, the People's Party had a significant advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>, according to public opinion polls.
The voters, however, were apparently penalized for allowing the government to fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation has been made about the possible resignation of party president Wilhelm Molterer and current chancellor.
The observers believe that this may already take place at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency on Monday.
This development is likely to facilitate the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP major coalition.
With regard to the consolidation of the two right-wing populist parties, the FP<0xC3><0x96> had already won 18 percent of the votes and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> had gained 11 percent of the votes, while the Social Democrats had gained 1 percent of the votes in 2005.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and I assume that he can return to Vienna for national policy, obviously counts on this solution.
The Green Party, which, however, lost some of its popularity and fell from third place to fifth place among Austrian political parties, also entered parliament.
None of the other parties crossed the four-percent threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India's relations could be frozen
If the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegally harvesting beetles could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there could be a certain level of confidence in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister announced this after meeting with Indian partner Pranab Mukherjee in New York today.
"If this didn't work out, then yes, there would be a certain amount of reluctance," he said after the meeting, which was held with Czech encouragement.
Mukherjee said after the trial that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, to which the case belongs.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
Then, against bail, he could ask for a release date and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had similarly expressed himself during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the top court, then it would be possible to release him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way to intervene in the entire case is to provide the convicted person with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said the Indian side was already providing them with such assistance.
"Our main interest in India is to maintain the best relations with many years of tradition.
The Indians recognize this as well,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a serious mistake to incarcerate and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
Asked whether the Indian side had been given a promise to deal with the matter, the minister omitted the answer.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
Czech Judges in the Battle for the Seabeds
Go to the wall electronic map, on which you can see Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point that disappears in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the neighboring seabeds.
The area is larger than the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the UN Division’s 30-member working group on ocean and maritime law.
His boss, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, a Czech lawyer, the director of the division, monitors the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
Unemployment and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seafloor is rich in natural resources, hiding a world barely known so far.
There are fossil oils, ores and other minerals, but so far also unknown living organisms, which may be key to the development of an anti-cancer drug, for example.
Sea surfaces larger than land surfaces
Today, coastal states are actively seeking new areas under the seas.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCCD) was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
First of all, it is the area of the so-called continental soil, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, such a country has the exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
“Simplifiedly, we keep the continental soil part of the seabed and the bottom layer, which is a natural continuation of the subsea continent.
The coastlines, often 200 nautical miles, extend beyond the border of the so-called economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission designating the external borders of the Continental Shelf shall be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The committee has so far discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” adds Mikulka.
Australia’s recent success in the world has sparked a resonance, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater country.
But New Zealand also won - the area of the seabed judged by the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, six times the area of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
Profits from the future use of seafloor will, in their hopes, be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly filing their applications.
They can do so within ten years of the ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental soil ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity" begins.
No country has an exclusive status here anymore.
The right of extraction in this field shall be determined by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says director Mikulka exaggerating by saying that "some areas of the sea are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined".
Czech Republic in the Pacific Ocean
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
This former eastern bloc is shared with other countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
Under the Convention, this organization was granted the status of a "pivot investor" in 1991, like some other investors in other countries.
It is licensed to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than that of the former Czechoslovakia.
The seafloor is divided there, it is a copy of the Tatras under the sea.
“A total of 75,000 square kilometers can be extracted.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic artefacts containing nickel, brass, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian division employee, presents another concrete example.
It reminds me of a potato or a little fantasy, a parchment with magic words that bring Golem to life.
German special forces were present at the release of hostages
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - and the specialists have come.
When the situation became serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details about the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also took part in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the aircraft of the German Federal Police, and the employees of the Federal Bureau of Crime, as well as the logistical experts of the German Technical Service, are also at the release site.
According to the ministry's spokespersons on Monday evening, German forces were not needed, however, as the hostages were allowed to run their prisoners and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage-taking.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to act as an on-the-spot support force.
"Unfortunately, this was not the case," a spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped groups of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were taken here and there on the border with Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The presence of hostages has remained unclear so far, as well as details of the release of hostages or possible ransom payments.
The survivors, meanwhile, arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release were not disclosed.
So far, no information has been provided in Berlin about when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the Airbus of the German Air Force.
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the bailout.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress has failed with a small majority in the proposed $700 billion bailout package for the money markets.
The Dow Jones is deep down.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the money markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite the calls of US President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, the program did not get a majority, with which they wanted to curb the chaos in the money markets.
Supporters desperately tried to convince critics during a dramatic campaign of the need for a $700-billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called on MPs to support the plan, even if it is unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
The Dow Jones fell by more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout package could be a failure.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, and then collapsed again after the failure was made public.
Experts are counting on further serious turbulence in the international money markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The directors are registering more and more bookings.
A good winter is promised to German tour operators.
According to a study, travel traffic for the coming months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ desire to travel was not slowed, according to the study.
With bookings for the winter season, travel agencies posted a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the previous year’s period, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to a study by the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings for the autumn months is already higher.
Travel agency traffic in October was around 11 percent higher than in October 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute has taken into account the trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar flow, travel to the U.S. was particularly sought, the DRV said.
Here, the rate of bookings increased by around one-third.
The Germans are also particularly popular destinations in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as their domestic landscapes.
Most of the organized roads were sought," said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Because of the rising energy and food costs, the cost of organized travel "is better calculated for passengers than for individually organized travel."
Passengers can save money with booking discounts, among other things, or with all-inclusive deals,” added Laepple.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so traffic growth can be reduced again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists made trips compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Repetitive ballermann drummers, literal corsair beers and design are celebrities wearing dirndlits.
Debut at Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really look very similar.
She's a blonde, TV show host, and she's wearing a tailored dirndling.
My hair is dark, I'm a student, and I bought my clothes in the turquoise.
However, one thing connects us: we are only three minutes away at Wiesn, the photographers are already grabbing us and filling us with their memory cards - very flattering, and all this on my first visit to Wiesn.
This is how we can make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndli fits his purpose.
As a tourist from Wiesn to the north of the equator made of white sausage, my comfort is still limited by popularism.
But with the arrival of Theresienwies, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears a dirt or leather pants; no one looks obsessive or tedious - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange looks at the chocolate-banana stand are only harvested by my dirndli tie.
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the fact that I have badly tied the rope: "You're free on a ball, you're a virgin, you're a right-handed widow, you're a back-handed widow."
In secret, I've crossed the mast from the back to the left.
"That's good," he says, and laughs.
Others have less sway around fine flirting techniques, and wear a simple felt coat with the caption "I'm too drunk to dress up" and uninvitedly show off their bare ass.
The young man with the exhibit features is called Bob, and he also visited the Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, lengthening the "aaaaa".
After all this, he tells me that he has been freed from the contents of his previously drunken corsage.
It's right next to one of the fire pits that everyone sees as their trash.
So Bob is one of the famous "tilos in the woods."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, the rescuers marched through the scene and took care of the poor birds.
The nurses always appear in a team - at the same time they wear a covered rag from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure up to the button.
You can't see who's lying in the liquor bag under the pontoon.
"They're the ones who're completely ready," one of the sanitizers yelled at me for my question, and then turned around.
Police Name the Victim of the Accident
Police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
A resident of Brentwood, Chelmsford Road, and Carole Paulson were involved in an accident on Shenfield Road in the city on Friday afternoon.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Rumford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
Since then, he has been released on bail.
Turkey's Expanding Diplomatic Horizon
Shortly before Turkey had intended to join the European Union, the European powers were burning away from the desire to penetrate deep into the Turkish backcountry.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, lies one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel books say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, with one tower at each front corner, and looks like some sort of German rural townhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little messed up.
However, looking at the interior of the ticket office, it is obvious what a large-scale enterprise this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, the "late future" of conquests, has sought to achieve its ambitions of occupying the Middle East with the help of this railroad from Damascus through Baghdad to present-day Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by the Arabs Lawrence and the Arab partisans.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station wasn't any better.
In 1917, an ammunition delivery train exploded and destroyed the beautifully designed top of the building.
According to Turkish sources, a sabotage operation took place.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, and history has gone a long way.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, at least in a symbolic sense, Turkey serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon.
The Justice and Development Party in the government - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded a night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts in the AKP, the Turkish parliamentarian Suat Kinikiklioglut.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of silence, which at the time gave the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail" - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new, world state.
However, the AKP, which has a well-known Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has raised some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specifically designed for this purpose - which is located in a developing suburban area, half-ready between shopping malls and coffee houses. The latter will meet in the rainforests - in the middle of a suit.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have joined a right-centered politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a jacket, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy objective is to help Turkey re-integrate into its immediate environment.
“The Cold War has disrupted order,” he said.
Isolated from the back of Turkey.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
It had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that he will be forced to vote sooner or later?" I asked.
"Turkey has never wanted to face a road."
He then underlined what almost everyone I spoke with here almost mechanically repeated: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea are of the same benefit to Europe and the United States.
It is as if they want to convey the message that, in a sense, together with Turkey, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those railways to the east.
When I was once again at Hydarpasha station, after another night spent mostly awake, I was thinking of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who, a hundred years ago, underwent the construction of this ornamental building.
They would have been surprised to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back across the Bosporus, I remembered that at that time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
At least at that time, there was no question of which continent would be in need of this exciting country.
Memories of Life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as Guildford Music Director, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, Sept. 11) has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the city district, he founded the following year a wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
In principle, only 21-year-olds could have been part of the choir, but when Proteus sang the finale in 1979 - many of us were already in our late 20s - we simply weren't willing to get rid of the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological variable) was in keeping with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any coffin they face - be it with the madrigal or a piece of Messiah; without accompaniment, or with great music.
The musical versatility of such a young choir has often been astonishing and always exciting, and we were able to thank the man whose inspiration has kept our passion for music unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
“Sing it up!”
His karma technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or excessive.
No matter what his musical level was, he was always on top of it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If there ever was a leader who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well in the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty-one years, I have written criticisms of more than 100 of his concerts, but I have never been disappointed by any of them, and I have often excited about them.
Tod Handley had both greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated those leaders who - living in his words - simply "galopped through the whole world with one or two well-known fighters."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your necrologist William Woodruff (September 25), "in 1946 he continued his studies of economic history in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a Fellow of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was continually preparing for his undergraduate, master's degree and Ph.D.
This comes from Woodruff's author's notes on "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and under the guidance of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British tyre industry, which he later published in 1958 under the title "The British tyre industry".
In 1950-51 he actually resided in the United States with a Houblon-Norman Scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff made this period of his career more beautiful.
J. Vicente Resino on the Wizarding Armor
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are impressive.
The simplicity and power that flowed from them, as well as respect for the people in the photographs, have attracted my attention.
This exhibition is influenced by the emotions.
Resino has come to capture the magical moments."
Second time sales record at Honda <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of Jazz.
True, its predecessor already had a large enough passenger compartment, but the design of the interior of the new model is even wider.
All of this is coupled with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel-saving.
Evolution versus Revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although it is very similar to its predecessor in the new Jazz scene, many internal changes have been made to it.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move on to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz came out six years after the first generation was launched.
So, for the first time, we can conclude that Honda has been able to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is less well-known, but it sets sales records in other markets.
In Japan, for example, Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces of jazz have been sold since its introduction to the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the area with the new Jazz.
While in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 it is estimated that it will sell 100,000 cars, resulting in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz units on the Spanish market, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary are estimated to have sold 2,000 copies during the one-year run.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda’s Spanish sales.
Representatives of the company are forecasting 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than the 2007 figures, or a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.8% from 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this with the introduction of a new model.
It would be the Insight, a five-door and compact-sized hybrid – 4,370 mm long – of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the market share of Insight would be shared by the United States, while the remaining share would be shared between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight after the official presentation in Valencia, scheduled for January, is due in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become broader in every respect.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width 1690 mm (two centimeters wider), and its wheelbase has increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height, on the other hand, remains unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment was also wider.
The larger interior is guaranteed on the one hand by the new body, and on the other hand by the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total storage capacity of the so-called double-floor luggage rack has grown, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the fact that these dimensions apply to the type with the 1.4 engine, since the 1.2 Honda Jazz is a 379-litre container.
Some external modifications can also be detected, such as the rear downlights or the optional panorama glass ceiling, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors for the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation Jazz engines are also new.
At the start of the sale, this small model can be ordered with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre engines.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, both power consumption is more favourable than the previous model, as well as lower carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coherence, while at the same time the engine delivers high performance in all respects.
The 1.2-litre power supply is 90 hp at 6000 rpm and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100-horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The collision-avoidant "mergrowth"
For the development of accident-prevention technologies, this time Nissan has been inspired by nature, precisely the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that will avoid accidents by mimicking the bee’s bark.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center, in collaboration with the renowned Advanced Scientific and Technological Research Center at the University of Tokyo, built this small robot in Japan.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research Development, the BR23C is a further extension of Nissan’s four-level safety case.
The robot makes the company’s products more fully capable of collision avoidance.
During flight, each uterus forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
More important, however, is the role of the complex eye of the uterus, with which it sees at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions. Consequently, the uterus can fly smoothly in its own personal space.
To replicate the function of a complex eye, the engineers designed a so-called laser range finder (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument detects obstacles within a range of up to 2 metres in a 180-degree field of view before the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into a collision avoidance operation.
“As the obstruction is detected, the small robot immediately changes direction by imitating the movements of the uterus by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision.
The system is most distinguished from the instruments currently available, in which case the avoiding maneuver takes place completely automatically.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the circumventing manoeuvre cannot be directed upwards or downwards or transversely, it can only move in two dimensions and only in the direction of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and in the way that occurs in the case of bees.
That’s why Nissan used a rotational function in the robot in addition to acceleration and deceleration to avoid collisions.
“This structure only needs to process the data every few seconds and respond to it.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
It may sound surprising, but it’s not really gigabytes, but we’re not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan’s estimates, can be incorporated into mass-produced cars within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, it may be an additional application option to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to get the car to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Afraid of the mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department has a lot of cash to invest, and there is no shortage of common sense.
With the crisis at their necks and the Americans avoiding being wrapped up in the path of questionable mortgage banks, they have created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's the "Bad Loans Hotel"... that's to the gulags.
The accommodation, and especially the image of the front desk comb, suggests that we think once, twice, and even more, three times, is it really time for a loan?
And most importantly, where we need credit, because that's probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is really useful, but not in much detail.
It's more for young people than for the general public.
What would happen if we supplemented the game?
For example, in the hotel you will see the room of our dreams.

Morgan Stanley Opens Its Capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a shareholding in its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). Japan’s largest bank pays $9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after Morgan Stanley’s share price fluctuates.
A week after the preliminary deal was made public, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion in total.
The accepted price will be deducted by more than 19% from the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which provide a yield of 10%, and a conversion rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average exchange rate of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock price fell by 6.79% at around 17 o’clock in Greenwich, closing at $23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transformation into a banking holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group of Companies.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which allows him to diversify his activities, but at the same time comes under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG confirms once again that the current financial crisis calls for even greater caution from the companies listed on Wall Street.
The terms announced on Monday also show that the deal has been changed in recent days: Last Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell 20 percent of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought the stake would be entirely tribal,” said Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s managing director in Tokyo.
However, due to the current market and economic situation, we would have wanted to minimize and avoid possible risks.”
With regard to the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the yield per share is reduced by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into stocks within one year if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a given period, i.e. approximately 47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that you can leverage your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet, and increase your liquidity resources with the help of funds from MUFG.
However, the group spokesperson did not wish to provide precise information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the merger of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by around 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said his balance sheet had improved “definitely” since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a big test for the group, as the exchange rate of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of insurance against non-payment risk has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
One more "survivor" of the major investment banks remained after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, who announced last week that it had reached $15 billion from its parent company at Warway.
Statement by Rafael Correa on Monday, Quito
Reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is a joint plan for Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Corre.
Following the pattern of his colleagues and friends on Sunday, Correa expressed his ideas about the new constitution.
He successfully fulfilled his mandate, as 64% of the voters voted yes in the referendum according to the official results, which were for 80% of the votes.
According to the poll, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the votes were cast incompletely.
A 50% <0x2B> 1 vote was required to pass the draft constitution.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a count by a civil society organization proved to be a huge "yes" vote with 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had already spoken about the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The constitution has won an astounding victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadorians at the governor's headquarters in Guayaquil, 280 km southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa congratulated Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the Observer Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. The main theme was a 444-point text that summarized the principles of the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, while preserving the state’s right to “plan for development” for a country that lives essentially on oil production by foreign companies and the currency sent by immigrants.
Correa's draft constitution, elected in 2006, also confirms the power of the head of state, who can obtain a mandate for up to two consecutive terms and is entitled to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced that he wants to live with this opportunity, and in February 2009 he will again compete for the head of state.
By the way, the constitution included free health services and education. The president has already begun the introduction of this in a country with a population of 13.9 million and half of the population lives below the minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the Quito-Washington agreement on the use of the Ecuadorian facility as a basis for U.S. anti-drug measures.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commander attacked the kidnappers, who held eleven tourists and eight of their companions hostage for ten days.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained for ten days in the desert, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in the morning by an Egyptian commander in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, around four o'clock in the afternoon, they arrived by plane at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were barred from reporting to the press and immediately transported to a hospital in the suburbs of Maadi, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers "did not pay a ransom," Egypt's tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were taken hostage on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in a field safari, after which the group was dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hostages.
The group consisted of 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), and eight Egyptian tourists: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian travel agency that organizes the safari.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a special commando of 30 members arrived on two helicopters at the site, where they were attacked on the hostage base just before a flood.
"There was a fire between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, and the others fled," the leader said.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they were joined by German and Italian commanders.
The Italian diplomat Franco Frattini, who is currently based in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We have to recognize that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service personnel and action groups," he said, without further details.
He also denied that the hostages had been paid a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army announced that it had arrested a field vehicle on which the kidnappers traveled, killing six of them (including the Chadian leader) and arresting two.
According to the army, the hostages were linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organization immediately denied.
Lettres - The "silent majority" of culture
At the heart of the news and the ongoing election campaign is currently a debate on the financing of culture.
We can only enjoy it.
But they continue to forget about a fragment of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to shed light on the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national historical monuments that are on the brink of starvation?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that it does not care about its monuments and the buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Québec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
The Constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by every citizen, every elected representative, and every governmental body.
Within the framework of the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40,000 volunteers working in the field of history, cultural heritage, and genealogy are involved in the research of history, as well as of a large number of volunteers.
Often these organizations defend our heritage with a tooth-ring, and protest with the last force of the drowning when property developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of the historical and cultural heritage?
Fortis Bank to be Stated Part of the Benelux Governments
The Benelux countries are assisting with partial nationalisation of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, which, as the first European, was in trouble due to the ring effect of the US credit market crisis, with a total of 11.2 billion euros in support of the three countries.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level on the matter at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, the Fortis bank is the first major crisis in the waves in the context of the international money market crisis that has been ringing for more than a year, and decisions on the bank can therefore be considered to be unprecedented in some respects.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, almost half (49 percent) of all three states buy the bank’s existing assets.
The bank certainly sells some of its interests, including, above all, the activities it bought from ABN Amr<0xC3><0xB3> from the Netherlands last year - mainly its insurance companies.
Fortis' stocks began to fall steeply last week, with serious crisis events at the institute in the second half of the week.
Analysts agree, however, that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s paperwork fell by about 12 percent on Friday only to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
In terms of current share prices, the total market capital of the group is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to the company managers.
The company’s management, meanwhile, blamed overseas market uncertainties over the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package plan for the collapse of Fortis stocks.
By Monday, the paperwork had gone up a little.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx appointed a new CEO at the head of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has applied for a worthy offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, they do not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and the accounts have not been shaken.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and has also acquired leasing companies.
Cancer in the chicken coop
In the U.S., life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with the applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that links the use of pharmacovigilance data to the consent of the data subject in all cases.
This has to be in an independent hands, otherwise we'll entrust the fox to chicken science," said Richard Dicket, the developer of the program to monitor drug referrals.
The insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount involved in the event of damages dependent on the health status of the applicant client, and if they consider the risk too high, they do not even insure it.
In the past, the person was sent for medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the outcome of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: from pharmacies, the customer’s identification number makes it easy to find out what medications he has bought in the last year and a half, and from this program he concludes himself as to what kind of disease he is suffering from and what kind of disease he is suffering from.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol-lowering agent, it indicates that your blood fat levels are virtually untreatable, which immediately falls into the higher-risk category.
Several versions of the programme are also in circulation, some of which also define a risk multiplier number, so the insurer will have little to do besides paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
Disadvantages include that some medications can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered to be a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the former not.
Separate companies have been formed to collect and process the data, and they ask for the patient’s consent before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to the data on drug consumption, so that they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies are accessing the data, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to control the usage.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it applies only to health care providers and insurers.
In front of the Congress is the bill, which also gives powers of control over companies specializing in reporting to the authorities.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: therefore he has developed his programme, which would involve the transmission of the data with the express consent of the data subject.
Another issue is that the person concerned may not be able to deny the consent, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
So, to some extent, the chickens are referred to as the goodwill of the fox.

The European Union and India are doubling their trade
As the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the agenda of the Ninth Summit was dominated by this topic, along with the other, largely global problems.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear cooperation will mainly be discussed.
While the European Union recognises that India is a rising democratic power that should be given more input into international affairs, the Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator, should they support the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council in New Delhi?
This issue has not been raised in this way at the 9th summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the European Union, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana have welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they have agreed to double the number of members of the European Parliament in five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a result, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions existing in India have been juridically merged, i.e., air traffic could also be swayed in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India’s number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the EU’s partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, were condemned by both sides in all forms and urged the convening of the United Nations Conference.
They also pushed for the completion of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large part in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to a sustainable energy and climate programme, i.e. to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at next year’s climate conference and to moderate greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent an increase in food prices, and they supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister is heading to the French capital today, where a bilateral meeting is set to start a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that the construction of Indian nuclear reactors will be commissioned by French companies worth twenty billion euros.
According to the news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, at the 60th Buchmesse.
7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries are expected to attend this year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair, on a 171,790-square-foot base area, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State for the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square meters through the establishment of a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference at the "Room Struktur" hall of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, which will also provide an opportunity to present information, trends and perspectives on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is steadily decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's missing a year ago
The remains of billionaire Steve Fossett's plane were found missing on September 3, 2007, over the Nevada desert.
The debris was found on a 3,000-meter high plateau in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found on the inside of the plane.
John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, said: “After we have determined the position of the plane, we have sent a team and now we can be sure that it is the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance.”
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreck was discovered, they had asked a committee of investigators to identify the plane and find out what was actually the case with the Bellanca 8kcab on the day of September 3, 2007.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near the home of Mammoth Lakes.
Two ID cards named Fosset, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Authority, some cash, and a sweater.
His search for Fossett was abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks through which he has entered history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a ball of air: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he also flew around the ground without landing.
Among his many records is the flight over the Andes, at 15,445 meters altitude, carried out by a secondary pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, but at the same time original and definite form of hobbit space, with large surfaces and cleared corners.
In a nutshell, Mercedes-Benz’s latest “compact SUV” has been trying to bring fresh momentum to the market.
That’s why the introductory campaign of the SUV GLK in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms will be surprising and unusual as of October 17th.
In fact, the advertising campaign that accompanies the introduction of the new vehicle lives with a media communication tool hitherto unknown, including through utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by a car brand in Italy.
The giant poster action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the introduction of the space-efficient car, in which the new SUV, shared around the Corso Como, will be visible in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer of the picture will feel as if the car stands out from the poster.
Subsequently, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK is visible individually and then combined into a single image.
Undoubtedly, with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the advertising world of the automotive stereotype.
Will this be able to arouse the interest of future customers? We'll see.
We'll show you who the Italian football players are.
Triveneto youths, they're likely to be banned from the track.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of the whole of Italy? Members of the group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the selection for years, and which, in fact, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never clashed with the opponent's fans.
The group's core is on the right.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined in Sofia by smaller divisive groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags were hoisted on which the supporters' hometown was displayed: they were removed on Saturday so they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi supporters team, the Levski printers.
The Italian Football Association has issued 144 tickets to the Italian fans. These were tickets for the name, so it is easier to check the team of the fans.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: among those who were preparing for Sofia there was no one against whom proceedings would be in progress, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans, who have a football-related prius, have refused the ticket and the trip.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior is waiting for the protocols coming from the Sofia police, then taking the necessary measures: those supporters who were arrested or identified during the riots can be hit with a five-year ban.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to visits to Italian stadiums, but also to all European stadiums.
So our football fans can't put their feet on any football field.
Luckily.
But we must also fear that the Huligans will find followers, that is, that for just under a hundred and fifty people, others will join in.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, it must not be liberated from anyone who behaves in this way," the Interior Ministry said.
So it’s better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday’s match day is coming up in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports the Italian wolves.
The Observer Service will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday the Committee on the Analysis of the Security of Sports Events, which can also count on one of the departments of the Internal Security Service, on the secret services dealing with the behaviour of the followers.
"Duce-Duce scandal and a booming arm under the Italian anthem? Not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This idea was coined in a rather unfortunate way by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago as the head of the Ministry of the Interior’s observatory (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente, and earlier by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims is true is not forbidden in Bulgaria to live the Duc, but as a result, the behavior of that 150-200 followers was shameful.
I am not a sociologist, he added, the first man in the surveillance service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime was committed.
So far, this group has not caused any trouble. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let’s talk a little bit about chanting the Italian anthem: it’s not a crime, but, if I may say so, it’s not called well-being.”
