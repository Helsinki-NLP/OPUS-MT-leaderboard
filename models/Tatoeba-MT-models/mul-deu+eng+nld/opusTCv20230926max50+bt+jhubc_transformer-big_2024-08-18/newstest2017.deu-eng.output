28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall.
The victim’s brother said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, “Finally, he went up again.”
The body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the forensic department in San Francisco said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS transmitter KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had his dream job as a chef six months ago at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the son & daughter said she was "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
“We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully,” the spokesperson continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook us something, to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of discussion.
He was the brother who swam with the current.
“With everything that went wrong in the world, it was this uncut diamond that shone bright every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD’s referral phone at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made that clear in an interview.
“I’m always stuck in drawers or getting glued from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and reality.”
“I don’t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, I'm pretty shy about these things."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about being considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dut and Mexican food, the magazine says.
To white glute, she brings the question of the desire for children: “We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” the Hollywood star said.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some of his colleagues were looking for a little change with an exit to the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday evening, they hunted home to the feeding troughs in a quick gallop.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer said.
And so the horse racing career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany’s best golfer of all time – 101 tournament victories – was again close to horses.
He was led with his family over the ALRV plant, on a horse he did not even wave for photographic purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.
There is no shortage of awards for the friendly athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already honored him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” Langer says, “because it will be awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment.”
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sport" on Saturday.
The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wühler und the Handhlenba Wienecke.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer distanced himself from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump’s economic policy in comparison: It’s all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – that’s what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a principled issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it rather small in doubt and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
It would be very different, Trump said.
He will massively reverse regulations, and he is strong in favor of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up, and it needs money to do so.
That’s why taxes would be raised for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
In which to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost the same thing.
The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical party wings of Republicans, for example.
So there could still be party-internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and raise coal production in the United States again.
Oil production should also be possible in protected areas so far, he wants to announce the Paris Agreement on Climate Protection.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program, and demands: “A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
"It's going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in terms of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign.
At the same time, however, the US does not want to isolate itself from international trade – it just wants to protect American jobs better.
They should also be paid better, for example, by Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: Once he says: the minimum wage must be raised, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the major discussion in the coming months is likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics say that this would only make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, is saying that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers shelter.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is at least one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stared at the table.
Until she realizes that she is being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the business manager of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the northern part of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight,” Bahr says.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls,” she says.
There are other reasons for fleeing: “Many steal secretly from it because they see no other way out.”
In their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, coercion, honor killing, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
On the run, it goes on.
“The fact that a tug for a bottle of water demands a sexual act, for example, is not a rarity,” says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that the end when they arrive in Germany is wrong, Bahr says.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often seen as inferior and at worst abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of women living in accommodation in Munich’s north are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children probably didn't come up voluntarily."
Many women are so used to it that they say nothing.
“Or they don’t trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great.”
Since they often don’t know how to help themselves, more accommodation is needed just for them, Bahr says.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for hosting refugees.
When asked if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some answered with no.
In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
Even in Swabia alone, women refugees are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a government spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or private houses for single women and their children only in some communal accommodation.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"If privacy is lacking or men and women are being accommodated together, violence against women may be too - more persistent".
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, says the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be seen in the Andrang, which exists on the house in Munich.
“Since we’ve been around, we’ve had a long waiting list,” says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: Demands for new labour-fighting measures
Deputy assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour-fighting measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more labour-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said it had failed to address ministerial concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "perseverely calm" to problems, leading to the treaty being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and called for official renegotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board of Directors today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour campaign measures beginning in early September.
The dispute led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total outages in the NHS’s history.
The head of the BMA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the sessions, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: an “alliance of externals”?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand themselves over and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But a radiant, sustainable refrigeration from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launch of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was outraged.
Putin issued a statement and accused Ankara of sliding Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding the trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations by top officials that Erdogan’s own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently disputed this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have shocked him as well.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard — particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season storm on the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, state television forecasted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West as its reaction to the attempted takeover of power is seen as a weak response.
In addition, there is the ongoing turmoil over the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is pinned on benefiting from the cool mood and reducing Turkey’s relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for asking for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup d’état.
This is clearly a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this shiny seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described to me, to present an “alliance of outsiders”: two countries that are broken and badly treated by the West and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents stated at the press conference that they had not even discussed the issue.
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator for Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better for the two heads of state to talk to each other at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is to be reduced to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategies have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private-customer business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand our employees will be engaged in as we become more of a bank of brands now."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to evolve into a bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we’ve asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori wins 3,000th at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000 profits
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He bet on Predilection, coached by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I’m very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the cheer when he wins on Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race – Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner, had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it’s no surprise that he’s reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been enthusiastic to fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already made 6,000 wins if he wasn’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a vivid personality, which is good for a British race, but besides that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A number of grand tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he was initially in trouble when he returned from his six-month lockdown, but he showed impressive character strength to withstand his doubts and return to his best form.
And he’s not at the end yet – Dettori has previously said that he wants to continue competing until he’s at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of confidence.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a statement, the Kremlin said that without giving reasons, Putin "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin’s website it is stated (in Russian) that he was later the head of the protocol and chief of staff of the government staff.
On his appointment, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State regarding bills and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV channel on Friday that he had asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince you?
This move has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works as he does for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows that at the moment.
But the official claim – that a man who was once lauded as a potential president suddenly wanted to lead Russia’s environmental policy – came to great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, “It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post – one could almost say – difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took over the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once believed that after Putin’s second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, since a third term of Putin would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken over by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical fight last month at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, will be released at a later date, according to the statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have been putting all my heart's blood into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is set for September 28th.
Mystery of Fish Landing in Garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandals that were spied out by a spring well.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "deck fans" that approach completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The Fife bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to an engineering of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete punch for the deck today in Rosyth, which means the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first lock represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the closure represents future-proof high- and low-rise construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the Nordturm deck under construction, we had to close the gaps on the north or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern Zubringer bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team was working on were small - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Luckily, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim safely as their boat continued to move on its own.
"We saw the boat spin around her and imagined the worst," said Moelfre's head of rescue station Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already pushed the boat out of reach until we let it go to the water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boje without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: “The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stopper, this disconnected itself from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was being kenned.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Seriously hurt - Man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
Police said the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut off his ex-girlfriend’s clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he hit her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her life partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
However, she could not move him to leave the apartment.
That’s why she left the house with her life partner.
On the street, they met the man’s ex-girlfriend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken into account much more strongly in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 affordable apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes a "concept of action housing" for the next Council meeting.
But the dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who is going to build the cheap apartments?
There is no regulation so far.
Christoph Bratmann, SPD Group Chairman, said: “We agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future.”
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in stock.
However, the big point of contention in the town hall is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing.”
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is designed to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the factions at the moment."
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.
The left wants tougher demands for investors.
However, according to Bratmann, the situation in the housing market is exacerbated.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
However, the program is still not complete: because the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1,300 affordable apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?
By 2020, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent that, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring bonds should now be purchased by the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back into the price range.
This is possible in the western city.
In one stroke, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city there are deadlines for the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price range for affordable apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies, don’t want that.
Because the number of social housing in the western city is again dramatically increased, one distances oneself from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of socially vulnerable people in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, chairman of the group, said: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on the boat."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
However, this does not mean that no compromise can be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It’s fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games, and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand dropped somewhat in early July.
Market introduction in other countries has been postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “captured.”
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person lays back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently reported that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people tracked who train 30 minutes every day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement.
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to “take 30 minutes,” “come from the couch,” and “be active every day” stumbled upon deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sports cannot be overestimated.
People who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to include here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that is fun for them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also mysterious game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's that?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will slow down over time.
However, thanks to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles makes gold in the women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the bar.
Stunning on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American tournament clinched the multi-fight title on Thursday and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the floating beam during the women’s singles competition in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended in that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport over the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals—including 10 gold medals—with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton saw of her said she "has been the best tournament ever."
She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women’s singles event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted, during her long journey to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true.
Part of her ground exercises – which include her typical tumbling pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit into her home on the street outside the Rio Olympics.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym, in which Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more multi-competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina easily led by two turns, the image cheated.
Floating beams and ground towers - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were lauded.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another one on with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman gently embraced her as they waited for her final touch – a pure formality – and tears flowed on Bile’s shiny red, white, and blue eyeliners as the vision she once described in her book of collections became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time she fought for third place four years ago, but the bronze medal in a tiebreak went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she gave the audience kissing hands, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, the 19-year-old’s fast-growing tweet from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims killed in serial murder while listening to music in car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder case while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report reads.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the assailant did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Police Spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of a house,” Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, targeting an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-time murder and assuming it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge casings and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't allow myself to do that.
Which isn't right at all -- of course you've let it go," she said.
Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund would never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
"My first response to that was 'I didn't know people still do,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund couldn’t sit or talk until he was three years old and he still couldn’t speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk with support and ride a bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund devised for "Please sing something to me."
"We're bringing him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters himself.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what would happen.
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don’t expect it to really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy Rainfall, Flooding Leads to Rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday, with more rains expected throughout the entire Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-area flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and aid to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoa municipality had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed over large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service said an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood early warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday as it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record highs over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these rivers will only slowly flow into the Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue teams are still feeding people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said another step-son, who lives nearby, had warned him.
“We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high rise of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed by Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "expanded rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that authorities were reluctant to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground had been heavily drained by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooding caused rescues of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, which were now flooded.
Local chief Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been rinsed by floodwaters.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
“As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes,” he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to flooding and sandbags were provided for residents hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday, but no ones have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "perforated by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week for the second time that a 6-year-old was shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the thigh, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a crossfire between several gunmen.
Cartridges for storm guns, which were traced back to various storm guns, overseen the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continual struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, were sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police Department told the broadcaster.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and the police are currently checking the surveillance video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I present to myself in the women’s Olympic team in the tournament and for more than one reason.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colours.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female tournament runner-up was an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were <0x23>1 and <0x23>2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that’s not how tournament classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics is primarily held in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents, who come up with a list for the training, set-up, travel, dressing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these tournament clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the turners receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, the coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tour.
We need to provide the communities with countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, with a more efficient and easily accessible tournament training.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnastics foundation.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide the youth with high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls interested in the turn and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, grab her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start her way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in a “nobody’s country” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first-aid doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at busy times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Assistant doctors continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will warm up the current workforce crisis and deny it all.”
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and the time runs out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through negotiations met with the government’s reluctance to participate and sometimes deafening silence.
That happened with a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, lift the coercion and address the concerns of the assistant doctors".
If he does not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further labor-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialist doctors were included to provide doctors with coverage on the strike mail chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the general manager of the NHS staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Work-fighting measures achieve nothing of the few, but already overloaded teams and service providers, and prepare patients, caregivers and their families only to worry, distress and interruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to concerns regarding premonitions and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as dismissal, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum and mutual recognition of health, continuing education and the ministry of gender were in England.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of myocardial infarction patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day medication after authorities have recommended that it be given to more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE regulator of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulator of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat-containing materials in the artery walls that form deposits.
When the lining breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The NICE guidance draft, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a recurring heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guideline does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Lets Election Fraud Bloom in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being deliberately ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers, and council houses for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to “hypersensitiveness to ethnicity and religion.”
The former minister of integration and municipal government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up barriers outside election booths to intimidate intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an identity card with them in order to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, an elector only has to name his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.
“This serves not only against election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with allegations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have conducted "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He said he was particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter election - where older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including conducting IDs to prove the identity.
In his report, it states: "As evidence, pressure was put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that ... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing ballot papers to stop "choice learners."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral roll being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before the election for your ID.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they’ve cast their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter of choice.
Prohibition for political activists to edit full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
To give the police the power to set up lockdowns for polling stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photographs at polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go into the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no penalty was set.
“The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy inappropriate because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,” he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, according to the high demands in criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the ineffective "abduction controls" of the electoral registration departments of the council houses.
Sir Eric said: “The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Mad about Kate's cyclist-double and other famous Olympic doubles in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week came across the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive double rider of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who has his own famous doubles – at least not if you can trust the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double rider on the bike lane, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images he sees unusually similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star popped up.
In fact, the archer got the insanity in the social media and admitted that he has been heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much similarity myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I think I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more this year: the striking similarity between British sprinter Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is to be able to pass as a double-passer for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova features more than just the sun-brown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the turn Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Commentator Apologizes for His Statement That Chinese Swimmer "Like a Pig Died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the Dr 4x200m freestyle swimming staff upset viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "was gone like a mief" and during the race as "a pig died".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming staff.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more "color" could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like a muffin, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to open the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "like a pig died"?
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m women's freestyle swimming pool as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many putting him to the talking
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast over a floating performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the remark via Twitter
Commentator Scott Russell Apologizes on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also apologised quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made possible to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the show last night and to our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Still, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording. Byron does what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised on the show and tried to justify his remark, stating that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
“I’d like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women’s swimming season on the CBC Olympic show,” he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, there was no intentional contempt and I am very sorry.”
Buyer in Primark upset about woman trying shamelessly underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she mustered as she looked, pulled her out and put her back on the shelf.
She moved on and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried the panties before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlet, pulled out her own pantyhose and pants and tried them.
“She didn’t even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it — she just stood there, as ugly as Oskar.”
"Everybody stared as she pulled out the underpants that she obviously didn't like as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more panties before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressed up again and went out.
“She didn’t seem to mind that she was watching someone — or thinking about the person who might be buying the underwear she had tried.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that was worn by another person and that weren't washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I learned, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman dressed them up and pulled them out again and they weren’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself With Krav Maga from Arms Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
When approaching you from behind, you should be the first to turn around so that you can see your attacker and “get out of the line of fire,” says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before punching it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker is curving in pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards as they point the weapon at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and point the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi performs.
But keep in mind that in case of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright sniffs his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler underwent a serious scrutiny of his immune system and divergence reflexes – by dropping some of the dirtiest and most ugly places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, shoved his trains on a euro bill, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a sink in a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before painting each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to do.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of peeling off the sink of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing he left behind was more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public lanes at railway stations to sinks of toilets, the task of putting his immune system definitively under the test
In the film, he said, "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."
In the film, he was definitely worthy of his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample print showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminaires of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands showed one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "That comes close to the worst thing I've ever smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna put anything on here because it's ugly in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We ran crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added, "Let me say it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the ugly Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.
I’m glad we’ve filmed some of these dirty treats.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria, particularly those associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria.
Social Family Destroys Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An associative family left their social home after a <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 damage delocalization because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed flapping holes, wooden parts were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was lubricated against the walls.
The family was relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment will no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I'm of the opinion that people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered a not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found
It was at the property where drugs were traded in the past that the wooden parts were demolished.
Neighbors said they saw her fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly removed her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
The delocution was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One said out, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have failed the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant refrained from taking any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as delegating is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrifying to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community who have bravely approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that will be left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after logging
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear up the garbage heaps that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash worth <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were stained with graffiti.
Police Says They Will Deploy Tenants Who Don't Follow House Rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the deposition was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-incrimination, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal in panic after a low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Plane Launched an Incredible Fall Flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost in tangible proximity over the sun worshippers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle drives, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew really deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesperson said the jet had flown slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but the air force insisted that safety was not compromised at any time.
This summer, fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, which also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - the pilot had to fly so deep that his vision was restricted.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca worried about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting on Sunday for the first step to winning the title in the new football season.
The Catalans play out against FC Sevilla in the duel for the Spanish Supercup, with the draw rising three days later at Camp Nou.
The double-winner has to give up Neymar, who competes in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, among other things, with the inferior cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a bandage in his knee during the training, thus clarifying the question at Barca at least for the first time in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for number one for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far given up a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated in a test game of Liverpool on Saturday with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn’t really convince even in the 3:2 rehearsal against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has a 2–3 loss after being extended in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona are the record winners in this competition with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympian.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
With this, the World Rankings-First got the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes in the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese managed to make it to the final game as expected and won each other the title.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic ladder was former SVS-N<0xC3><0x96> legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone at the record, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and left their defenders alone in fair competition with each other.
“I’ve played the games for my country so far.
"In the final, I play for myself," Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China Fahne.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the game by bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitriy Ovtcharov, after which he was in medical treatment, had to "finally" settle for sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had, by the way, become fourth in a similarly high table tennis Olympia.
Donald Trump admits “heavy problems” in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditionally conservative states, to incur their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now conceded weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican borough of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something as concerns, as correspondents reported.
Now that he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the White House fight are growing.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilty of false reports about his candidacy, he again recorded his well-known media badges.
Waking up Republican high castles
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his rival Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wants to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just like I’ve done so far.”
And pushed backwards: "This will either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long vacation."
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
“If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay,” Trump said.
Then I will return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party has threatened to scrap funds to support its election campaign should it not be able to present better poll scores.
Instead, the Republicans’ candidates for Congress will be taken more seriously.
Olympia: Three-fold fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are in trouble after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a doping attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya’s team management by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.
“Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment,” the IAAF said in a statement.
“He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, handed over the sample and signed it,” said Kenya’s Chief of Mission Stephan Arab Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list for training controls.
Ferguson Rotich had become the world cup quarterback in 2015 in Beijing over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletic delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests against payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping crimes for a long time.
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping target controls imposed by the IOC prior to the Rio Games, it was unusually noted earlier that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.
The country’s athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a number of ARD television reports, there have been repeated allegations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athletics.
In this case, it was possible to prove that in this sport was doped extensively and systematically.
Russia's athletes were subsequently excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburger Festspiele present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
This is a surprise Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonardo Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temples of the classics and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral tomb, the Sim<0xC3><0xB3>n Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he mutters.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this stage, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love for Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically extraordinary.
And then there was Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an enormously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as expressive today as they were back then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined IS has been killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's bollwerk in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to keep people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democrats’ presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to “select Garland with some certainty.”
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team wouldn’t worry about unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge of the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination, being laypeople and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats Magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous nude people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old school playboys because "playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does, too.
"We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to release the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person on open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
“Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to flee Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be “a few hundred thousand,” believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s hard work following the coup attempt is expected by the Kurdish community of Germany to take a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of a few hundred thousand asylum-seekers from Turkey to Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition,” said Ali Toprak of the “World” on Friday.
Because the government already months ago covered Kurdish highlands with criminals, 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey were on the run.
After the failed coup, more secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be repressed in Turkey.
“It can’t be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The union leader complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitic cities.
With this, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "as sharply as Austria positions itself against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, there is a “hexen hunt” against Erdogan critics.
I don’t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears many Turks fleeing abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, mainly Kurds and opposition.
The branding as a Gülen follower destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already posed before the coup the largest group of asylum-seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany.
As of June 30, this number was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all people recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
In this survey, there are no refugees from war, poverty or hopelessness.
According to the Basic Law, asylum seekers are exclusively political, i.e. on the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
The 2021 national election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because stupider than before, it’s not: summer holidays, heat and country day campaign – that’s what bites.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Lake Hidden, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
There are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and ultimately count votes are just trying to push up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again allow the election campaign to pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It will be exciting how strongly Neuling cuts off the AfD and what is left in the end coalition-worthy.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is running an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you see from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as he already did his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD’s succession.
Your refugee policy, your "We make it" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him now the beautiful office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it’s like to campaign in the wrong place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to big announcements; Merkel’s Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburgers and Pre-Pomeranians.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it doesn’t hurt anyone from other parts of Germany, even to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely abandons the usual election booths on market squares and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
This, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that it is bribing the ground in the country, that it must make a great effort to find a wire to the people again.
You are going like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of CDU campaigner Kokert to his rivals is also self-defeating: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village feasts, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were 22 percent behind their partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the country’s day.
They make the holiday need a modern virtue and transfer their election campaign to the Internet for a large part.
“Online election campaign,” says the country’s president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners go on a quest for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just bouncing with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 Rehabilitation: Hospitality Suffers from Blockage
The speed at which the B27 is refurbished has nothing to do with it.
For those in charge of the construction work, which starts at 5.30 am and ends only around 8 pm, there is praise for everything.
“They’ve made everything pretty sacky,” says Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet Tank Station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, until the end of October everything is planned to be finished.
The reception of those responsible for the construction works is also promised, for example when it comes to the establishment of relief entrances.
Since the construction site migrated south on Monday and also the blockade of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is also re-established, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.
The evacuation traffic through the place seems to be going back.
“There were some significant complaints,” said Florian King, deputy chief of staff responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise because many sloops sought and were more familiar with their navi than the signage.
As a result, some trucks spread out in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not complied with, the municipality demanded more and more the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
“There were significant overruns,” says King, who once informed himself about the situation.
There have already been two to three blisters per minute.
The fastest was on the way with 77 hour kilometres in the Tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27 sanitation has led to revenue cuts in them, lets everyone who you ask see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Who has less to do with the "end customer", so produces for other companies, for which the renovation has little effect.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also admits that, of course, "the customer service is lacking".
The most crowded are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already life-threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hartly hit it".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro of revenue.
He said the revenue cuts were “far above 50 percent.”
The road refurbishment has "rejected its operation by two years".
Half of his staff had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the inn would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.
With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his inn will continue to exist.
After all, the family farm has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now passing by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't get out, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his clientele will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
They are constantly screwed to laws in the name of counter-terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re gives the Atonement.
All of his proposals are “politically reasonable” to the coalition partner, says the Federal Interior Minister when presenting his new security package.
They don't overemphasize anyone.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As interior minister, however, he was based on results and on an "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had a little time wasted before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
However, these are now all the more extensive.
One thing is already known, announced, peeled: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Neither is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is starting a second approach for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish terrorist groups and jihadists with dual citizenship to abort the German passport.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that does not have a chance with the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
They have it in part: he plans expeditious procedures for deportations and more ways to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are being brought into the country are expected to have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for security checks.
When it comes to tolerance for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before – for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally fragile.
Some also seem unsettled and leave questions open.
And at some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of patients, for example - the question arises: What does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security given the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about didn’t go unnoticed even during election campaigns.
Internal security has come to the fore.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insecurity is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioned on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been an increase between the two parties.
First, a blatant dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a collection of security policy ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of state also demand a burka ban and a reversal of dual citizenship.
The Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also struggles here for reconciling sounds.
He doesn't think anything about a reversal of the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them doesn’t make sense.
And with a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all angles and whether it is actually “controversial” for the coalition partner, it has yet to be shown.
There’s a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Sigmar Gabriel, the party’s leader, said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help increase security.”
Volkswagen is still glimpseing through.
Despite the diesel scandal, the number of deliveries worldwide is increasing.
But it doesn’t work in all markets.
In the case of recall, there are vertebrae around a term.
Volkswagen will start in the second half of the year with the deliveries of behavioural vehicles.
Europe’s largest carmaker can continue to have a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel accident thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
In July, however, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company noted in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449,100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany’s home market, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to “changed economic conditions”.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the U.S., where the emissions affair escalated first, there is also still a minus.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected Lower Saxony house brand is still glimpsing through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop in delivery of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, with 5,904 million vehicles worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated emissions tests with software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for redevelopment at the workshops.
In the course of the redevelopment, VW confirmed that the redevelopment of the cars has no negative impact.
After the refurbishment of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The carmaker issues a “guarantee-like” certificate to customers after the refurbishment, but does not speak of a “guarantee” as it was called in company circles on Friday.
The reason is legal fines.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW has to comply fully with the orders of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Derogations from this are not accepted," Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said.
VW has taken on the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to the type-approval have remained unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term “guarantee”, Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, six months after refurbishment, could come to a workshop with an engine damage – and this could be due to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of the customer, it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, as it was said, causing uncertainty regarding possible guarantee arrangements.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding from rich savers future penalty interest - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily cash accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it: Normal savers "should not be afraid to pay for their austere penalty interest".
Banks deposit money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4% penalty interest.
This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September to private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on Giro or Daily Cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has been keeping 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not make use of.
“They are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the cost,” the bank manager said.
“I can’t afford to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4000 for every million.”
The costs are now passed on according to the cause principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already had four seizures, I don't want the fifth one!"
Most of the clients had an understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few of them migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs for all banks".
To wear them alone is "economically not possible permanently".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest on deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: “We do not expect private customers to have to pay extensive fees for deposits, in addition, the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong.”
A banker said that there is a “customer on Lake Tegern” that is “a little more lucrative equipped with assets”.
“This can become a problem for a small bank if they keep money for free.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
“No other banks are currently known to the Bavarian Co-operative Association, which calculates an issue replacement for deposits from private customers,” said spokesman Ernst.
The president of the Bundesverband der Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is tough, and it threatens the emigration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the broadest sense.
Destination Discs: Who Really Buys Sound Discs?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to sow it under the pseudonym NotAllSingle MenMiddle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are all likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobbyists – it has an emotional significance: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
Are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog was a news story on television, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and stroll wildly before I stand, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So, let's go for a sewing.
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though Sohos’s heart is slowly buzzing with its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were based – there are still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part where I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mood by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (Data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long crowded because of a meeting in London and going through the stumps, going through the shops.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a large number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and plowing.
"A lot of the things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably a little too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink too much.
That's my load.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I've had, people have usually discarded their collection around 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
This would explain the boom to fans of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from items that evoke happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of consolation,” Wez says.
That’s the way it is with me as a collector, and I think it is with a lot of people.
It’s an easy way to engage spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" whispers an employee from a stack of plates.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
“Someone just came in here and said, ‘I don’t own a record player, but I’d like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product load, less music load.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who only slowly come in.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I do.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz emanates from the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a window buzzer than a grocery store.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is..." she explodes with a lover.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I give the appearance of patterning the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls group up around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them – maybe because they’re just purely decorative, some so high that it’s impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But considering that any attraction for these items means more money to the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Although my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning buzzing through Berwick Street record stores and leafing through records, while avoiding the staring look of a hideous, 30-year-old false moderator who crawls over the shoulders of middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, the shark researcher, says the record was with a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer to smash shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by Calais authorities to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to tear down 72 temporary stores where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer restaurant services, or simply sell tea for a fee of 50 cents per hour (40 pence).
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also concluded that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the Calais prefecture's concerns were "absolutely observable."
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run utilitarianly and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of people in need of protection, unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to more than 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the course of the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be underestimated.
"I keep my eyes on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He doesn’t have an explanation for his miserable 12th place at the Sugar Hut.
"To be honest, I find it hard to comment on yesterday's timing," Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze what reasons would have led to the debacle.
At the World Time Race Championships in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed lately.”
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time world timer, who had lost to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km more than three minutes.
Olympia: Tennis pros winand miss semi-final
Laura Siegemund's win ended in Rio's quarter-final: Metzingen's 32nd World Rankings missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Vigemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass her stroke once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the summer games had last occurred in 1992.
Never before did a German duo stand in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group increases to start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend – Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group is buying the start-up beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is going to be spent on the acquisition, Microsoft did not say on Thursday.
Beam launched its offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene on your own.
For example, they can give up quests to players and confront enemies, as well as provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already shutting down.
The start-up, which has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington, USA, is moving to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
For the customers, then, nothing should change by the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The live streaming market for video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by online retailer Amazon in 2014 – for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer.
Germany’s razors have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are designed to transmit speed sensors particularly effectively.
The futuristic enforcement trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centres where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on highway construction sites or bridges to be refurbished with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit there with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile build can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-contained: its battery lasts five days in uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measuring technology also allows all vehicles to be detected across several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-risk condition, the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer clutch.
In order not to be stolen easily, it is lowered in the measurement operation, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way, also shot-proof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flash from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in various federal states, according to Vitronic, and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also blinking with the new technology: France recently reordered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK wins silver in 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass wins gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7th Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis in the final on Thursday evening when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side stepping, backwards, line running and raw power to win gold – its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The boxers’ significant defeat, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB — but it probably won’t — that at least one Brit will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost to Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This slap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began miraculously and let the attacks of the GBs out of fun.
The World Series winners went 5-0 up, as Osea Kolinisau sprinted over the corner, and it felt to Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were riding buses.
With four more minutes of play time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's excellent tackle stopped man Leone Nakarawa's mountain from reaching a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the replay and there was still over a minute playing time...in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou boasted through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning to do so.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the Fiji gap...for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long passed in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the podium.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-cup with another try in the last seconds.
The Pfiff shouted, the Fijis hugged each other, and GB kicked devastatingly beaten into the lawns.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxing forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win – and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning Inspired by Fighting Trainer’s Cancer to Ruderer Victory
There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that’s what it means.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard hive that goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were sitting at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of trainer Robin Williams, was all-encompassing when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in a row in the two without a taxa, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th undefeated bet, which is also unparalleled.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph as a whole.
Behind every gold in the ruder is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, it was risky.
I had bladder cancer that was operable and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if under such circumstances that is the right term at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incitement.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station – 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it begins.
Riding in and of itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking more than anything else, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was in command of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. It's maybe something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I could not have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not cope.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen called for "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It’s really important not to get caught up in it.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t looking to do something great.
We didn’t want a firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years exemplary for clarity
Ruppert Göller, the managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", retires.
The association is considered "bayern-wide exemplary".
A small french association for drinking water as an example for large water producers.
This was stated some time ago in the original tone in a post of the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation.
A little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "bayern-wide as exemplary".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who has been an employee for 31 years in the purpose association, of which 28 years as Managing Director.
He is now retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Gruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, supplies approximately 150000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, the mayor of Breitbrunn, Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed water guardian in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water management and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairman said.
It called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high-container (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water lines.
There has been no pause at all, and innovations have been repeated over and over again, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association properly as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district Unterfranken.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, in turn, praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterman and he was a faithful knight.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the fountain construction and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights.
But the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the rupture of the pipe at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of new ground could only once be maintained, because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was transferred to Daniel Sturmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was discovered in her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago has progressed well and is now studying privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him what is two years ago when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man shoots life companion
A 35-year-old man shot and fatally injured his partner at a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) on Friday around 10.45 a.m.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his life partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, according to him being publicly flagged.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1,80 meters tall, muscular, burned and has a smoothie.
Meanwhile, the police have released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a hat.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a “relationship state.”
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any information about the incident or the relationship between perpetrators and victims, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder offense."
“We’re not saying more at the moment,” said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared millions of extra costs.
The financial burdens that threatened the industry from the eco-flow funding are off the table.
It will remain in the case of the exemption from the renewable energy relocation at the existing facilities for the so-called own-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really happy that we were able to finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to collect the gases from the furnace for their own consumption.
The steel industry, according to the German industry association, threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there will now be a reconciliation of principles with the European Commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
It is only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants that a 20 percent EEG turnover occurs.
But these are also not collected in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the European Commission on self-sustaining electricity generation.
In this way, the status quo of the previous scheme is largely defined.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"This is a first step towards our 'Steel is the future' campaign."
"Others have to follow."
“The reform of emissions trading also requires weighing climate and employment targets,” said Jörg Hofmann, Chief Metal Officer of IG in Frankfurt.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.
Last year, the situation worsened as China, the world’s largest producer, launched massive steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers are imposing price dumping on Chinese steel companies.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import duties have an effect on imported steel, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
In the end, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Lastly, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tons, they produced nearly six percent less crude steel than the previous month, the Steel Economic Union said on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now fell for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production is 2% below the previous year’s value.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the faculty study she studied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To talk and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs arouse many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia are aware of long-standing events.
In addition, when singing, the head is required a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, to focus on your own voice and a predetermined rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people, who live alone, practice this way, not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself – this experience strengthens.
There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don’t sing alone – with 50 people singing, who can hear it when a tone goes by?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the familiar circle sings in a senior choir, you can easily join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.
Anyone who wants to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can speak directly to the church or the church leader.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask family, friends, or neighbors for help in Internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats are more sensitive than cats to young animals’ screams
Biologists in Hannover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, the miauen did not leave the males cold, but they always behaved the same as the females.
Female cats can detect the degree of arousal of cat babies at the miauen of the little ones.
They respond ten percent faster to the noise of kittens who are in great need, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the call of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miau of less and highly aroused young animals for the males are either not perceptible or unimportant," said Biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology" on Friday.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten’s scream differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult kittens and eight kittens from the MHH’s animal husbandry were observed.
They were played for a call of little ones, who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more aroused kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
“All females, even those who had no offspring of their own, responded differently to the scream,” Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker more quickly when this call of the very excited kittens played out.
This ability may be congenital or develop with the sexual maturity.
“It was a surprise that the males had reacted at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükur.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game has taken place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual".
Even at the end of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July, the government insisted that the daily life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping before football, either.
Against former Starkicker Hakan Sükur, the prosecutor’s office issued an arrest warrant.
According to the report, Szukur, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sukur is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is being held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact, it has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly “democracy watch” in public places across the country has ended on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers club Besiktas traditionally do not belong to the friends of the president.
But what the majority of the Turks unite in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether your heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
The winner of the "Gala" Cup will be especially pleased with Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne proved its sporting value in the last season: With 17 goals and nine goals in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the club’s top scorer.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the Cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a similar conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also broke out early in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it was only six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
“We did it and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Meister Besiktas, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 season hits as Super League goalkeeper king laid the ground for the 14th title.
That’s also why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old’s return.
In doing so, the AC Florence contracted and only loaned Gomez to Besiktas after the coup attempt, because of the political situation in the country not to return after his EM leave.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," Fikret Orman, head of the club, quoted Kicker magazine as saying.
However, the striker should be willing to give up about a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman said: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite doping, these athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has been jailed twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other converted athletic sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The theme of doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimowa, who had complained about her right to start just before the games after a doping blockade, was ruthlessly exhausted and exhausted at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a strange scene: with a smiling face she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was determined that she would not bring gold, the audience burst into a cheering storm.
But there are still many other athletes who are going to start at the Olympic Games in Rio despite doping history.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was arrested twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion is even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger by Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m/Jamaica): The two-time Olympian and seven-time World Champion had to take a six-month lockdown in 2010 after she was proven to take the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe dental pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, the 2013 World Champion and the 2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly ingesting the drug and was jailed for six months.
This year’s four biggest dice will go to the big gold favorites.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had tested positive in 2010 and was locked for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, Merritt argued.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly an athlete has been awarded so many medals afterwards.
Thus, Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European title due to testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games by the International Court of Justice (CAS).
At 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion has been found to have taken a banned dietary supplement, the blockade of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and expired as early as July 13.
Bombing in Thailand - Austrian Woman Injured - Several Dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave this one again.
She planned her trip home in early September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is unclear at first.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, says Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, was initially detonated on Thursday evening in an outskirts of two bombs.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosions were reported, with another person killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket in the early morning.
In the detonation near the popular beach Patong, which is popular for holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to police.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the blast went into the air in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police revier.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several casualties.
One assumes an association with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings are carrying the same manuscript," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
“This is just local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country – but they have not been informed about the exact time and locations.
It is not yet clear which group was behind the attacks.
Police have instructed officials across the country to increase security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement areas.
There are smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are usually not aimed at tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand’s king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) was applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is advised not to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will have a great influence on the military in the years to come.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military runna, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is in favour of bringing the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to capture the insurgency of Muslim rebels that has been raging in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "Identity Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutionalists in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identary Movement' hints at efforts against the democratic fundamental order of freedom," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection at the German press agency in Berlin.
For example, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamated in an extremist way.
That is why we are watching the movement now.
The "Identity Movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identities".
Maaßen said his authority had agreed closely with the state officials on the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to get their target group where it stands," the chief of constitutional protection said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
This is what Islamists and right-wing extremists do.
This is not a blatant advertisement for your own business.
Propaganda is supposed to emotionally appeal to people.
Young people are vulnerable in a particular way.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the “identities” with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no evidence of this.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point onwards.
It depends on whether the respective party – in this case the AfD – changes its direction and becomes extremist by certain people who are extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or small groups are forming that are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee hemispheres or attacks on other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or European-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that there were many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum-seekers had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who may have been politically indifferent or have chosen for example CDU, SPD or left, but then radicalized by right-wing extremist sentiment."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet hit
The Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.
This is evidenced by Robel Kiros' brave appearance at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Games.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended his run with a 48-second rebound and finished in 59th place out of 59 starters.
Rather, it was his not-so-sports figure who attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was given a special right to swim by the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
Quickly, the first nicknames made the round.
Some media have referred to him as the "Robel of the Whale".
In response to a "poverty belly" the English boulevard magazine "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-metre freestyle, didn’t matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been drawn.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to run in a run of over 100 meters freestyle alone.
Moussambani was fired at the time.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at Neuen Platz has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsriederin left her shop on Monday at 5:30 p.m., forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8:15 p.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
The traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the imminent election defeat so tightly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is speaking at an election campaign event in Florida.
If it doesn’t happen with the election to the U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
Then he's going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November, he doesn’t care: “At the end of the day, it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with US television station CNBC.
“If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay,” Trump said.
He called U.S. President Barack Obama and Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terror militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post is increasing in the trade with electric transporters
An electric supplementary vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is obviously great.
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
Soon the group wants to start trading with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year as well.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," a post-speaker said on Friday.
The company has been checking for months to see if it will sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which will deliver letters and parcels, to other companies as well.
Post-CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there is always demand, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon start mass production of the vehicles.
In the continuous manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes has announced that the Group wants to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and is aiming for a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we're relocating the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014.
GfK leadership declines after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its CEO Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK indicated that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become more insecure, the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberger Marktforschungsgesellschaft GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world number five industry is facing a personal new beginning.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the GfK, Arno Mahlert, will be leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the Board of Directors is already taking over by 1 September the previous member of the Board of Directors Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company announced.
He is to officially assume the function of a "speaker of the board" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As the reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesperson did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the shareholders were most recently disappointed with the continuing successes of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK-Spitze since 2011.
"But the results of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," it said.
In the face of the last poor GfK business numbers, each shareholder will be uneasy at some point.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same,” he said.
The company had not been able to stop its losses even in the second quarter of 2016, following rebounds in the previous quarters.
With EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 per cent by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>721.2 million.
The profit in the second quarter has been burdened above all by the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business, resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had another group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in graves: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich) in a passenger bus with 43 seniors as passengers.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old bus driver of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her, had to avoid an encountered load, which was partly driving on the intersection.
The bus got off the street to the right and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman for the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people were not able to leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire department liberated the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on State Highway 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Krummhörn district of Pewsum by a bus.
There you should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage system Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros so far; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (so far 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (so far 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After a superfluous calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that there were undercuttings for these sewage plants.
The market in Kasendorf is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner.
From 1 October 2016, citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the wallet.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Chief Administrative Officer Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater treatment plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-coverages from the previous calculation period will also be offset.
The serious increase in fees was justified by the fact that all three wastewater plants are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater impact, which is between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a significant impact.
In addition, the amount of waste water in all three plants is slightly reduced.
Furthermore, in the last calculation period, for all three installations, not least because of their age, renovation and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf sewage system due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be completely refurbished and after almost 20 years of operation, the first clarification dam had to be excavated, the clarification sludge discarded and an additional ventilation facility could be installed in order to make the water-restricted forage.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were the prescribed maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the small wastewater attack in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "completely exceeded".
In this regard, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared from high maintenance costs for wastewater installations over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Wastewater Association could not be extended by these plants because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, July 2016 saw a price increase in the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); and health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education unchanged.
Snapchat 'Anime' Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are flawless, feature-shifting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them of promoting the app Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed a filter to some users this week that gave them slit-eyes, false teeth, and jagged cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurting clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely circulated, wrote that the filter was "injurious and inconvenient to say the least."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been drawn to the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that crosses this cultural stalker wire.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people – who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts – might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters generates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company has recently hired a personnel manager who focuses on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said she will be leaving her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that it’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, congressional committee finds
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee said in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, drawn up by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Wehrmacht Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported as superiors their assessments of Islamic change to American efforts in the struggle.
Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, typically discredited by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than actual conditions would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other news services," the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors at Centcom go all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts in training Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct evidence that top officials under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to the pressure of their precepts to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIS.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Department of Defense Inspector General.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which aligned with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said the senior Democrat on the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports,” damaged the morale among analysts and “gave too little room for divergent opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no indication of a White House intervention by Centcom analysts regarding a “determined political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon’s Inspector General, which were recorded after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on congressional reports while the Inspector General’s investigations were still underway.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense.”
The investigations have repercussions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
Last year’s accusations, however, raised the question of how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recalls ambiguity from more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush, in contrast to the recommendations of many analysts, was little more than a bit of an Irastruppe.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurgency against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker found, according to government agencies, that contrary to the government’s statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have had a significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these temporary refineries would have put the market into operation to fuel Schwar.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom’s then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins fourth match in women’s field hockey, a showdown with the United Kingdom is ahead
One day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keeps their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same time in their group with the British, who remain in the first place after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams in their group of six will get the first and second place respectively.
The first-placed will go out of the way to the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the game may be on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after landing in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey beater in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she was unable to qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team and so things began to turn for the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the job in London that we now have.
We've been able to completely pull the rope around.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the towers in the first half of the game with a backhand from the nearby area.
India went into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the game going from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and shoved the ball into the goal to provide the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games so far.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amidst the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a race between competition and aspirations.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed from the armrest shooter to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without listening to about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and is a women’s swarm with grits, could well have been under those well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, a turner or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.
But if I may modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely perceived in the last 16 years that many of the people I had interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012 there was an athlete who managed to make it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unexplained ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a grounded enthusiast.
It has humorous potential – the cardboard shaking of its never-ending impact – but also the grace of turning and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "springboard."
Ascending winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (turns, crochets, and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic programme by performance, difficulty level and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal-hoppers need to go further, faster, up and over in their quest for gold, sometimes up and down to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the finish line or the exit wall, but also another high-profile goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it’s enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I feel a little tired of watching these games myself.
Of these, the trampoline offers a pause.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A move forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 p.m.
In the middle of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.
If raising awareness can only be achieved by targeting and targeting male athletes – as the men’s U.S. tournaments recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley is expecting his airborne, new fan community.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia came up against the government’s violent resistance.
Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during clashes with police during gunfights.
Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government’s response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed unarmed demonstrators on zig.
Videos circulating about the protests, probably from last or early this year, show how security guards beat young people with punches while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have continually led the government’s repression – the opposition in the country has been curtailed, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or into prison, killed or driven into the vast desert.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and these have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous grievances that cover everything from land use to wrangling in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this fragile, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which has been more or less forced in recent years, could exploit turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of sneezing.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have very many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which they do at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they gathered in protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and the Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For ages, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, thrived in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012 in an unpublished illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly proficient in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were apparently disguised by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer than in recent months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disapproval of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked businesses in Gondar, an Amharic city, run by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin grass walk."
Donald Trump Says Obama Founds ISIS as “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by claiming that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group was not meant to be serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his co-conspirators, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the implication at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump retweeted the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he took the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism swirls down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling polling values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave talks on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the issue.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm for his defense.
At the end of July, he drew heavy criticism when he felt that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later explained, "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rudely back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then possibly “clear” depending on how the reaction falls out,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more eerie tone as his poll scores have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a major lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal counterparts in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments,” Mr. Giuliani said, so he was asked whether Mr. Trump’s statements were correct or whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by allowing it to aggressively bring the situation in the Middle East under control.
Before the campaigning events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on every word of his and being biased against him.
He scorned the “poor, jerky” television experts who were trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
Once pushed over the price from the market, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay for cash that didn’t have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were driven from his Bedford Avenue storefront.
Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals trusted it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded, and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
A revamped verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
“I realized it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she’s drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual iced coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been a long-time and loyal customer.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn’t have a grudge about the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to go into her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee in bottles.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the floor when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a weakness for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as P<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and a plum pudding as a dessert.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about living in a residence on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will be published by Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snow-free snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 Stock Exchange Crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
“Rich foods were very popular,” said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something inexpensive that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pasta was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country coped with being no longer the swarming country.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe began, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: mysterious foods such as bread and cashews became staples, the cashews as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the centerpiece of American cuisine, became a rare served luxury.
Odd blends have been tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious gratification had priority over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to lunchtime,” Coe says.
He continued, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or ever since, economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943—driven the country’s eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and to meet the challenge of turning poppies like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
Particularly tasty are the reports about the government’s response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s let-me-cake-eating attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking.
He was a wonderfully realist.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in Ms. Roosevelt’s flavors led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most restless prepared.”
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
At the time of writing the book, the couple had a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother-in-law – for example, how she could not throw away food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
Then there was the windbag incident.
After the plates had been cleaned up at Eisenberg's, they and Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
“It’s called Prune Whip,” said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss a chic name for modest recipes.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone slightly reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tender, brown slippers.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe got a hit three times.
As a can-do budgetier he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has saved nearly 60,000 lives so far, according to Bild-Zeitung.
2,900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the lifeguard showing him on an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the gray of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, he said in the picture: "For me, this is the real jihad."
“If I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people were suffering from respiratory distress.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims well 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks do not grow until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters away.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to sat 2.6 km/h – and at this top speed is half as fast as a robbe.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a pathetic recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
“Insanity,” comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock on this life span, which is a world record for vertebrate animals.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are becoming rocky.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers don’t know much about the Greenland shark’s lifestyle.
They measured their tempo when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks are still preying: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for corpses torpedoing down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, which fishers took from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as a start.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres tall.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens cores of the shark using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments smuggled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the 220-centimeter-long third-smallest animal, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its 2012 investigation.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetres long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of sexual maturity, and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously take at least one and a half centuries to reproduce.
This is also expected to be a world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland walrus, whose bait had a 120-year-old harpoon tip on its neck, was also captured in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on a sparing flame.
So they ripen later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal absorbs heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
“So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible,” explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in a double package
In the last meeting, the municipal council has focused on issues surrounding construction.
With relief, the board took up the announcement from Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the newly designated residential areas can begin".
After the property, parceling and development issues have been clarified and the applications for measurement have been submitted, the sale of the property in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - extension section 1) is not an option for interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and cozy seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can immediately report to the town hall, the council is expected to advise on the assignment of the plots in its September meeting.
In order to also be able to meet requests for the settlement of other commercial establishments, associated with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan in subdivisions only in the spring of this year.
For example, the commercial area already designated there is expanded in the area of undertimers by two parcels in the direction of Staatsstraße 2112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the main, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies displaced from London.
“Frankfurt is very likely to benefit the most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s financial and real estate markets competence field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London out of financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, so far, they have enough admission in the UK.
That’s what big U.S. banks are doing.
Several banks have already announced that they will move jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby association expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which brings together the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB.
In Paris, although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervisory authority," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, it is also worse off than Dublin in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris it’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In the Mercer Business Consultancy ranking, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg at 19th, Dublin at 33rd and Paris at 37th.
Although quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, economic researchers say.
In London, according to Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it as a result of the Hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million damages payment for the violation of two patents by Merck, which were in connection with the blockbuster medications Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge had a pattern of misconduct on the part of others, including Merck.
On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to release the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
U.S.-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are now going through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have liberated more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently carrying out clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earning $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State gave $3 million to her publisher Simon & Schuster in Outer Time for her book.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his promises to publish his tax returns so far.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
“They’re on the train,” Clinton’s campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democrats’ presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until tax checks are completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his rejection raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business associates, and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already stumbled upon the issue and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax return to be released.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last few decades and to publish his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times economic journalist cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
During an election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is headquartered here, called for a meeting to exchange Trump’s tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subject to a tax audit by the IRS and that Trump had “fear” of voters and not of tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published a tax return dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that they only earned $100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main cash investment was a cost-effective index fund from which Clinton’s dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania elephant protection
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms at them that are filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the U.S. Nature Conservation Agency by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and harvests.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with much more confidence that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "Chili people" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned up to the ignition cord.
When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a lump and sprays fine powdered chili powder into the air.
A hint is usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower that shoots a gold-regen fireworks into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No kiosk building on St. Goar's Rhine
Usually St. Goar’s investment projects are accepted by business owners with a kiss hand – but retail in the city centre is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales ski area on the Rhine River, close to the river balconies under construction.
“Basically, we welcome new businessmen, but at this location on the Rhine, in an exposed location, this kiosk does not fit,” Michael Hubrath told the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli phone number was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots decapitated a media outcry after he had told the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin that it had not listed an Israeli zip code as it had "requested" Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" released his annoyance at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s list of countries.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the dial-up be deleted," the Lanzmann employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-trademan, called this a “great shame,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
We were shocked and dismayed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has occurred in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "take the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "submitted to the alleged requests of Arab guests".
“Shame on you,” it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is located near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed off all the allegations and called the incident a "mistake" and "excused" Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
“There was never a direct order to not include Israel on the shortlist,” the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms for the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
Difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spraying against interim President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests took place a few days after mass protesters took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been ousted by a Senate vote on her resignation.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade sales between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are building existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is expected to hit a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign agency issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that last year’s record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witness sought: Beverage market attacked in forest oil
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Keeping a firearm, three dark-clothed people, who had mutilated their faces, demanded cash from the beverage market employee and then fled on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money was confiscated, the police did not say.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and poorly visible.
After the assault, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and fled from the scooter parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who made observations at the time of the robbery (as of 7:45 p.m.) should immediately report to the police.
Nagold: Play and Fun in Summer Leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social-educational day group/social group work of the Kinderschutzbund Nagold with their caregivers during their summer leisure time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet recreational home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was housed during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children’s guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at Lake Tiefen in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plan.
Culinary children and caregivers were pampered with their self-prepared meat dishes such as the sour Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops a Roman mill game was baked, beautiful jewellery made of pearls and stones or made of wood.
Other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on fire and the closing "Bunte Evening".
On the day of the return trip, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home contentedly.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four phases were managed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Roman Wall journey of all ministers is expected in two years, the Upper Ministerial Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Several pilgrimage destinations were examined and the final decision was made for the episcopal city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the door of mercy opened for this purpose at the Freiburg Monastery.
16 Minis made of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and holy rooms went on their way.
The night before, Pastor Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim's Cross and gave the Pilgrim's Blessing.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Münster Unserer Lieben Frau and so the pilgrimage route was started from Münster.
The individual day tours were each framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and scripts.
But also on the way, the minis made time and again rest at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from specially composed pilgrimage.
For the overnight stays, parish homes of the local parishes were available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast at the stage goals.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
Days later, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to be climbed down to about 500 meters of altitude and then climbed again.
The reward earned in the evening was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived later in the afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and passed through the gates of mercy.
With a little pulse, God was thanked.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home as Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rose to fame last night in the men's team sprint at Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had become his own. The boy made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after scoring only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in March, despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in a timely manner.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the scotland that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph with Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a great victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stand."
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We’ve gotten away with so many world titles so bad that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we will have five successful days in Velodrom.
With Kenny's form, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) – a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
The same goes for Hoy.
Kenny is next to take part in the sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm only enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to be knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was further good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They reached the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record for winning gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final rounds (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, with Wiggins sure to be in focus.
He had quarreled with officials before qualifying yesterday when officials called him in to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women’s competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
There were dramas in the background, such as the resignation of technical leader Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of majors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first night of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland's smelter is questionable due to the cancellation of the energy contract
The future of the Portland-Victoria aluminium smelting – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2,000 jobs – both direct and indirect – could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be dominoes, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry fusion plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's smelter in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially due to the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to cancel their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL expects the plant to continue operating in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the fusion plant,” the company said in a statement.
AGL went on to say that the contracts were so-called “back-up deals” that should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impacts on AGL’s revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual accounts amounting to $187 million in “expectation of termination”.
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts, the "ability of Alcoa... to operate the smelter or to ensure power supply to the smelter" did not affect.
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have come into effect from November this year, even though it still owes an explanation as to why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are warning of the potential closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to poor economic conditions in the industry.
In reference to analysts' statements earlier this week, Stephen Mikkelsen, the Head of Operations, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity per year.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And for us as electricity generators, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and runner at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?) scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most popular showbiz-onkel, they all have a classmate of Rob and Caitlyn.
This represents the cliché-like action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we forgot you?", with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a broadcast site at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to take her other girls to some public place.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have beaten her when it comes to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is the best-selling edition of the year for Vogue.
With a scope that resembles a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, from the 832 pages of the waltz, 615 pages of advertising).
The unveiling of his coverstar is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the earlier category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (although all of this applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner’s success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the losers of the moment."
These feelings boiled again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the misfortune seems to be passing the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
It works for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises for your foundation by Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to Love magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their kids.
Municipal law centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need of assistance are rejected annually by municipal law centres, while the industry focuses on the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence and those who do not have the means for unjust deportations and the like - are already denied free legal advice and legal assistance when they seek legal aid.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of Quéesland’s Municipal Law Centers, James Farrell, said the latest survey by the National Association of Municipal Law Centers found that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned down from important services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unpredictable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly fired – all of these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they can’t get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent, meaning thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their customer communities, as well as that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump indicted after employee allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been indicted for alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had fired a gun on an employee while on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that “this would not happen.”
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drawn a gun, put his right index finger on the detachment, and rammed the run in Vincent's kneecaps," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The charge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment People” — gun owners and gun friends — should take action if his rival, Hillary Clinton, were to be prosecuted.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not lash out at violence.
Bordini’s complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, was not available for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local broadcaster in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far run a controversial campaign.
The proceeding is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) mark significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This was revealed by representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black coalition could hardly continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have good chances of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party is just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left comes to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country’s parliament.
Despite a slight loss of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent), the Greens re-entered the Schweriner Landtag.
The NPD and the FDP would not be represented in the country's parliament with 3 per cent each.
According to the poll, the SPD only came to 23 percent in the Berlin House of Representatives (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
They are still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives with 14 percent for the first time.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the draw as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to market.
The successors now dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone now comes with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the store exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to meet a lot of standards at the time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator to be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A pocket calculator, a digital address book and an electronic calendar were available.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then they found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, if not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile sector experienced an unprecedented disaster, which was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled down.
Today, the market is dominated by vendors, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, this is everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million.
Global sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-run business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has now emerged.
The key breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and an Internet communicator, all to be easily operated via touch screen.
Apple’s triumph began, and even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the look back.
They eventually disappeared, and Blackberry had to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors such as Samsung have said so.
The smartphone is of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks on his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, responsible for personnel at Siemens.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country renewal and prosperity.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just like back in 2012 in London, when we put a lot of effort into making sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new jobs, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in witty growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion time and budget infrastructure investment program, from the T5 – which was voted the world’s best airport terminal five years in a row – to the T2, which was built amidst the world’s two most frequented runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, backed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one as well.
It’s time for us to drive this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking come as a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to again block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding regarding its ads to make it difficult for ad blockers to recognize which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the ad-blocking Open Source community and the surroundings has been going on since the invention of ad blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study from last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has put it aside for ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it would update its “advertising preferences tool” to give people more control over targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
“For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a daunting tool, which is why we’ve instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman overrun in suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit in the early hours of Thursday by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman appeared in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and were hit by several cars, police in Waadt said.
It’s obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been reported, but some have still not been identified, police said, calling on them and any witnesses to the incident to report.
An investigation procedure has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Could a collision be avoided?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases – in which a person was running in the dark on the highway – it was decided that the motorists did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was released from negligent killing after she overran and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could have exhibited Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly rotated on.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-side to the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus, similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once thought to be habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen was released, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy returned as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday and led to a lack of co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the summer, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it, and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches scored a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strikes
Work struggles over the remuneration of North Sea oil workers will be suspended as all parties to the conflict sit at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,” it said in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day sessions in the coming weeks, which will start early next year to tackle the problems again.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group has cut the rates for its North Sea contractors by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the space it needs to get through the market fluctuation.
Shell has fired thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotational periods are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a decelerating effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rate of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars rotating slower than smaller pirouettes.
"In the ballet of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we’d like to know about, how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their “dancing shoes”.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A Controversial Baseball Star Resigns
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
Following his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old will be wearing his New York Yankees’ jersey for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I say 'Goodbye' to both of them," said the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was selected three times as the most valuable player in the league, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signing under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of his contract on December 31, 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), the Texas Rangers (2001–2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he made some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main stats.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to taking banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, due to an involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal, it was closed for 211 parties until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the lockdown was reduced to 162 more meetings.
"The league could have done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said.
Even his farewell days do not go unnoticed.
While many baseball legends won the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson is said to have received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the fans sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An accomplished athlete would almost have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the critically athletic competitions.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Justice for Sport (CAS) confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, missing the bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to take part in the 50m freestyle run.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-test and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen's full co-operation in the investigations," Xinhua quoted in a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Justice for Sport CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive test went through at Danekova, the 33-year-old went into the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is supposed to be the blood doping drug EPO.
Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample is said to have already failed positively.
The Bulgarian Prime Minister, Bojko Borissov, immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, not all weight lifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days before.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletics, especially the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world association IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from starting, with one exception due to systematic doping, and the runner-up nation Kenya also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the sport of swimming, the previous offenses in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang bitterly.
"Sun Yang Pinkelt Purple."
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of an argument with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping scammers,” he said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to be locked for three months.
Data theft: How perfide hackers blackmail their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past 12 months have been at least once, in part multiple times victims of an attack with blackmail software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been targeted by ransomware extortion.
40 percent of victims voluntarily paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize in their blackmail software, according to malware bytes’ observations, looking at attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom that can potentially be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
“We are currently witnessing a horrifyingly rapid evolution of malware,” said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks has been horrifyingly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it specifically searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the original permanently.
Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the end-encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money – mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, it is for companies that sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.
22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop doing business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks several times, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always say to the victims: don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of the standstill in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to earn more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are released after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to partially negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware about within a week.”
However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software build box to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between $1,000 and $10,000.
“Included is a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log in to one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that are better at securing their data.
More than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the malwarebytes survey rely on being able to defend against ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Therefore, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for successful detection, the perpetrators are instead threatening with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes.
As a result, the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is still many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacking conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get an internet-connected thermostat under their control.
In the middle of winter, the freezing of such blocked heating could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not seem narrow anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well processed and appear pleasant, only the top of the cockpit falls slightly.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage room.
Not only is there a 453 litre suitcase with raised and 1026 litre with folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating surfaces of the rear seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus provide storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is slightly higher with 650 mm than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is likely to do his job a little quieter.
Enjoyable is the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l petrol tank with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a bit more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (working up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the Track Hold Assist.
The collision warning is sometimes irritated because it ranks many obstacles as "recurring objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent timer responds to traffic sign recognition and shifts the speed if needed.
But the full connectivity is only available for top-notch equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will get the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For a liability is only conceivable in the case of hazards typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man compensation.
Case of illness: when the organizer pays
Sick vacationers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undeniably found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, a family was seriously ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish vacation.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly contaminated the seawater.
The family felt that the trip had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.
In fact, the clarification system was defective.
However, the organiser only heard about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was okay.
He did not infringe on his information obligations, according to the judgement.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infecting each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be concerned about further attacks.
At the same time, the state must resolutely and resolutely respond to terrorist threats.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this victory to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, however, this would increase security and also strengthen the population’s approval for refugee policy.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re wants to implement the proposals by the 2017 federal election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces, "in an average four-digit order over several years".
Advocacy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, weapons law is to be novelized in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is especially difficult.
According to de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>res, the last much-discussed obligation of silence for doctors is to be maintained.
However, in dialogue with the medical community, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger to the citizens, he said, looking at mental constraints.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
In order to prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help increase security further.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
“That was a big earring for the snipers in the CDU/CSU,” Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general prohibition of full cover-up to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green boss Simone Peter accused the minister of simulating action and action with ever-new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party chief Bernd Riexinger said: “Flottish rhetoric and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country.”
Improved traffic flow on the motorway conveyor
It is regularly piled on the bypass road - here is a picture from November.
But that should change: the right-hand curve should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night when they drive across the highway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16th/17th August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße, the right-bending track will be extended by 700 metres.
Drivers can then turn right from the hammer road.
The big advantage: the traffic splits up more early, which improves the overall run-off on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.
The narrowing of the highway on the conveyor irritates the motorists especially between 5 pm and 7 pm.
On working days, the backbone extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Way and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle ear on the B 51 just before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only steered through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing force to take up heavy-duty traffic in a two-track manner.
How long this shortfall and the associated work-day congestion will last, the competent country company cannot say.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official residual life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand curve, the state-owned company has consciously chosen the weaker time during school holidays because it is expected to have disabilities.
The traffic will pass on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 attended the stage in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the youngsters in the class came to Munich between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster.
The association Nima’s, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from spraak, and the Junge Theater will collaborate in the upcoming period as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language intermediation are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of star-sniffing: hope for better weather
The weather has made the star-studded guckers in the southwest of Germany a streak through the bill on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was poorly suited for observing the sky spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies in the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will certainly see a lot of stargazing in the sky.
The star clusters are Perseids, which are among the fastest star clusters at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restorative Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleeping long before waking up.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is often or permanently not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be various causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weess, member of the Board of Directors of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood here is insomnia, i.e. a sleep disturbance.
Many people feel sleepwalking is unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of directors of the German Association of Hausärzte with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What Is Behind Sleep Disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There may be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is the expression of another disease.
“Very early waking up is especially common with depression,” says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors affect each other.
For example, if you have a bandwidth attack, you can lie down poorly, wake up every two to three hours, and possibly start worrying about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and is impaired during the day should go to the doctor, advises Weess.
The impairment can look very different: one is tired, tired, sleepless, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor, advises Weess.
It can be used to investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the hospital and what happens?
For examination in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, in case of snoring with breath exchangers, in case of sick daytime fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers or if one cannot find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Just don’t go to bed for lunch,” says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose goggle, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping ones.
How can those affected get the problems under control?
There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can put on for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleep and wake-up times, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV for sleeping, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and this is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing cut off of the DSV team at Olympias.
In December 2014, he won gold at the Doha Short Track World Championships for the first time and set his first world record at the same time.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up via Facebook defending against his ex-teammates in criticism.
“In a country where an Olympic champion receives a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 prize and a jungle king 150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The transport system in swimming sports is bad, the doping controls, on the other hand, very good.
This means we can’t compete with countries that promote a lot and don’t look so closely at the topic of doping or even run it.
"I'm not saying that controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Devils had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That’s the way it should be with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled for some time before the WM/OS by independent controllers of WADA/FINA are not allowed to participate," the election citizen, who now runs an ice skating dilemma, said in a statement.
Airport: Band of Luggage Thieves Arrested
Professional thief at Dusseldorf Airport
Civilian traffickers of the Dusseldorf Police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bags and luggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9:30 p.m., civilian officials in the area of the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had been involved in community, work and particularly professional activities.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove the thieves who had entered Germany specifically for the purpose of committing crimes, four acts.
In total, they had borrowed more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a rest of the headstone plaster: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not act like this at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk the road from east to west, you get to playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioshop.
On the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of a gray house someone sprayed "evil!"
Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this “trend district”, as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are preferred to be depicted with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
In particular, Berlin’s interior senator Henkel had repeatedly advocated a tough police action against the project, calling the area a “no-go zone” for policemen and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, which were forged, had been cleared by 300 police officers on 22 June, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, blocking parts of the road and stopping visitors.
Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners renovated the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers marched under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the Bürgersteig in front of the houses in the sun, others talk late.
A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiev since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are especially upset by the police presence.
With the residents of the housing projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a kiez who wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The grave, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which also today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House crews and the housing projects born from them have long been part of Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street very close to Riga.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a regular street battle under great police command, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Electoral Berliners from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from GDR times and former homeowners now share their choice.
This is also noticeable in terms of rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 with new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on cast discs or freshly painted facades, which were cast with color bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damages, which tend to be more likely to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is disheartening: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neubauer has consciously moved into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That’s why it was so important for the residents to get their way back: from the police, the politicians and the media, who all of a sudden claimed the interpretation of the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like new builders, the road is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that push the old inhabitants.
“These are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting to many here – people who are not so well-behaved are more likely to live here,” she says.
"I can't stand violence and destruction at all."
But what to do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Anyone who is raising should be aware of this – just as someone who is moving to a pub can complain badly about noise there.

Urban: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.
She is also a social worker on the spot.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, refugee relief workers, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the work circle suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying woolen dairy cow, who has a problem above all.
Thus, some - less mocking than targeting the variety of desired areas of work - had meant that the administration wanted to appoint the position.
A managerial staff with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought an egg-laying woolen milk cow.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people locally and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has held a 50 percent position for three years.
“It was high time,” says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized for some time.
The communes are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented dwellings.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from the Land Council Office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn’t work so far, relying on private apartments, says Deuschle.
Therefore, municipal apartments need to be considered, as it is called so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.
However, it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are traineeships, training places, schools, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine customer reports.
Many work in the construction yard or help homeowners, do non-profit work - and this motivated and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
It's not "employment therapy."
But work is not just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
This is where administration and volunteers come in.
It is essential that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can meaningfully bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he can’t help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
But there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "people who do nothing at all." Therefore, the work of Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others.
All of this is a “mammuth task.”
A difficult question: are the two, after the recent events, afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some may call na<0xC3><0xAF>ve." But a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.
However, the helpers are already aware.
These incidents are also a topic for refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassins would bring them all to their attention.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, principals and volunteers on site and in the region need to keep an eye on activities.
They are always in the background that soon a new clash of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
In fact, it is unfair to place them helpers on the spot.
“In Urbach we have not yet reached where we want to go,” says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already equipped to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: burglar with helicopter sought
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unidentified men entered an apartment in a multi-family house on Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50am.
The occupant surprised the two and slammed the inconvenience into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled to the city centre.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter for the launch.
The march went unsuccessfully.
Possibly the unknowns noticed before the act near the apartment or during their escape.
