The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor the "confectionery".
The new city councillors from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and in the City Council at all.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has once "snuck off" members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD council as they master the notorious snake, which has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were in Prague on the ruder.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the late era of mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most well-known actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new boards in relation to these new terms tap something in the dark.
At least they claim that.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"I have no idea."
"I am rather a newcomer to Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "paten vocabulary".
But also the councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
“That’s the only expression you present to me here that I use over and over again.”
“I don’t like snakes very much.”
From the vocabulary published by the daily newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June of this year before the election congress of the ODS, the editorial board picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously related to the Prague Magistrate.
The social democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "biggest Prague golf hole", "go to the confectionery", "Stienecken", "Betrayal of the capital" and "bleak".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation at first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, refused the test from the start.
“I don’t care about these things and how the civil democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge.”
“It’s important to me how we understand each other within our programs,” he said.
As already indicated, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not recognize in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, was speaking.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly coined during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said, adding, "but I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find this figure and thus also what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is quite close to solving the puzzle when you know that this is the seat of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
In agreement with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he maintains that he had more to gain this knowledge from the newspaper than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly nationalized snake among the Social Democrats.
“I asked my colleagues, too, but obviously something like that doesn’t really exist with us.”
"We call ourselves by name, we also use abbreviations or nicknames over and over again," says the chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> - by his party mates called salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that too," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party partners of the "opa" or less friendly to the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who noticed before the elections by means of the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
In this way, nicknames are the only ones that allow the Social Democrats to use intra-party language.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly does not like it when called "Hulda", but Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Knuckle-Rights" is alleged to have been attributed to Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>'s acquisition of his title of Doctor of Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "hexen" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they do not find work – for example, for health reasons, they are vacant and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are seldom affected by this fate."
“Young and healthy women, too, are spared this, as they help at work and give birth to children,” a nurse describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than one hundred women who have been robbed by their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he issued a brochure to prevent "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "der Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
However, to be visited by witches is also going on and on in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov<0xC3><0xA1> was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured her over with oil and just ignited her.
Among other things, the BBC server reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the case had only been a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual ointments.
And that's after the group tried to "eject an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of “hexen” supports the people here regardless of their education.
“The Standard” quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: “Fresh women of human souls are once as dangerous as they are today,” he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to de-escalate the witch hunt, the Gambian president himself has intervened in the past year.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, was a monstrous witch hunt, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
"To this end, he called on Shamane from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, abducted women and men forcibly from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai International," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the incubated people were forced to drink an abscess from plants with a hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A renter from Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a folder with three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three were just increased rents as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is expected to collect 4100 kroner next year for a 2-bedroom apartment with a second category kitchen.
"And then there is not even flowing warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he pointed with his finger angry at the new lease of the son, to whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-voted and half-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease terms as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7th, when they will be asked to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just tilts away.
“One says this, the other says this,” he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes the great "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation faces most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-based rents.
Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG war room in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning this Tuesday breaks full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and there is a caller.
"Rent 2011", a special touchscreen touch panel illuminates.
Shortly taped and already the device splashes out a number plate.
We hardly have deciphered the number "157" and already peeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the common problems – repairs, insurance matters, and the like.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will flatten most tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the portfolio of the RPG into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent in their letters.
The special switch for the new rentals in the customer center has been open since 18 November.
“The action runs for a little over a week, that is, it’s only the beginning,” the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of hesitation as the “client” unfolds as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ homes are a breaking theme.
Before the elections, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s parliamentary vice-president Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, who is from Ostrava, had raised this issue quite loudly, no wonder the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a beb. Toilet goggles they were able to replace," says the man air mentioned at the beginning.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mostly on the switch to see if they really get the promised rent reduction, which RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease until December 15, are also expected to benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded by demand.
“Of yesterday’s 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rents were due to this in 2011,” the switching officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements both on its websites and on wall panels, where it seems necessary.
If the parties do not agree to the new lease, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG explained on its website.
“No one’s going to court here,” says one of the RPG Byty employees and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least partially the right answer.
"I have 13,000 [crown] pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he said.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"To see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic by New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the negligence criticised by the tenants of the housing fund is in the opinion of the main owner of the house.
While RPG was able to invest $4 billion in apartments from 2005 to 2010, it is estimated to be $5.2 billion in four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red-lighting information emerges from time to time.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and a month," reads the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase rents by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the increase of extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not push rents upwards, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes a further commitment: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in thermal savings - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
But - above all, these people should benefit those who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects looked in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known Brunner buildings come, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-garden.
Most of its 90 employees (inside) are in the babyboom age and the company is committed to ensuring that the project aunts and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
Building engineers and architects find it so much easier to put their demanding profession and childcare under one hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they managed to earn funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-kindergarten is financed through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies amounting to CZK 2.8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be purchased and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified personnel and for the operation.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini kindergarten for a further 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a full year, with the company Economy Rating providing effective assistance in the processing of the application.
The children are taken care of by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children can visit the kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since it is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, however, the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is about individual education and care, the program content in the mini kindergarten is still comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, in addition they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus eliminate the stress in the delayed pick-up of the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents are making more productive use of their working hours.
No wonder natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also being formed here.
Arch.Design has thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric owl, the staircases like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are shattered fish mounds.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms received the nickname "Bone House".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the shale-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s youthful style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living things.
It is only with closer observation that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade appears even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same swinging lines and convex shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood replicates the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even eyelets and bars.
The Batll<0xC3><0xB3> house in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No. 43 was built by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally consisted of the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but eventually he agreed to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
The rental house Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on its zipper that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade was his idea.
However, many other painters and artists also contributed to the design of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> house in the Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Shortly after its completion, the house received its organic forms from the local inhabitants due to the nickname "Bone House".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "walking house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But also other pictorial elements symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
A bit bizarre already encourages their 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> consistently ignored all the construction regulations of the time and did not let any of them be misled.
Before the start of construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so dissatisfied with the result two years later when it was completed that they asked for remediation.
Among other things, the councillors also encountered the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public civic ladder.
There were no changes, however, on the contrary - just fifteen days after the district's request in this regard, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> submitted an application for approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner of the house himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a meeting room, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey building runs a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
But Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, and so a larger society could comfortably chat without having to give up a certain intimacy in more intimate conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two other floors thanks to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s renovation, in addition to a new facade.
Also impressive is Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is decorated and the lighthouses.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum level of light.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The owners of the house decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this is a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, yes, they were also extended to other common areas and the attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rest? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattress and rust make the good bed.
However, these need to complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattresses and rust are subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation ducts in the core and are still lying on a solid plate, moisture is added: so it is not excluded that it forms under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be unable to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“Almost all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they couldn’t sleep here properly.”
"For their shuffled shoulders, heels and hips, they just need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these also to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That’s why many ice hockey players, but also other customers, have been worried about these mattresses with visco foam (Memory Foam) years ago.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This “miracle” actually works.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it fits right on the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, at night you don’t roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wundbrand).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman who are 180 cm tall need a bed that is 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of bed width, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are suitable.
Comfort halfway and also for potential visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, the master of the upholstery and room exhibitor, who for years has been concentrating on the problem of the problem of the sleeping of the migraine and the earth.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the mold layer and the fine pad.
"With your hand or when setting back you must not feel the springs in any case," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattresses and bedding, such as mattresses and mattresses, have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not be ventilated and the cover can not be washed, which is already going on today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a giant (and clogged) sieve after five to seven years.
That’s why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years for mattresses, and even a lifetime warranty.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: for mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with round zippers today, so that you get two halves after opening (immeasurably important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often has to be carried out, like the uneven fight between David and Goli.
Do they have a solid plate in the bed instead of a roast?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if they are not already inside) and use mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket springs and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable lattice grilles with 14 to 18 spring strips (latex or sandwich mattresses, if any, also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay off rusts with a greater number of lattices, i.e. 28 or more spring strips, with the possibility of regulating the Lord's support in the lanyard and the lapel area.
Adjustable laminate grilles do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also available.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which allows the spring strips to be pressed in or even angled in such a way that they allow the shoulders of the sleeper to sink punctually.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even manufacturers of mattresses that have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "man's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rost with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like it, for example.
In the lateral position, the head cushion (along with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their blends.
Even with mattresses, the new magic word is "bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used to make polyurethane foams - for example, castor oil and soybean oil.
Soy is used by all known manufacturers.
“Bio is the essence of mattresses made from purely natural materials,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also use microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent when you sleep.
Here, too, we make a difference between a man and a woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used in men so that the mattress cover can absorb heat and cool the body, the covers have a "warming" effect for women.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes comfortable when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have to pay 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower value-added tax as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this benefit.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
From time to time, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco-foam memory hidden in the case for 11,990 CZK.
The second one is available for free.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were designed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it solidifies itself in turn.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
Fear of their own children is growing, and more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to drive for cars, can locate people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases, as recently when the nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1> disappeared without a trace.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box but soon it should not be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka in fear and fear, and so they look for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairing their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Tschechische market.
"I admit that there may be abuse of such devices in individual cases, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing it, but we haven't had such a case recorded so far."
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out, however, that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply drains from him.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
“Although the phones initially had high expectations for the parents, they can be turned off just as easily as these new surveillance devices,” says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper almost always checks if the child has any electronics to locate it."
“It’s the phone today.”
"If such monitoring devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
“In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead,” says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclination gauge is integrated, that is, if one falls down and stays motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech claims.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play a special software.
The problem with the current location devices is that it is either devices in the size of a wooden box that resemble trailers or smaller phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, therefore, in the present one tests devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a surveillance or location device.
"Or he only notices that after a certain time, which gives the police a time-out," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle belt.
So for the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole of the Czech Republic but you could only hold it for two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, with explosives being ignited.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cords to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have been fighting for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the joint-stock company STV Group, a.s. for lip 40 million crowns.
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cords, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cords annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnics, the MF DNES spoke about it, it follows from this statement that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and Pu sisters.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are no exceptions.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be justified halfway.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of every new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is completely sufficient, then the army has, through these new purchases - even in view of the increased need of pioneering and special units - a reassuring supply of 22 years.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises are severely limited due to the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I also don't understand why they buy so many ignition cords from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a retailer would like to meet most," says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, sales manager of the STV Group.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cords, with the army thus covering itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cord and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, but who wants to remain unnamed, so as a soldier not to be watched for criticism at the army.
After the expiry of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition cord.
“They cost us sixty percent less than last year’s 244-kilometre delivery,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said in a statement.
For comparison, the annual consumption of firing cords by pyrotechnics of the police, who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army, has exceeded barely 1,500 meters for some years.
And the police are always ordering only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the expiry of the period of use.
Due to the safety of the pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords remains open.
The Ministry of Defence has had enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics, who claimed MF DNES, the Czech military expects in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cords, which it has bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day I have found the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun's successful placement in the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition helped him sell his hotel's franchise.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year".
The story of his success inspires like a film scenario.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that in Liberec there is a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he got a construction house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time upset me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment was rented to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested the entire profit back into the house, which he then reverted step by step to retirement with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of business activity in Liberec, he managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another excellent hotel was added.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotel franchise have already signed up,” says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"A large share of this license sale to operate hotels had just won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," Mr Pytloun said.
The victory brought him greater fame, and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they often even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that it did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend anyone who wants to do something to take part in this competition.
You also don’t have to win right away, every sighting is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances to which it would not have come at all.
“With some of the people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day.”
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also strikes a bit down on each of his employees.
And there he is at seventy.
“I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that will be given general recognition.”
I also really see this not only as a personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is only slightly in the foreground," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my followers a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition, Farmet has the worst of it.
Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the owner of Farmet, received the prize for the first rank of the Vodafone Company of the year competition last year.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts with which he stamped a company from the small tool building in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice, making hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encourages me, but also all my employees and has strengthened our confidence in the fight against competition,” says the winner last year.
At the beginning of Farmet’s corporate history was the effort to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered to his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop for the lease as compensation for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate, let his career in the company in which he was employed until then, soaked up and founded a company with a few comrades of his father's own fireworks.
Shortly thereafter, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have grown to be the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its mediation that it also entered the consciousness of the non-professional public.
“Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners have also begun to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to add more value,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year at Farmet, however, was not only in the sign of victory euphoria.
The valuation was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis, which at the time shook even less citizens, but above all businesses, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
“Returns went down by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even reach layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures as well.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
At one, the company was unwilling to make cuts - in the investment in research and development.
“From the grant we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won main prizes at domestic exhibitions,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All this shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
An opinion poll that cleans up with pointless regulations
The opinion poll on the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the Entrepreneur Competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
As the dubious winner of next year’s “Absurdity of the Year” poll, the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online advanced.
So more than a third of less than 4,000 entrepreneurs voted.
Thus, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require excerpts from the trade register in the future when checking social security payers," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take into account all regulations and regulations, to fulfill the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to lift the nonsense.
This is already the fourth time this year that it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organized by the Czech Economic Newspaper (HN) and is enjoying increasing popularity in the public.
If last year the three thousand people participated in the vote, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to impede the business activity.
“In terms of the number of income tax forms, for example, we are taking a leading position in the world,” notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Trade Operators of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has barely improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company conditions, a ranking of eight places worse than the previous year.
The contest Absurdity of the Year was first proclaimed in the year and takes place each year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of the competition.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz is used. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and allows the public to vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz via the Internet.
It defeats the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than one hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and regulations have already been registered for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay a toll for highways and highways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The opening of the competition in Prague Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs a knot between their legs, there can be no real economic revival, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which today still unnecessarily complicate the entrepreneurs' undertakings," Martin Kocourek told the Minister of Industry.
Efforts to make senseless arrangements out of the world show effect.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the obligation imposed on the entrepreneurs to inform the trade office at the site of their permanent establishment three days in advance of the intention to drive to an exhibition stand or cherries.
This obligation has been lifted by means of a novelle of the Commercial Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report service trips of employees up to 30 days to the Office - was abolished by the so-called "Green Card" law.
And - all good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen, which required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two people scales in the speaker room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to refrigerate dropped.
A New Category Recognizes Socially Responsible Companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth anniversary of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair entrepreneurship.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafone, who is "the announcer and guarantor of this year's competition.
To mark the first anniversary of this year’s special sub-category of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fined enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, it is about people with disabilities, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady also provides exemplary care for its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the context of this competition, they were awarded the Vodafone company of the region in the year.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a running and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We are trying to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our business and administration on the environment as much as possible,” explains its managing director, Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, in turn, is based on the health of its employees and that is why it has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, in addition, it promotes the services of employees in the home, in the workplace, and in the company promotions they use in caring.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a c<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD>" from the Karlsbad region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
“We are giving our employees contributions to the catering, the work path, the improvement of their qualifications and the holiday,” says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> from the construction company Czasch from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, the winner in the Mauritian-Silesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year, all Vodafone Company of the Year competition district finalists were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were therefore not disqualified."
“Separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a sub-category of the main competition company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests at a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media businessman and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was led off by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition currently taking place for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the plots offered in the competition were suitable for a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this time, I can only confirm that the police are chasing a person for the crime of fraudulent acts in a public competition," said Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Pilsen public prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo", she could not give further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was again fired by the police.
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate about it in light of the scarce official information.
The spokeswoman of the ground fund Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> referred to the issue of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo, the police actually made arrests at the Pilsen site of the ground fund during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not one of our employees,” she said.
According to Ms <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public competition had the correct name "Call for the award of claims for transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show an interest in the land on offer.
"These persons offer, within the framework of the request, a higher value of their claims to be reimbursed by the transfer than the declared value of the property."
"According to the offered claims, the order of the potential buyers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the land to the person with the highest bid," explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. evidently had information available about who had applied for the request and, since he was a self-employed person since he had purchased a number of refund claims, he offered a property interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat find.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has had very good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
Thus, he also played a role in the case of the former head of the Soil Fund V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankota, who was prosecuted by criminal law because he issued land in replacement restitutions on which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At the time, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. also acquired land from the Soil Fund, for example, which was intended for the construction of public roads, in particular, at the place where the construction of the access highway to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged it very favourably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At the time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart to not jeopardize the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs increase by a few hundred per month
Households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy from January, but also higher water and wastewater charges and rents for district heating and some places will also grow.
Families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month from the wallet as of January.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places you will also tax the district heat supplies.
Electricity management alone costs the households a few hundred crowns more per year.
The high electricity prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, so it is due to the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
While gas is only becoming moderately more expensive, this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too, a few hundred more crowns a year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Particularly larger locations are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové from January have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for district heating, more than 1000 crowns more per year for families in Liberec.
In turn, the residents of Prague are threatened with 9% higher water and sewage charges, in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage fees are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous increases in rental prices are expected in 140,000 rental apartments, for example, where from January the so-called rental regulation will disappear.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase will be interested in the company’s judicial interest.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, except for a good whiskey that you stole from your father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, according to which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen most often need to be treated badly.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is based on the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of children’s departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
“Today’s trend is clearly hard alcohol,” said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the head of the children’s department at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Clinic in central Bohemia.
"Whisky, if it manages to get the father a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
“Wodka has the advantage that it can be mixed with juice, then it doesn’t smell that strong,” explains the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> gives him the right.
"It's mostly about distance or rum."
“This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools.”
"Individually, it was also about Slibowitz, which you take with you from home," Ms Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital admission are no longer an exception.
Before the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since that year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Her career began at the age of 12, when she was first delivered with 3.5 promille of alcohol in her blood and yet in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor said.
Precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance for starting with their own triggers is considered one of the main causes of children’s growing alcoholism.
A real dependence in the true sense of the word is not the case with children, according to experts.
“Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol, along with all the related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children.”
In those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to Motol hospital spokeswoman, Ms. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, up to mid-November about forty drunken children were introduced to the local department of paediatric and youth medicine.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which required a hospital stay, are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, if necessary, by the police, are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink only one bottle of snacks in the school bench, there are, in the opinion of Mr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, three seasonal amplitudes on which one hundred percent depends: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sorrow because of the bad testimony or out of joy for the holidays."
"On Walpurgis night, I've already seen seven drunk children at once in the recording," Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n emphasizes.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better at it than a child who only has to struggle with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning after that, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be eliminated in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
“They’re definitely better at it, because after the ‘great’ experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without hurting anywhere.”
“They’re just a little confused about where they are,” Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n admits, sometimes ruining the patient’s mood by telling them the cost of treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an emergency bed come well and like to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have used this over and over again as an educational tool when I have directly pre-calculated to the children during the visits what their intoxication has cost and that it may well happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fete," added Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regression procedures to demand the costs necessary for the healing of drunk children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two of the five L-159 light fighter jets exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
Until now, they were only seen at maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
When it physically dispatches the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seat fighter jets, in turn, were separated from long-range aircraft without any further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1s have been replaced in their current state and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
He added that the army will not have to cope without two-seat fighter jets, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four superfluous L-159s to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to enforcing the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
“The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the buyer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter of the customer how he realizes the thing," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The Economic Newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for SEK 3.5 billion had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
At the time, the Department of Defense had not issued a procurement procedure, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange will support the future export of the L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech Army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only used 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft is also likely to have a legal implication.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice, which is why it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last of which is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as familial health burdens, added Mrs. Eeles.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in Britain tracked more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
In men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and in men up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are formed already at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the study was known to him as volatile, but he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk "totally proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and walkways there is usually heavy snow, the winter servicemen were on axles all night in many places.
The motorway D5 between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At mile 91, a truck crashed, at mile 93, two trucks crashed, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the road.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks have also crashed here.
The drivers should leave at km 190 behind Brno or drive over Brno and take off at km 182 at K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
This is where a mile-long congestion occurs.
There was also an accident on the D11 and the same happened on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autopilones are formed, for example, in the borough of Prosek, also the road <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff meets.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snow restrictions.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> is closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia can only be driven with increased caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, three side roads are completely impassable, in the vicinity of Brno there are some snow weavings and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow-freezing on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are still three streets completely blocked: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here too, you will need to use snow-freezers for snow clearing.
When they will be able to be driven again, it cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, caution is advised in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert sprays for conservation reasons, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimetres.
In the Mauritian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, the snow is slowly stopped.
U.S. soldiers have a new “smart weapon”.
For the first time, U.S. troops have deployed a new “intelligent” weapon in Afghanistan, known only so far under its codename XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are laser-driven to the target with only a few meters of accuracy.
The special rifles of caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing high explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed so that they can explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic runway.
That is, you can use them against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from the top, so the murderous steel splinter rain from the top can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat weapon is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes like this: he visualizes the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact target point after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to press it.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"If you press down, the gun charges and fires the shot at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
Fujitsu is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workspace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
Japan’s Fujitsu Group is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurter Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, 100 more jobs of the group should be accommodated there, which so far have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large office space in the Astro Park is better suited to the way the employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
Bernd Wagner, Managing Director, said: “With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is especially important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt-based economist Markus Frank (CDU) said he had once again won a "Global Player".
That's a "great location statement."
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impetus for downhill cycling.
Bad Homburg mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course we have offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader.
In the end, economic reasons would have given the outcome.
Now it is about preventing a long empty space in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building turns out to be cooperative."
Fujitsu’s previously used house on City Hall Square and the adjacent “Little Verticals” with the rest of the buildings on Marienbader Platz were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both due to the massive reconstruction of the areas used previously partly as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens, took over the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Konuzer is the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is located in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex – the name plays on its star-shaped floor plan – the central association of electrical and electronics industry has its seat, among other things.
Amazon Blocks Server – Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic letters.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly living in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is getting more and more under fire in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
US Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s flagship list, is set to stay in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks repelled by Amazon servers."
“Free Speech in the Land of the Free,” the revelation activists said on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon had banished Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when the secret diplomatic depeches were released in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks went on to say, “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had hired investigations, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier given the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless act puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe," the senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s flagship list.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian in the UK is known for his exact location as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls for an assassination of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly afraid for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Head of Government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, an exchange of blows broke out.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's resignation if she was responsible for recent espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The White House said it had appointed Russell Travers, the deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that became necessary after Wikileaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to examine the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be endangered by the release of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if that is necessary."
The Ice-University
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest intake and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatoes and from the gelatoio.
The gelato, in German a bit old-fashioned as the ice cream maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice cream maker art.
The gelatoio removes the ice cream from the refrigerator with a spatula, pours it into the wafer and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, does not come past the "gelato university" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest intake and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the home ice cream dile.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just venture onto the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice-cream.
Anke from Berlin is a company consultant and after years in a nerve-wracking job wants to do something of her own.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice skating dilemma in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelato Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also silky smoothness and good consistency.
In his training, Luciano also does not forget the scent of the national and Southern overlay: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano turns the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which with an electronic program heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all types of milk.
Immediately the lecturer is overwhelmed with questions: Can you make ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation go free?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the time.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar core flour from guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will collapse into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice cubes.
Certain variations on the ground mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which turns into yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now the participants are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano allows them to make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream – with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also carried out on the fruit varieties.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - tasteful this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream makes the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture will properly highlight the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winners thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, tables make computing easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only the device for the automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mixture is whipped creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small panics do not go away.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his classmates cling to fruit puree from top to bottom when the oversized rod mixer gets out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Controllers in dim light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) has been immigrated by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbying association for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been a major contributor to the EFSA testing regulations for genetically modified plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The EFSA regulations are word-for-word similar to Ilsi’s position papers and thus mislead the industry’s handwriting, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has faced a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-level EFSA manager recently became Syngenta without a mandate or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group - and has thus changed sides.
The Central German Broadcasting Corporation (MDR) had also recently revealed personal connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians illegitimate.
However, the EFSA cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of the industry, is relied upon as long as they are of high professional quality, it says in a statement.
The experts working for EFSA do not require that they have no contact with the industry.
You would have to disclose them.
Kuiper presents his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn does on the field," Then says.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, then how do you find them?", Then asks the accuser.
That’s what Angelika Hilbeck looks like.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as is the case in the United States of America.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the Tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators were touched and had begun to break down a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the station’s billion-dollar deepening.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, aged 43.
He's secured a couple of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't disappear."
He whispers, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled like a cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the chips.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought everything that happened at the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame they would be grinded to shovel or disappear in the warehouse,” he says in his office, a wooden broom that was once a guardhouse.
He was smuggled and threatened, he says, when he was in the newspapers in September, that he bought the rest of the northern wing from the break-up contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21s for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the tear.
And if it happens, then it would be the most sensible thing if the stones were to be used again.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the average 80 kilograms of squares, priced 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, homeowner.
They had come from everywhere and had towed away, which could carry luggage and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of the impact have long been transformed into "muurle" or into limits of herbal beds.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
“It would not be the political component.”
He gets into his off-road car, making a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied Jura and broke up, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones are stored.
He gathers his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antiques dealer in the republic.
He's slowing down.
In the snow there are artificially preserved sandstones.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elephant sandstone, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the road through the forest.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And go on.
"Beautiful Travertine."
The quads once belonged to the Tribune of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police station, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones used to be carved by hand and moved with simple cylinder strokes and bull carts, he becomes quite frightened.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shake something like that."
He didn’t become rich, he didn’t become rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, besides having settled up in the woods stone smiths, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual valuer.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent Struggle for High Potentials
There's a good android on the buffet.
16 students press for salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are going to learn about the car of the future together with VW developers – and get to know Volkswagen next door.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going into close combat and, like VW, are betting on collaborations with universities.
Your mission: Recruit the most talented graduates in the auditoriums as early as possible before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities don’t publish essays about the performance of their students, they try to train the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group promotes the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber beads and folders with VW logo.
She tells the promising young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and gather experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who will be in question as an employee."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
It's just that it's so offensive for the students to be bullied.
"Lastly, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a wide range of applicants.
But they have to praise themselves and especially for high-skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even larger according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes complex recruitment events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cutting-edge hunt where participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students will be sent across the U.S. next year.
At the same time, participants can see KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of many applicants flies to the United States.
As the high potentials at the universities are being raised and stitched, the shots are increasing, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing tour was too little for us."
For talent hunters, Dykta seems to be paying the bill.
"We have been in contact with all participants of a similar action over the past year."
“Some of them are just about to graduate and want to apply with us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct bullfighting on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go to the pierch very classically at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“About on the intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, chief of staff at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the youth problem.
Currently, 35 jobs are posted on the company's website.
“It’s very difficult to fill vacant positions.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to get in touch with the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give clues that you can do internships with us or write his thesis."
Expensive promotions are not recommended by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote for itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“This is often not something that a large group can offer,” says HR Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good boarding opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual list of best German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Personnel manager Stübe also hopes to place some plus points with job seekers.
“I think that applicants especially look for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients on more authenticity.
And that means, according to Krieger, above all internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, internal employer branding is called employer branding within one’s own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat his people well and identify them with the company, then they would advertise to their employer all by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with gangs," Kriegler says.
Obama to stop new oil drilling
Before the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been passed by the government in Washington - and thus revoked its previous plans definitively.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the first time.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is expected to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster, which cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil deliveries from abroad.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf has not been definitively clarified to this day.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which faces billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which had been called in after numerous corruption allegations, is being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the volume of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of the oil and gas industry,” said the result of a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO – even before Wednesday’s drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is Burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of run out of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoni country.
People are living from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means it well.
“Don’t get rid of it,” the eco-activist reassures the journalists: “You’ll still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to lighten a boy smiling to his chest in the water with the slits surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene almost looks pretty.
The fact that brown oil shales float beneath the surface is not visible.
In the past, she collected shrimp here, Esther Badom tells us on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the running water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil poured out of a brushed pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to roam for six hours to get into fish-containing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the world’s worst devastated regions.
On the way through the mangrove swamps, which are traversed by river runs, the entire extent of the excavation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat swells brown breezes, who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees sprout like black liquorice sticks from the ground, sadly leaving individual palms to be found hanging their prey.
Bird warmth, as is common in wetlands, is found in vain: as soon as the outer border is silent, ghostly tranquility spreads in the former paradise, smelling like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement of Ogoni is a battlefield fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded here, where in the 1980s, the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa organized himself with the later executed writer became the first resistance product, we had to become the 1993 Shell-Konzer.
Even today, the company is forbidden to return to Ogoniland: while from the entire delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines, more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily, the oil fields in the coniferous region of Ogoniland are broken.
Every few hundred meters rise steel frames like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion liters have flown into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil as it plunged into the sea before Alaska – one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history – in the accident of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago.
Who is responsible for the ongoing Eco-GAU is disputed.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set significantly lower security standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner sued the group in 2008: “The rate of defects in the lines alone is “much higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oily workshop under the open sky, the mangrove shapes appear: they are split night and oily to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with pipes, some of which are arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later it drops at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel <0xC3><0xA0> 300 liters per day: "That brings us 34,000 naira" - about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refining plant.
Illegal chefs can still beat the ridiculously low diesel price of just under 40 euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for nothing.
It comes from “bunkers” who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: in this way, according to experts throughout the Niger Delta, at least 16 million liters of crude oil are lost daily.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisionally stored raw material is being processed illegally: the lion’s share is filled with organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, in tankers and swarming it on the world market.
The debate about whether the environmental disaster is more due to the displacement of the population or the lax mode of production, activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had they not destroyed the fishermen’s livelihood so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell has been so shattered that only a withdrawal from the group comes into question: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese will turn out to be better.”
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the Special Forces Unit, they are not threatened with arrest, but probably with a painful lubricant.
The soldiers mainly from the northern part of the country, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
“This goddamn stuff has put our country on the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators Detect Dangerous Construction Defects in A380 Engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction fault that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure" when investigating an emergency landing machine.
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the missing Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much more fortunate than before: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 machines during its investigations – and is now warning of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect could have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, according to a statement released on Thursday by the ATSB.
This could have led to “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Affected were engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and the support surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue was considered important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left three of its 11 A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine in an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall causes traffic jams
Germany all in white: During the night, snow fell almost all over the country.
On many roads, chaos prevails, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowed on Thursday night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east are partly 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but the constantly rising snow was not finished.
In addition, fierce beetle swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The German Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, the snow storms on the highways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to Meteomedia, the alarm level was therefore violet in Saxon Switzerland – the highest level at all.
Partly there was 30 centimetres of snow, fresh and strong winds caused us to be weary.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there overnight.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind led to heavy traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the rails, fallen trees on the rails, or destroyed overhead lines and dams are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firefighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snowstorms swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snowstorms lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Centre, several cancellations have already been reported.
According to a spokeswoman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
On many roads, there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening a truck driver died in the collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The locomotive driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here too, a truck was caught on a railroad crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crashing her car on a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be loose and dusty, and therefore already weird with light thunderstorms.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is haunted by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes on the basis of a spokesperson.
The spokesperson did not state reasons for the planned sale.
“We always check whether it makes sense to own or sell real estate yourself and then rent back,” he said.
With this, Germany’s largest credit institution is relocating its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only acquired the double tower in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from investors of a home equity fund and subsequently extensively refurbished it.
The energy conversion combined the data to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the scattered miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be saved because the security situation in the crash is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were deported for days.
A probe had been dropped into the crash pit, but had not discovered any traces of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the buddies.
So far, the bodies have not been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered with a commemoration of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people gathered at a radiant sunshine in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
They kept quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set, on which were seen helmets, lamps and the names of the companions.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags are waving on half-mast.
New Zealand has been hoping that the miners “from the depths of the earth” would come back to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He cannot end with the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was poured into the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also displaced.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, Warrior!
Is Splatter suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-enters old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) gets rid of his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost superhuman forces in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators on the quest for bloody action, just because our hero likes to get rid of rabies.
On the other hand, eye says, as it is actually called, the whole movie about no word, and also the other characters can be ripped to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise, it is silenced and swept away in Scotland’s grimly beautiful hilly landscape, which offers the Viking world the backdrop of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinematographers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice if a movie has multiple audiences, it’s only a pity if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stubbornly refuses to make his works accessible to the arthouse with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the surrounding brain mass and gums.
At the latest, the action fans die of boredom when eyewitnesses, for freely interpretable reasons, break up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem, stuck for an eternity in turmoil and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to float there.
So it is no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a movie rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has earned some attention.
In this film, it is not about dialogue or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a movie-turned fever dream.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly caresses him for a moment of relaxation and slowly strangles him with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unbelievable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blonde boy who stands by the side of his eyes faithfully preserves something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who, for enemies and temporary allies, eventually becomes a warrior from hell, possibly an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps also only for those who are corrupt anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystical film that you can hate and admire, to irritate, excite and amaze.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this - it still allows controls.
At least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets are attacking a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria from midnight on September 5 to 6, 2007.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates River; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quad, hidden in a valley that runs off the power.
According to a briefing by the US intelligence agency CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium, from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties hardly fades.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
Through computer animation, she blended in where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which is a small copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building from close proximity or even the interior.
The reactor had survived shortly before commissioning, it said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, hardly any more is known than it was then, yes, the puzzles became larger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but barely saw any indications that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a “appropriate reactor,” even if they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer replied only lapidar that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The shell of the supposed “unused military building” was quickly removed by the Syrians and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, via a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which may be more powerful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these footage are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - purchased them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – just like the satellite images.
In addition, it forbids the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent about iron.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is in office at the time of the attack, confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "evolves increasingly into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - finally, a serious violation of the IAEA.
The IAEA appears to see three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor as the key to progress in intelligence - and unlike this one still exists.
To date, the inspectors have not disclosed what installations are involved, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., has identified these locations and found a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspects.
It may be located in or directly adjacent to a military base – precisely with this justification, Syria is refusing access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be presold by the United States to explore military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material was transported to and from between the three locations and the quadrant on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
There is, however, "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should have been separated from it later, there are at least plausible assumptions about these key issues.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, was deposited in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have any information about where the dirt was left.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste camp, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, footage from orbit shows that Syria was engaged in groundwork at the three suspected sites and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has hardly helped clear up the suspicion.
In addition, it says in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago prevented the reactor from being destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, for example, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the strongest means of listening to A.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and several of the 35 countries represented there are anything but marked by an escalation.
On the other hand, how a diplomat thinks, "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her yet nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more is not known about it - but that is enough for unrest.
The rumour persists that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee relief agency UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie herself is an ambassador of the UN refugee relief agency.
She is not diplomatic - she already offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be fired as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her screenplay, has given Sarajevo a filming permit after some time - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author herself argues that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, in terms of content, it remains vague.
A second synopsis to the film on the web, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different from the variant "rape victims are linked to torture slaves".
The fact that Jolie’s film actually starts before the war – so much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now you can probably only bring peace to the hackers of Hollywood: by putting the script, like so many before, illegally into the net.
Nothing like the way out here
This evening, it’s finally back to the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheered for joy with crackling loud music, they stammered with their feet.

Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, it doesn’t really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself by diverting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will hold interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a murky feeling,” he says.
“It’s so far from home and I still don’t have a job there.”
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had bucked, sucked her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.

100,000 Irish are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts at the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, it is estimated that there will be 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of revival, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly unsure of the young, well-educated Irish, for whom so far it has only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under 30 are unemployed.

“For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career path,” says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known for six months.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are building a fashion house.
In January, we will continue to Hanover or Berlin for the next project.
O’Donovan’s home is now rarely seen, as he makes extra layers to be able to repay the loan for his home.
“The situation is already a little crazy,” he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm as good as ever."
He laughs a little bit and walks through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well maintained front gardens, in the driveways large, expensive cars park.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent funded by credit.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you worried that the loan might go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea, and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The engineer does not like the whistle-blower complaint that he often hears at the moment.
“No one needs to be hungry – our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island,” he says.
“Working abroad for a while, that’s not the worst thing that can happen – maybe that’s what makes us feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
“After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Reveal the future and just look at how life is going elsewhere.
He has been working in London for a few years now and why should it not work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him a lot these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might turn into a farewell party.
“Don’t blow too many emotions,” he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walk-in party, quite relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly prominent in this year's September and October surveys.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries along the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong break-in last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic crisis in Latin America undermined efforts to achieve more democracy.
This continued during the global economic crisis, possibly due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor have been caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year.)
However, there are significant differences in mood from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of the separating president Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the survey began, many Latin American respondents see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year, but compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic performance is reflected in stronger support for the private and market economy: 71% of respondents across the region said that the private economy is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela retained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although its left-wing president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
In contrast, respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries see the United States as the most influential country, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An electorate
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the electoral helpers who rushed to help the afflicted country.
Overcrowded ballots, multiple votes, ballot papers in the canton, destroyed ballot boxes and intimidation were just some of the problems.
Electoral premises opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had been homeless by the January earthquake, flocked around in search of an option.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, called for the election results to be lifted due to an alleged fraud.
There have been violent protests all over the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "a pretty good choice in many respects".
According to a careful statement from observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, no matter how serious, do not necessarily render the process invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is reportedly committed to the unpopular separating president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected sample selection is scheduled for January.
There is still hope for the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent in the electorate, declares the winner of the by-election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 passports needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Homely in the middle
In the weeks after her husband’s sudden death, Argentine President Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
However, whether she will help her re-election next year depends on whether the visibly sad Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife’s election, often drew up budget plans that did not fully take tax revenues, economic growth and inflation into account.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenues at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez government lost a majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further mutilations.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (in which one parliamentarian slammed another in the face and others targeted the government for bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget is now in place for next year, which will give the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is 11.1%, for example, but numerous private estimates – and wage demands of trade unions – drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and the fight against poverty his main goals, rather than a reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then fined official inflation statistics.
Can Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now take a more moderate approach?
She called on the private sector and trade union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undercut the growth shift due to a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez may want to rejoin Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club donors, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step to clean up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will be politically active even after the end of her term without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has mostly had enough of ecclesiasticalism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was shown to them will be abandoned.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to lift her husband’s many political decisions quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan hold of its big brother beyond the seas?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, took up to elect mayors and city councilors in the five districts. This is rated as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence of Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the vote, and the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the vote share of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were common occurrences in Taiwan such as truck convoys with crawlers, flag-swinging mass movements and barely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face, and Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has impaired the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has provided the KMT with more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not thematic.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time the DPP also avoided pushing anti-Chinese sentiments too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing is first.
It would be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s rule, a new generation of decent politicians developed and the DPP struggled for the voices of the working class and the youth.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate of the DPP, found great approval, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a forge of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this presupposes unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party is offering a “trustworthy alternative” to Mas’s advance approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he stated that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to waive the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP is finding it difficult to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their electoral campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing shear between poverty and wealth.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limited in favour of a re-approach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no more Back.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you show up at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize, now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been surprisingly nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules according to which three artists have been known to perform before the release of the album.
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with their swinging voice and a good sense of pop, radio and Latin music, you can compare Splitting quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose next big success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category.
The album "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category instrumental albums, which was a favorite of critics.
Among Iyers' competitors are "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, in which otherwise rather albums are found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the big group category, so he comes up against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life album "Pathsien" is a good example for bass.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" list for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", which was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" and Ordiem by the Boston Modern Orchestra.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Art of the Sea" from the Orchestra.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute play is titled “Los Angeles” and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandoline artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestral Performance for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Instrumental soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
“The project is supported by many good people – Christians, Jews, Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD>s, and many others,” Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said on Thursday.
“As an American, I am proud of that.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
“There are few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no America anymore,” a commentary said.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at an end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better location than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new mosque, about 2,300 m2 in the Mediterranean style, is supposed to have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is planned to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live from arsenic, among others, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is, in their view, a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two options."
"It needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
“That makes it something very special, even though it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ form of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in Mono Lake, California, grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said report co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery of extraterrestrial life could act.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planetary systems can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we think are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," explained Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences at the Mileagen University of Ke Space Research Institute.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another,” Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element by the other.
“The toxicity of arsenic is primarily due to its chemical behavior similar to that of phosphorus.”
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
“But the difference is so big that arsenic works differently than phosphorus, it gets into our biochemical system, where it lubricates almost everything,” explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the GFAJ-1 bacterium to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to assume that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other Stolen Exhibition Dogs Found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibit dogs that were stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.
The four exhibit dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is, the dogs are on their way,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
“They were returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore did not provide precise information about the location of the dogs nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still ongoing."
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore explains.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rumored dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were this weekend due to the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace was due to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s almost one-month dog show to dog show tour.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs – a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany – into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder's reward. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder’s salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM now finally got a green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "preparing" creditor plan to settle the $5 billion debt and pave the way for new films and TV shows to the 86-year-old entertainment company.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will only come into effect when JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million planned bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself makes $75 million, manages the company. The financing is expected to be by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with an order for investment bank Moelis & Co, the company’s management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial problems and pay out the studio’s more than 140 creditors lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company to buy.
However, the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all began as the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which, after months of debate and internal disputes, was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM has officially gone bankrupt in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the company’s management, receives a $4 million “success bonus.”
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM, and this year the studio released only one film and created an annual schedule of seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also planned two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose biggest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can crack a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three national toy dealers in search of three electronic toys under $80 - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into effect, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous of these types, Webkins and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattle, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as sea pigs, who sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, by repeatedly pressing you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you’ve started pressing, you can’t stop.
For a combination of envoy and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on last year’s Elmo Live technology, the animatronic doll offers alternating games like ‘Simon Says’, and thanks to the new kind of hinge feet with wheel blocking, it masters the Moon-Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but her parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember for sure Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he’s back (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can be used to make a car ride to a class, with a better one with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as the ones on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is newer than ever, according to Leapfrog.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a punched wooden box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised lettering contest.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores on your own, Webkins and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
These can be roller shoes or a puffle fabric animal.
The latest head-cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an erroneous garden out of clutches.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped across an urban square, checked his nervous subjects, and issued orders with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan – China’s sturdy guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrariness and their attachment to violence – to impress the viewers.
"Just stand up!"
"Look straight up!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls they are!"
Four girls, barely growing up as a teenager, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps are in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white stripes.
"For me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarks insignificantly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green ones.
In central China, Wuhan replaced violence with low-starring: in 2009, officials reportedly circled a malfunctioning imbiss wagon and stared at the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the city’s police ranks and have been selected special because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are to give a softer, feminine aspect to the brutal police.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commands.
That’s right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce city laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his cell phone as they launched a protest against a garbage disposal.
Last year, a training manual by Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered from a handful of five officials with brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleanup".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women should have real tasks or just serve as optical distractions.
Probably both of them.
According to job ads, women between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "harmonious facial features" were sought.
They should be above-average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the age of 26.
According to officials, the activity is too physically stressful for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
“Women Chengguan are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but they also have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of city administration of the district, does not wish to comply with this description,
However, he admitted that in China, size requirements in job ads for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same is true for uniform facial expressions.
Whether this is to be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or buckligens here," Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pie and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel that she was sexist, that such a great value was placed on her appearance.
"Do you find me looking sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the graves, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their data, they do not regret the short-term approach, as they would have more ambitious career plans than just scaring traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strips deal with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on bike before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you this so often!" explains Fr. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his pasta kitchen fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to officials, the activity is rather monotonous than strenuous.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure time distribution.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public attacks to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, randalized after rumours circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violent outcry.
However, unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baongguang Square, where female officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the Bürgersteig rather than in a workshop, contrary to the regulations.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials turned their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued on the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripes, stayed behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained in presenting a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
"Most of the time, people start arguing."
Attorney General Will Not Charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the allegations that, following his affair with a former electoral aide and his attempt to lobby her husband against him, the attorneys of the senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the heaviest legal challenge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, who, until the scandal that caused headlines nationwide and shifted a damper in his career, was considered the Republicans' possible presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign’s office announced, he was “highly pleased” with the verdict after a one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that there were no further charges in the matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, and in your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first published in the New York Times in October 2009, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral aides, had engaged in lucrative assignments in order to erase his silence about an affair with Hampton’s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an Ensigns election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton's work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after hiring Hampton's lobbyist.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign’s election team, he was not allowed to take lobbying work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on turn-around lobbying.
According to the published evidence, “it’s apparently a deal and a violation of the turnaround statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are targeting the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said the ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges against a number of teens who were falsified by the fact that we were deported by the media with great interest.
Prosecutors “are obviously terrifying,” said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association “Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington” (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and governmental circles), a group of attorneys, who are various attorneys.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s main defender, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day that he was informed that the ministry would not file a lawsuit against his clients.
Mr. Ensign’s defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments he had made to the public prosecutors in more detail.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the talks between the Ministry of Justice and me, just so much to say: we believe we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop investigations into a separate complaint by the Ethics Group after a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after the company brought Mr. Hampton on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing’s chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was “attacked” by the Interior Ministry over a matter.
Mr. Ensign had also met with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
Last year, for the first time, Mr. Ensign apologised to his voters and resigned his position in the Senate, where he had stood fourth in the Republican rankings.
After he hadn’t noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator said he hopes the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Justice Department very quickly and stop its investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in serving the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire calls attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them stabbed themselves in the collars in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent out their reports of cruel witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape and bed-chained children in a house set on fire.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will face an official end when the court ruling on the death sentence passed by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed lawsuits in court, which state the reasons for the appeal and which the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that due to the intensive reporting of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has become a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of disturbing details that we have been fluent in the <0xC3><0x96>effler's whirlwind.
This objection could lead the Courts of Appeal to address the question of whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“As I’ve experienced during this trial, I believe it’s really a danger if the incorporation of new technologies into the courtroom affects everyone’s right to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes’s Chief Defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, dismissed the appeals by decision last week briefly and blatantly when he said that the New Media would be “carefully monitored” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that certainly wasn’t the last word on this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on famous-reputed cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland-based osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, and said in his ruling that it had given a "carnival atmosphere" in court because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court claims, which consider Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later, may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes being pursued by the general public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts could be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the proceedings fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers present to discuss for years to delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudicial when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had passed the inadmissible way of squeezing the judgement, exposing it as if he had done wrongly.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a hearing they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor’s office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continually rediscovered the flames of emotions over the case.
“Such a day-to-day andrage of media pieps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” wrote the lawyers, “has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Their focus on reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more weighty than reports that are being returned more slowly is a technically hostile view that impairs reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellate courts would often be confronted with the argument that societal and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the Supreme Court ruling of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard’s conviction was lifted due to reporting, and made clear that the New Media required new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents Sheppard against 21st-century Maxwell.”
Can courtesy connect the separator?
After a campaign of mockery and negativity, this week little politeness broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of genuine bilateral cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the session at the end of a period of government in which no decisions are made.
After all, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an observation of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party point-gathering.
The president’s public meeting of the deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect, which obscures the ideological gap that continues to separate members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase – where one is asking for signs of cooperation and compromise from the other, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-run of the party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health, or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Lastly, the November election in Washington voted mildly, at least for a short time.
“No question, the pitch has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse party passions that are dying again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those that are on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is to be expected with regard to the increased unemployment wages, if only because the Republicans can’t afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support the unemployed workers.
After the meeting at the White House on Tuesday, optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that a successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session does not necessarily have to lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012, as pre-fighting, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the creation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who served their formation.
As worried as the Republican leaders may be about being too high on poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to lower government spending and override the health reform.
These partisan lines will already become clear in the first responses to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own judgment, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the commission 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan the official recommendation and they struggle very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama in terms of the state budget, taxation, and health care system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partyliness of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay close attention to the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
In fact, this may be an optimistic viewpoint.
Partyism and polarization are bigger today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than it was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in his time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure example for a far more consistent 2012 election.
In this sense, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that still separate the two from each other.
U.S. document depicts Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it passes some of the bribery money and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the state security service are blackmailing high protection funds so they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical of authority” – takes its share of the money that heads upwards.
The memo, sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was published Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he had been cleared up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous insults against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked for documentation that suggested he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
<0x3E> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. Surveys have found that.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador’s report, individuals are called, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it ‘disturbed’ and to conclude that the government acts more like a clique than a government,” the memo read.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krishna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection) that spreads through the police, the state security (FSB), the supervisory authority (MVD) and the prosecutor's office as well as Moraerrok's office.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands for Colonel Stelle."
"The FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don’t pay, find their business closed very quickly – due to one or another bias.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who went to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, said in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
“It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Across the country, it is estimated, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo of the American embassy, which happened after Moscow time late in the evening, will certainly trigger mishaps within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov may be accused of Moscow’s mistake, there may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems can be solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we wouldn’t have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and leafy walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still reside.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, a UN and Cambodia community tribunal first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Veng, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society more difficult.
“There’s still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they don’t have the power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died of disease, overhaul or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Thailand on the Cambodian border.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN in 1993 led to the country’s first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their devotees no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"You grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The court’s order is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether further acts will be prosecuted beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to alleviate fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district head in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun casts long shadows on the decayed grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court ordered her, she would refuse to go, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
“If there were no more persecution, there would be war here.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer epochs means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything.”
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the Ministry of Education’s High School History Book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people are being convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains, a road overgrown by shrubs and contaminated with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tyres.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the street, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people come here to pray to him,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas – in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus Agrees Not to Gather More Armed Uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s “47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit” of April, which had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012).
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement “a very important, important step” by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How to keep high-enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally capable of weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... We won’t make dirty bombs out of it and we won’t sell it to anyone.”
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
However, a few months ago, Belarus approached the U.S. when it showed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attack was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of weapon-capable uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the agreement, Belarus wants to dismantle its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central issue in the improvement of its bilateral relations and it continues to progress and is essential to that.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaida detainees via Spanish territory to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects documents leaked by Wikileaks and forwarded to the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" (by cable), adding that the former deputy head of government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, was asked to inform the Spanish government about the flight, according to the report.
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which aid to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was indicted, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "had met Zapatero in the distance" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to the intelligence services flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "unprepared", Aguirre reports by cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as these are in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, meanwhile, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents from the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any intrusive or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Department of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly deal with governments,” Aguirre said.
At a luncheon in March 2007, attended by U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely keen on their independence and did what they deem appropriate," he retorted to the Spaniards, saying that his staff had been instructed.
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP’s approach in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from a note that the government of Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, has tolerated or intentionally ignored, will raise capital, even if those disclosures are negative."
The child-murderer admitted that she complained on the Internet about the "mugging" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when it was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician way"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name, she has been in contact with a cousin and at least a friend, both of whom are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand these, one must know their love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship with Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist, in 1998.
It lasted a year.
Shortly after she disbanded her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look at the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who accompanied her even for a week to Palma.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they broke up.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came to work."
“When I told him that, he found it good, but now he naturally notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do and let go whatever he wants.”
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: “This week I’m going to go there, but I’m only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don’t want to lose them.”
She explains that she will take her first child with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone but with my mother," a dubious intention when you consider their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
As she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
“Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, not on the other.”
On the one hand, he is with me and the place he likes a little bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She is talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the baby girl."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See, if he wants, he finds me like that shit."
On the 30th one: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, her current partner, there is one: "He's firing money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked down, and in which she called herself “Mukki, the Prisoner.”
"Terror in Galician (Überschrift)".
The last man who lived with her, a defeated huntsman, declares to have a bit of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners of Justice in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
The duty defender, Carlos Maceda, declared that she could not remember the course of the affair, "and she did not intend to inflict any damage on the Little One."
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and hiding his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high in the elections.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the shift of the vote share of the PSC and the binding of the electorate of the PP - were to continue, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 members of Congress, while the CiU would also win four of them (she now has 10) and win the PSC.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - it currently has three - while the ICV could hold its MP or win one.
However, should the electoral calendar be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will fall in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the language at the balance to bring an end to socialist domination, namely in four provincial capitals and with their majority in 2011: a House of Parliament with 6 members in the City Council of the City of Barcelona.
Both the nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists neither gain a majority nor can rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not inevitable that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, where it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona’s upheaval, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to see a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and strives to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police officers of the Barcelona Police Intelligence Service formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar's car with the P.O.T.T., with the "e-Taibah" (Let.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that with the “Operation Kampai” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda has been “weakened” worldwide and “so their ability to act.”
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda was composed, so that their "fighters" changed their borders without penalty.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also been involved in the investigations. It is not to be ruled out that it will be held in the territory of the EU in the coming days.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested in Thailand) another one was carried out in which Thabum and Kilakan were arrested, along with the Pakistani Ehahan Sihar Sihar Butt and Zeb.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - in particular tourist passports according to the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents will be on the names of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and must have been valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigative circles point out that so far no links have been found between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the perpetrator of the attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent from a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "end of life" command6.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to delay the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas’s conditions in support of his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These will not differ from his regional position, as well as his regional position, and can be compared to the regional position of the campaign.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 deputies she had won on Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable, because the candidate holds an optimistic position from the bourgeois-regionalist party.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders are revolving around Catalonia.
With regard to the PPC party chairman, the PPC demands that, in support of the entry into office, "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to that of the Basque Country - be made between the State and the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for Mas’s entry into office are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
Officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they outlined the damage caused by the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the caregiver who killed at least eleven elderly people during his work.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in the presence of his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to prosecute the perpetrators (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to take action" and the civil law.
The institution must not only accept a loss of social respect because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illness.
The head of La Caritat denies this point roundly, stating that "missing measures could never have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there was no evidence of negligent actions of anyone other than the accused in the dispute."
The man who was already baptized as a "death angel" confessed to eleven murders yesterday and stated that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and that he murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat said the staff’s access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The nurse used insulin injections and sedative cocktails in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients with the death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will show whether Vila was lying and actually choosing a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them bleach, as he confessed to doing with three women, which he had done between the 12th and 17th of October.
In La Caritat, one does not give faith in the caregiver's statements, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders that could be far more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to consider his actions to be successful.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents to the judiciary.
Threats from the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The risk impacts of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and the euro has hardly scored points, which is a cause for concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers to the extent that it collapses, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB must make a withdrawal tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the termination of the plan to purchase government debt as these are ineffective, and for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, with only one week of indefinite access.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the program to buy bonds will continue and provide a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday will be repelled again, and if stubbornly insisting that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, at which the bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of government bonds and the markets collapsed thereafter, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management issued only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be around 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it did not recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers under the bailout plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still lacks sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her speech more moderate in view of the summit of heads of state and government on December 14, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s ninth symphony.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the action plan, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the trichet effect, which is why we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to convert.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get the liquidity we don’t need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should conform to Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now not only the being counts, but also the appearance.”
Just Courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the chairman of the board of directors of the company of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owner of the companies Elen and El Enebro, does not fade.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the company’s slum, will challenge the shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th, at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them “absolutely null and void”. His children will try to gain control of gas – Veciut Wegain – the company’s board of directors.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for corporate services does not appear to be willing to give up control of El Enebro’s bodies in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed to the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which has already been registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderstorm in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The summons of the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to use legal apologies, fraudulent exploits, and abuses of the law.
This argument is the basis for the subsequent contestation of the assembly in order to declare it "absolutely null and void".
The same protagonists, who hide in discrete silence, already unsuccessfully tried to convene a meeting on the judicial path in June.
At El Enebro - a property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right of use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the proceedings for which a date has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been shaped by the speed of surprises and achievements in this exquisite universe.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising pace during the final seasons, at the end of November, everyone was betting on the victory of the Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that Multi Siemens Red Bull put in their hands, creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft, and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industry department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 – Red Bull Factory “in a few hours, almost in real time” can design and execute the changes and improvements that can be detected on the races and tests.
Russworm concludes that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the racegrounds, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull’s team. With powerful EDV systems, they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team can spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory to develop and manufacture its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are severely restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the services of its participation on the racetracks, are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose fame is equal to zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, emphasized that five years ago it was still possible to say that the R&D advances in racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the proportions have changed. The technology accounts for 85% of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDP because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to open 20 stores with local distributors in two years’ time
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a 20-store sales network with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees on this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, HP Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a’s vice president, mentioned the converted shop at the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been cooperating for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are located in Spain.
The first ones were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming reopenings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next goal.
The vice president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, said that the philosophy of opening a store is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises on this and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network intends to "optimise the customer service and consulting of small and small businesses when purchasing and after, and even packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"This way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
“This system has been developed especially for small and small businesses as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service,” said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal one million customers from rivals in three years
Jaime Guardiola, CEO of Banco Sabadell, is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but at first it will create a new liquidity crisis and predict the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a break in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - an area still in existence.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years, and so to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year roadmap in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700,000 if you subtract the customers that the bank will lose - which is more important to their private business than theirs.
This year, it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Private customers have a market share of 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is increased productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual accounts report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has shattered all the plans of the banks worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima roadmap, which was originally designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one fiscal year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At an APIE-organized breakfast, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only "slowly" get out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which will punish the interest margins - will be deflected, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their liquidity issues will already be deflected to the price of loans as compensation for fluctuating profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We haven't turned the cock off, but the interest rates are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to limit the granting of long-term loans and increase the interest differentials (cf. Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also conceded that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie of "increasing fees", however "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s roadmap is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "larger companies are needed."
“In the coming year, everything will change,” he says.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently "extremely increasing" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He is of the opinion that FROB could replace the money market in case of capital increases.
After reassuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put in circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through repo transactions, and thus catch up with the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings funds
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta denied yesterday the possibility of a merger of savings banks, stressing the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the Spanish savings banks started the concentration process, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase; they retained the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was adaptations."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have seventeen or fourteen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, which has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the due process, which was in the past, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco".
"The transition from 45 savings funds with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta stated that "there would be a number of unreported opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed irresponsibility and nonsense" because "the Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a encourages us to conclude by the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" the whole world, adding that those who doubted did so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic downturn, we need to “do not worry” about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a “very significant” concentration process that will be carried out “as soon as possible”.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has proposed new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and small enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 euros of support for unemployed persons who do not receive unemployment benefits, as well as unemployment benefits, and the privatisation of 30 million euros.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as being responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be foreseen that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her publicity work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which collides with the preservation of the traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible escapes from the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German mark – although that currently sounds more like science fiction – is supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a redesign of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict fiscal management; penalties for countries that violate the regulations; possibly the suspension of payments by some countries and the expansion of the costs of potential adaptation measures to private sectors.
The German position is clear and has been declining for some time, so there is no excuse now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out of its sleeves a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country, when Merkel painfully pushed the decision to save Greece.
At the time, this was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable the rescue of a country, while at the same time committing private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it was driving the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was adopted and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which is intended to enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think of crossing.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area in which the countries in conflict will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external economic balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as it was pointed out by Spain in booming times, is simply not going to be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not just a matter of reducing the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
Demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass into more peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us by the spring of 2013.
Zapatero seems to have understood that too, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite criticizing Merkel, Weg has the hypothesis of creating order in her own home.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like it would change anything.
One of the options considered is that we should not exclude the euro area, which is full of countries with few reputations.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and regular walking
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink spilling over whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten but in this sport followed rules.
Part of the debate that arose about the case is due to the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who in his anthem of nobility and honor and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role of provo, and to the dramatization of his character by the long-running Eurinho.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is inconsistent with the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts constitute a rule of law.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the opposing players from taking an unjustified advantage from the opposing team. Nor did it happen.
The paradox of the actions of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by misplay or rule-making, because circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the opponents drew from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was neither brought into a more disadvantageous position nor any advantages were heated for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players begin the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could at some point also rule out. In addition, players with this approach receive a penalty and go into the second card cycle, in which they are less out of balance due to card accumulation than in the first cycle.
Thus, it is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to bypass a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule-making), they preferred to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between the invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provocative rule transmission.
The harm that has been inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offers for Group Christmas Dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations on the 16th and 17th of December.
The celebrations paid by the employees themselves are expanding. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which bring oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry of Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive, also the customer segment, which represents the big crowd and take off the intermittent day, catching between 20 and 20 euros.
In order to make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations at two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay this out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economy is, low prices are demanded, confirms the chairman of Barcelona’s restaurant board, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the roofing association does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it 'ten times before they make a reservation."
“They want to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who “offer quality at good prices with good service,” he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
In a survey of several centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferential reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain last year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQuQu and a total of 23 venues, one does not lose the optimism after revenues have blossomed again since the second quarter and good, albeit concentrated prospects for the Christmas business are faced with a few days.
Sources from the group emphasize that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus, with the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, too, green shoots are seen, which is why the employees are invited again, which gives the impression that the group food is on the rise again.
On the other side of the Fecasarm Roofing Association (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the Vice President, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are generally quite "living", although the customers are "lively".
However, the fun at the celebration did not go away, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concern in the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks’ revelations confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program is causing Washington.
On the brink of clarification and juicy details, which provide documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security will not be strengthened more quickly than any other country to produce nuclear security, but on the contrary, will "take away the ever-increasing Asia."
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program—that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored to make it difficult to destroy in a possible attack—was preparing sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of transport".
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen by the US, but also by Russia as a precautionary measure and a reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan must hire strictly credible personnel to monitor nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," said Yuri Korolev, an expert at the North American Foreign Ministry.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is slowing down and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" declared: "Often there is no transparency; we will not receive answers to offers of assistance or they will be rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, an official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirmed that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit to the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify to the person in charge that "Pakistan's army has to stop its silent overstepping of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorism leader to prevent further disclosures.
Interpol issued a red warning about Assange’s persecution and discovery.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red warning” about the “finding and persecution” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order of arrest.
It’s not new, it’s from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of over four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks founder Mark Stephens' lawyer assures that "the police would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
The order was issued by the international police authority based in Lyon (France) on the 20th, at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authorization from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are tasked with identifying and discovering Assange, "to provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member states, according to the organization's statements, consider the red alert as a release letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement on where they are concerned.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who gestured to publish a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the Swedish authorities’ questions via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and received the corresponding approval from the prosecutor, who is being compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s security chief.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and his mother from Australia pleads for her son's innocence - Assange stays in an unfamiliar place, but not silently.
On Monday, he interviewed the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location, requesting the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to step down,” he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should focus on the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism chief, Russell Travers, to prevent new disclosures of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to give Assange less attention is in contrast to the views that conservative politicians and commentators have expressed these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and to succumb to anyone who supports them."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target disk and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas, and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone who leaked information to the government is guilty of treason, and anything that is not executed is too mild a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is looking for peace in the ERC with a twinkle of an eye
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary principle.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe to get away from the ERC for the ziggest time of an internal riot in the ranks after the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the vote.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the immediate one of the former party leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as her mentor himself and will not break his head.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the start, it was announced yesterday that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could make secret statements about his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss the president’s penal code, they could do so without fear of repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod Proxies demand more from the President than just to provide his office to the Party, an insufficient gesture as Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the highest organ of Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board of directors on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to contribute to the drafting of the Strategic Reorientation document, which will be submitted to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to bail out Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, who, in return, promises to present to Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party leader already believes is a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" harms stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, signed by the current Councillor Josep Huguet in his blog, is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is an ideologue, the owner of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He numbered five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should finally give up the principle of full assembly as a way of functioning.
In this way, he advocates a reform of the statutes that will allow Congress to hold with elected delegates.
Since the end of the plenary model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s' team has been obsessed with how to fight for it at the last two congresses.
In fact, at the 2008 sitting assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the plenary assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date still stands, as the infogle of the internal upheaval of recent years was not advisable to deal with this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors on the line, the time could have come to reopen this issue and conclude it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO calculation, there were four fewer cases in Mexico than in 2010.

Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the previous month of the year, there are a total of 390 deaths, which are believed to be linked to organized crime.
Among the cases is one in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, a place in Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots caused by firearms, the grace shot was delivered to his head, and feet and hands were fastened with a cable.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage canal of the settlement Playa Golondrina.
The ambulance searched for the rest of the body parts, but could not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n reported the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, with their hands tied backwards and their heads tied together.
The man had a wound that came from the shot of a firearm in the neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported murdered, wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza, and two murder threats were found in addition to the victims.
A day later, a human head was found in a carton in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a statement signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning in Huixquilucan was found the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, according to the news, who left his killers next to him.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in her neck.
On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding images were discovered.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape were discovered and a message in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the body was a message, probably signed by a criminal organization, that said, “This happens to those who don’t participate.”
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to their hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n justice center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and smashed in black plastic bags, next to a message. The second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the settlement of Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Next to him, the police found a card with a message.
China Maintains its Goals to Reduce Greenhouse Gas
The representative of China said at COP16 that his country has made huge efforts to reduce carbon footprint and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the past four years to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this issue.
He explained that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building, and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities of the states had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, some multi-year plans have already been under attack or have been completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the energy efficiency programme, which was introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands.
There is also a project on climate change at the provincial level, another to replace traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, the country’s scientific government adviser on climate change, confirmed that China’s efforts would be far greater than generally assumed.
He pointed out that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China amounted to six tons per person, while in the United States there were 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
In the same way, it is making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use, energy efficiency has increased by 20 percent over the last five years and is expected to be further by 2020, he said.
Legal Exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The National Leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party Chairman has the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the law grants him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission for Orders and to demand what the law granted him.
In an interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s appeal as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Commission for Orders in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case to the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he said it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance on the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the municipal elections, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader stated that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not frightened by internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy them and they strengthen us," he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt select the best president or president needed by the Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional for the next three years, so he handed over the relay "to the one the Council would appoint."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open, and I'd be proud to hand over the post of party chairman to any one of the five."
He predicted that the party's surge in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not the time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and aspirations are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
Asked about the criticism of the PRI of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech during his four-year government, César Nava called on the supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government expressions such as those he could make in his speech at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral prohibition and even less censorship.
Obama on Twitter advocates for law for undocumented students
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and push for the passing of this law,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act, a law on the legalization of undocumented students, with a message on his personal blog on Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge the passage of that law,” Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators in a timely manner, as the bill’s vote is imminent.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he emphasizes.
The message was circulated after the 42 Republican senators urged to block all votes for any law, except the expansion of tax cuts from the Bush era and government funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be drawn up for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can come to an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - a law with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, though.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American Dream, would be about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were under sixteen, have lived in that country for the past five years, and have been legal in a higher education institution or at the Armee.
But the proponents of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the proponents of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That’s why the defenders of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most sought-after Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who assumed the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who voted for the bill, John McCain, has not yet determined his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk where the participants made a strong effort to tell the story.
"I understand that with sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle of her talk to others, which he gave to others, she celebrated the Spanish-language under the question.
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentine writer sputtered sweetly to the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to join the Valraez and Monteron to join the Montenegrin, Serr<0xC3><0xAD>o Rahla.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and described Shultz after that as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to find out what is a "wrath", and from doctor to doctor he does not go to doctor. He does not tell the answer to whom she does not think.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists, who robbed her of her breath in the middle of the walk, and who, however, explains that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is really the open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs relieved and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist", but she is convinced that the lust for language and their traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented an enchanting story, which he called 'Lob of the Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With hints of magical realism, he tells the story of a famous wizard who touched the clouds, brought back the men who traveled far, or restored the virtues lost by a girl. The story made a turning point and told about America, he told about Bertitis, the great novel of Berti, to whom it did not tell the story of Caron from the beginning.
“Cervantes, who invited us all [the writers], mocked the presumptuous witnesses who appeared in the stories depicted as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told – with imaginary power that even got rid of the sense of shame.”
However, he emphasizes that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
This is called the ‘Cervantes tradition’.
“From him we have inherited to be what is being told.”
When Mayra Montero was in the series, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl’s invitation to the Round Table “The Finger in the Wound” had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated their contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects their country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unintentionally planned engagement," she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that takes place between the author and the readers as in a "chemical" reaction.
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose contribution also emphasized "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world also the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness run out on dogmatisms, and is forgotten that "there is a small no behind every confirmation and a small yes behind every denial."
In order to possess our thought and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means to put the finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they are in the form of cartoons, in the form of whites, in the form of blacks and whites, to revisit the prefabricated ideas, in the form of the worlds, and in the form of the worlds.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final match, there are also two different styles, specified by their respective coaches, and their encounter with opponents is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he’s experienced ups and downs in his career, but he’s had three crucial games, and so far he’s held well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has won the medal for the second champion, he is one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The sentimental strategist reached the first final as a coach at the Torneo Apertura 2002, when del Morelia had the strings in hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003', he reached the decisive duel, which he also won with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to strike back again, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and won the game three times.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be chased again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title himself for the first time, although he confirmed that this is funny for him.
“I want to become a champion, I don’t want to break any stats, that’s for a club, for my affection, which is why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing,” he said.
"The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee doesn't give an end to it, we can't celebrate it, we're not prepared for it, we're prepared for it, we're ready for it, we're ready for it, we're ready for it, we're ready for it, we're ready for it, we're ready for it, we're ready for it.
To know that this series could be decided by eleven-meter shootouts, or to play these games, does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to come to the eleven-meter shootout, you want to finish something in the regular time of the game, but sometimes there will be no alternative to the shootouts and you have to prepare for it, we have been in the previous tour.
It is in Romanso’s power to no longer just be second champion and to enjoy the glory that the titles bring with them for the first time.
The U.S. is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their meeting with the consulate at the service points for the visa application; the costs will be shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change in the United States Embassy and Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants are required to present themselves before their meeting at the Consulate at the Visa Application Services (ASC, initials in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be checked by the Consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases, since it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, processing the visa application and the transport service with which the document is delivered.
The applicant only makes a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only need to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
As the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate will remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the $26 service fee.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a fund that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The event will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA’s Washington headquarters by experts in astrobiology, a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA assured it would present “a scrutiny fund for the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments that were previously thought to be uninhabitable, and the hypothesis was put forward that they could transform into intelligent living beings — just like humans — if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment that was considered too toxic for all conceivable life forms because the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In some ways, the microbial uses arsenic as a survival resource, and given this ability, the chances of similar life being created on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere increase.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, it has been proven, according to astrobiologists, that "there is actually a different way of life, a second way of life that differs from the one we know."
The space agency will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference, the actual scope of its fund.
The conference will be attended by geologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), studies whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gestas PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n form a block of opposition
With the reform of the Organ Act on Congress, the bipartisan system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and already an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who presented themselves as an independent, had already been installed.
Before the start of the introductory session in the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo protested against the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they reiterated, a "two-party system" would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as the parties that controlled Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency headed by the Panist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionalized their political marginalization with these reforms.
He suggested that in the coming days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, assuming their political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated again by both parties, bringing the opposition coalition to an end.
"Until now I come [the opposition coalition], that's what I see, because we're excluded from all decisions that don't even take into account taking the opinion of the others into account."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia stated that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that Congress, after being monopolistic, is now supposed to be "duopolistic."
“It is not the spirit of the law reform that a perpetual bipartisan system should reign in Congress.”
"For starters, this group starts with five members and they are talking to other colleagues to make them more," the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, in reference to PAN and PRI, stated that the Congress has at present turned into a 'bouté' for two.
“Before it was just one party, now they split it into two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo requested that the Members be respected and given their place at the negotiating table.
"It must not be left out because of top decisions five, which are likely to be nine Members, because the five, which are currently seen as being divided into different factions, have decided to unite in order to reunite with others, and we have not agreed to take our place at the negotiating table."
200,000 Peso more for "the supplier"
The city of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n pays another check to the disputed owner of the company for electrical equipment.
Another check of just over 200,000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year is 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued for an amount of 200,144.56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued on 16 November with the purpose of using "Billing open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had already warned that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditor<0xC3><0xAD>a Superior del Estado because she is sold at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, consequently, the number of checks still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“There was nothing bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "resurrected" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Gazette, as required by law, when a company is challenged by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be re-used.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the examination of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on July 25, it was announced that earlier, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of the mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the municipality had to count to Sch<0xC3><0xA1>ncho with more than 10 million pesos.
Shops were also held with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the burglary of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked to pay special attention to the authorities, the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the trade association of Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions, it was called upon to maintain the destination and to transform the poor conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and walkways would have had a negative impact as tourists came for a stroll and saw the mess, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day, and they don’t think about how much money is being lost, otherwise they wouldn’t be doing the construction in this way slowly and unplanned.”
The hotel owner José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of the tourist would have drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take responsibility and avoid this happening again. How should they do that? Now, through preventive maintenance instead of remediating everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eager to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, but we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration needs to change their strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look careless and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n."
“Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. There needs to be a good product offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire,” he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents represent just what is obvious to everyone: Maintenance is urgently needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Under-Secretary of Promoci<0xC3><0xB3>n Tur<0xC3><0xAD>stica, expressed the importance of saving Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s tourist spots, because they would not be used properly and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be brought together with the city to Vordermann. To make the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism, should be priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural sites that first need to be cleaned up and cleaned up in order to make them attractive for tourism and to supply them with the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take the big responsibility to set an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s business sector is calling for a dignified parliament, free of agreement, which is confusing the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and is facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the various social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and to not repeat the same patterns of partyism and paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, proposed that the new MEPs should take the big responsibility to set an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will truly exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, because it is common practice for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus turning them into carnival compasses of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and work primarily for society and their groups, because it was the Sinaloa residents who expressed their trust in them in the last election.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the hotel association Tres Islas, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and the joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is the most complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation.”
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary role in the state budget to promote it.
"I understood that it is the Ministry with the second least funds, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings currencies and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agribusiness."
Tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislatures, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family longingly.
For the parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next triangular day, because the budget is composed of no more and no less than twelve persons and a goat’s buffalo.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the village of Salvador Allende, where they live from hand to mouth, because the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes hard times are trendy because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Even in the afternoon I go with the gories to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Cayetana proposes clothing in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd love this monster so much,' but I replied, 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe is size 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah is size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the 'Holy King is sought' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 Suspected Drug Dealers Arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network around the ten house inspections were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The home inspections took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where drugs were said to have served mainly.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec’s security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke, the ring’s main wire-targeting men.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could, among other things, be charged with the production of cannabis, its assets for sale, the conspiracy and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that went on for over a year.
"The information obtained from the public hand has allowed us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be easily traced
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says is intended to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret migrants, is expected to be stowed after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
“I strongly oppose this charter.”
"I'm holding on to a party that's got you tied up," said Michael Ignatieff, the leader of the Liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled MEPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as being transported by a seagoing vessel by illegal immigrants, to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
Criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the critics by hand who demand that her party did not behave resiliently enough to covert immigrants.
“The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and that is exactly what we are trying to enforce by passing another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks the blame for the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
“Canadians urge MEPs not to tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a legislator.”
“They expect Canada to take tough action,” said Minister Kenney’s response.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence on its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
A conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that every opposition MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit on the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigative committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, Wednesday’s announcement has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also not lacking in the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit spelled out of the hat" and "a solution rightly cooked at a table".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who feared that the political power would have too much influence on the questionable future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it," he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form an investigative committee is by Jean Charest's resignation," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State College for the Training of Higher Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposes that Quebec grant a special mandate to the auditing authority so that it can conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the examination control," he said.
He is also of the opinion that Quebec could grant the same powers of scrutiny as Commissioners, which would also allow you to oblige the people to make a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the Penal Code in order to better address this type of crime.
This request comes from the Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people had been arrested, although the penal code had not been revamped.
As a result, Ottawa has enacted the Anti-Gangsterdom Act.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several streams remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has erupted in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauritian administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation has erupted over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of precipitation were expected here, depending on the regions, until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rainfall had fallen here.
Since snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the overrun of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebecer Security Service issued warnings about the flooding alarm regarding the rivers Ourareu and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re are subject to flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julianne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was demolished due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains alert and monitors the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec National High Water Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ourareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partially convicted
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians, as well as for his failed speeches on radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their opinion, but certain statements would have "inaccurate information about social security and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion about suicide, which involves the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide, violates the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was lodged following a complaint filed by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide solid than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion that the message conveyed here was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the questionable consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" would have tailored a sensitive subject in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any tadel against his person.
The final point of contention was the statements that had been made regarding the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective dispute in this regard, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he had not donated in favour of Haiti aid, as one would not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustifiably negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already served my three-day suspended sentence in this case."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board encourages the dissemination of an unfettered form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, was to communicate its decisions once during the main broadcasting deadline within a period of three days, are small.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montrealer of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now rising in search of new challenges to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts such as Kung Fu and kickboxing," Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, said in a statement.
I am personally looking for combat everywhere, because for those who do not like ground combat, such as the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the person who worked as a security officer and worked for UPS had given bad news to his rivals, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate Association (Kickboxing) and the World Karate Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
"I have achieved victory in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"It was those fighters from every category who had placed themselves among the top four at the last World Cup."
"I babe brought in 2009 in Toronto bronze."
"In 2005, I became a Vietnamachter."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, this time or next year, I'll be first!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines derived from China, where kicks and kicks are allowed as well as ground throws.
The two fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxer who originated from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal retained only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," the friendly pound skeleton said.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
“The one who beat me was a real professional,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the front to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed on $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a total of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompaniment to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector to take responsibility for this important hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" endorsed the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the recourse to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition as well as an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a discarded game and deterring competition."
“This means that you are now conducting games in secret rather than in an open way,” Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, said yesterday at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to this in the afternoon by vehemently arguing that this contract was a discarded game.
“I remain true to my line,” she said, reinforcing that the PQ had gone “unreasonably” and it “lacked her hardness.”
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise regarding an offer for a call for tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its work size.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competition being able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is by no means an exception to relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief flyby of the Quebecer Business Register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA<0x2B>, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Every link, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
Regarding the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'energy de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has made the nose crumbling about the fact that the contract for project management was approved according to the agreement.
"If you make a bid and there are few applicants, your prices will go up fast."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mars and you say to yourself, you're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte confirmed.
This contract granted to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" had more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known by the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had made it clear that the PQ was equally affiliated with the companies they “financed” before specifying that it was more about their executives.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The "Green" Label Is Not Trustworthy
Greener, but unavoidably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but equally little in the labelled brands or eco-labels that are meant to control his choice.
It is a pity, although it bathes in a media-efficient universe, where it fluctuates with information in favor of more responsible consumption only in this way: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that has been perceived as the brake of its commitment.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to be paying little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population admits that they don’t believe in the company’s commitment to the environment as much as they do in green corporate advertising, according to the measurement tool developed by the responsible consumer center at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the Barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important for stimulating this consumer segment, which is currently invigorated by just about one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the side of the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are distrustful of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mostly changed the brand of one or more products to express their belief.
According to the barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible – the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year – Quebec’s Homo consumus loves to present itself as King of Recycling, who is trying to reduce its environmental footprint by reducing its footprint.
However, social and environmental awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the commuter centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking as well as cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behaviour survey, which feeds on the clichés.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by the Société Angus and the company Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus, as well as the company Parallele, who donated $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to the acquisition of Daniel Langlois’s eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, had hoped not to receive what they had once again been responsible for its actual cinematic function.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than initially expected, which could call for an existential solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources extracted from the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the request has been adjusted downwards again since the request.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who leads the eXcentris Act.
A few days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the Cabinet’s counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallele and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to these questions.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let’s remember that the Quebecer community of cinemas and cinema complexes had refused to make a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial aid to come and did not allow anyone else to provide financial aid for real estate projects there.
However, in contrast, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, Daniel Langlois had for over ten years, with great difficulty, presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception on the part of the Treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clients at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallele headed by Christian Yaccarini, in turn, manage a privately funded campaign, of which they hope a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the presentation of the highly successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des deux".
But Christian Yaccarini has not called off the newspaper "Le Devoir" and you ignore what he and his group think of the downwardly corrected proposals that you have made to them.
The secret of the complex shattered Canada unleashed
The new U.S. diplomatic lines, spread by WikiLeaks, unravel the secret of what the United Nations considers to be inferior to the Americans under the Canadian complex; but with the same blow, they reveal the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not mean the Canadian-American relationship during the election, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly disseminated yesterday, offer even more punctual details than the mere substantive content you have to clamp down on.
A link dating from September 22, 2008, that is, during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participate in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador based in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"An almost intrinsic inferiority complex conditional on Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders much more likely to talk about domestic issues of everyday life than the United States in this election," he writes, "to push over the black Peter's campaign, as in 1988.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this “difficult silence” all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor at the time of entry."
The second expression of this sense of importance is read in the announcement sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, resulting in a $30 to $40 billion revitalization program."
He had nowhere mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the Parliament from falling off the coalition and the continued conditional existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another message, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, understands Washington’s increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or even deductions for the purpose of CIA muscle-propped interrogations.
Again, another announcement details how Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting to see if Europe was ready to take in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he handed over to the Secretary of State a paper on the issue of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again".
Finally, let’s note that the moods regarding the WikiLeaks website are warming up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close-knit advisor, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for the Renewal of Lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, which corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be achieved by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to yesterday’s plan, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of FCKWs emitted due to the illumination of the earth would be avoided if the white-glowing pears, which so far represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would still be fluorescent or better, it would be fluorescent, or LEu.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 GB to 49 GB.
However, from this balance sheet we would have to deduct 5 GB to stabilize the rise of the climate by 2 degrees Celsius from now until 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white light bulbs 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
The compact fluorescent bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, and the new LED bulbs reduce this energy demand by twice.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those brought on the market by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and are expected to consume 80% less energy than a white light bulb.
In addition to the fact that these completely new types of light bulbs give off very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for the producers to provide a pick-up point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulbs, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-lighting bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast is looking forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Election Commission to retain its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesperson for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all parties and institutions in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and abide by every initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results.”
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had left the deadline, which was set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from around the world have become loud, but the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the Constitutional Council to cancel "fraudulent" ballots in the north, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire presidential campaign, had confirmed that the UN's maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo’s complaints are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more of the opinion that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has deemed the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone as far as calling for victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results as he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the election commission from publishing the results was illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been split in two over the years.
The United Nations had warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held accountable in the event of any outcry against them.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as the top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, as defined by the International Labour Office (IAA), is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to preliminary seasonally adjusted data published by the Insee Statistical Office on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and to 9.7%, including the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed, but wished to find a job, including whether they were employable every two weeks or not, whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (<0x2B> 0.9 percentage points within three months, <0x2B>0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the youth between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, in turn, have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (<0x2B>0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the departments overseas.
Only the 25-49-year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, <0x2B>0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion about its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues to use this method, announcing a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Accused and Arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne Region (PS), was initiated an investigation procedure and he was taken into custody in the course of an investigation into the public and fraud-suspected markets of Aceix.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with deprivation of corporate property, misappropriation of public property, bribery, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to express his views on all the questions the public prosecutor's office will ask him, rather than spreading brain spines."
“It’s easy to submit him to a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agency France Presse) before his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had insisted that a memorandum on his justification should be sent to the judge before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A relative of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to lead, running.
With regard to the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have had knowledge, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Balloon Area, was also charged on Wednesday for defamation and accomplice, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision, was again set free.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released from custody on Tuesday night, including two of them under legal supervision, Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) disposal company, is being prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants of the Aubagne Ballungsraum, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the grounds of the title "abduction and extradition of public goods by a public service agent", the other on the grounds of "co-operation in extradition of public property".
Also the life companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "consecration and deprivation of social property".
Among the people confronted by Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested for a similar case of fraudulent acts of public authority that had affected Corsica.
The flag bearers suspect that his company has contributed to the laundering of money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, here in particular in the disposal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 following an anonymous letter in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of the subsidy as well as the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also contains waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the urban catchment area of Marseille (MPM).
Affair Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its role as a mediator for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "spying" kept the French public in breath, put the diplomacy in teranthesia between the alarming sightings and the accentuation of Paris.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper Le Monde give a price for some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on dealing with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman is not the release of Majid Kakavand, a man detained in France and wanted by the U.S. judiciary for the trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea credible, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 bears the title "Iran: French Comments on the Way to Deal with Hostages".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy issues, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything they could to retaliate against their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without neglect" the words "human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do this."
Because “silence does not solve anything”, beyond the attempts to discuss it in an unobtrusive way, the Iranians are “masters in evasion maneuvers”.
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "regular Iranian tactic": "hostage for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will exacerbate itself".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been put into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands to Iran because of the illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, asks questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is tracking Iran’s illegal networks of acquiring the material for the nuclear program.
Did France buy a cow trade?
Liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a renewed conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to resist.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the “strict” supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant picks up a phone number, reposts, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranians "are currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad play an "important" and "influential role" by means of rumours and media organized "refugees".
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much “thank you” to Mr. Assad, the Paris message asks.
"Despite their full praise statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elysée fell short of this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts “target to confirm Sarkozy’s policy of openness to Syria,” he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which was then "perceived by numerous critics' voices in France and abroad as premature and unearned".
"Building the Syrian Role" Paris tries to "lead Syria in the eye of what kind of loyalty you can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to sow “dispute between Syria and Iran.”
The American people know this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier told her: “Of course we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
"But we've thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes them at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called “the ashtray,” which will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill designed to encourage online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of cult and family ministries said.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and also living a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this bill entrusted to the ministerial commissioner of the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m. onwards.
The manufacturing companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government is also keen to ask manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free software to those who wish to make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intense internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints the country of referees
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee, with a clear outcry on suspicion of corruption, appoints the country to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice that threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional high castle (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then look a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of an economic and political commitment.
So the feats behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which only once would have been the next World Cup.
On Monday, the BBC again provided him with food, broadcasting a documentary report that shot three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who had been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a re-issue of the chess move by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in truss with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
Possible repressions against the English, as well as doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a major outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the unavoidable implication on the sightings of the English press "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the committee members.
“You get them with dirt, you try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, reinforced by the 1994 experience, appears to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the 2026 FIFA World Cup for China, which will allow Asian chances to fade to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar pulling all registers in the wake of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk because of certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weak television rights acquitted by European countries (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
The Second Mandate: Disclosure
De Gaulle had really sneezed.
Middle-earth had made him think he was slutty.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well on the side of the mystery attached to the presidency.
So you have to act as if the doubt continues to exist.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chiracs suggested that a third term would not be ruled out without believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometimes in the fall of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians he would make the prospect of "two mandates" sound, had spread a bit of feverishness, he said.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
It's a long way off.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It’s not the first time he’s mentioned the presidential election on such meetings in a humorous tone.
“At worst, you have seven and a half years with me, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next phase."
His words of yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but no less.
If you want to make comments, for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the recording of the competition with Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that Nicolas Sarkozy is driving to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS are urging earlier than assumed to campaign.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to a survey by the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the prime minister's environment reacted directly and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
“He will always believe in being able to win,” corrects Alain Juppé, who has come to terms with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB’s central bankruptcy last year should offer opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the organisation of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of European government debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to no doubt be able to effect even the current more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their aggravation.
The political cost would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the ECB’s active role in favour of resolving Europe’s public budget debt.
It has not dared to say whether it is of the opinion that the central bank could do even more, for example by boosting its program of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the occasion of his hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, had not very much spoken about his projects in the market, but we would rather be pleased to point out that, "in the course of doing so, we would point out that the programme
The only certainty is that the ECB will be left unchanged at its leading interest rate of 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s bond purchases from the Treasury have doubled last week to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, they are said to have made new purchases yesterday on Irish and Portuguese government bonds.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have made purchases amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the traders, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price (see page 29).
People are no longer expecting a significant change in price.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still be able to create unrestricted cash reserves in an arbitrary manner over a period of one week to three months.
The people are already aware today that this measure will be extended by a few more months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will substantially modify its programme".
"Otherwise, they would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, a co-founder of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," expects Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt bei Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, the ECB "should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that revive the sluggish market", adds Norbert Brams.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area’s sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must step into the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the precipitous enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest countries," a senior bondholder said.
Because if the interest rates were set at the top, the states would be prevented even more from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi’s government is in Italy
After a disturbing start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a bit yesterday with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had described the situation as "uncountable" and had expected him to have an "unpredictable" weekend, which the concerned immediately denied.
At least on Tuesday, the sherry with German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy would have risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "severely concerned" by the "market turmoil" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, a folklore professor at the Hudson Institute.
In plain text, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated sluggish tax revenues that put the state in danger of being no longer able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the Senate budget for review is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the government forecast of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Therefore, also the riot about a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays at a sum of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, new austerity measures need to be taken,” says auditor Olli Rehn.
For the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy to the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), requires lower stabilization progress than other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief of the OECwiks.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of distrust from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the proposed elections could be held as early as the end of March.
Thus, there is a less favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I believe that it has been proven even on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, are ready and committed to defending their currency and their territory".
Although quite relative - yesterday's deduction at the foot of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, from the start of normalization there can be no discussion.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s had announced that it could lower Portugal’s debt record, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
“Like in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly burdensome on the banking systems,” says the opinion of the people of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political period passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it presents, are intensifying discussions on strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in a more general sense, their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
And this is also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan sets out the fate of unconventional measures to strengthen the backbone of the eurozone countries at the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its CEO Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Fernost about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first editions of promotional paper by the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the IMF’s additional, direct commitment to the fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are in the process of adopting structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that will add to the austerity measures, but are expected to have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are on a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
It is at all costs to avoid having to ask for international assistance before setting up their own budget corrections and deciding on unavoidable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of the markets for government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pocket.
Barclays Capital’s national wealth, in terms of the European debt market, as a leading player, judge an extension of around 100 billion euros would suffice, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This fund exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A council that has every opportunity to be examined attentively in the European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are on the rise.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Alarmstufe Orange
The snow episodes still carry traffic difficulties, especially in Brittany’s secondary transport networks, and threaten to impair various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alarm stage due to the imminent risk of snow and glaciers.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in alarm level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow lovers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow blankets are expected from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic jams and impair certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the traffic axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who refrained from using their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses was cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardie, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requests motorists to exercise utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
On Thursday, the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
The Gatwick airports in southern London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it is raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris will be remembered.
To start the construction of the SGP, the state has called for a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend a part of the financial sum to its double in the markets.
Today, it has finally come to the first highs.
The Supplementary Budget of 2010, revised this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this money.
There are two types of measures: the creation of a special development tax and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de-France.
The first, as Article 15 of the draft law states, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the resulting product and to respond to this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that make?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not included in the text.
It is far from the 4 billion.
"It will be implemented that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital donation, which will be raised by the state and will be carried out gradually by the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"From the moment you book revenues (the two taxes, i.e., R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then only make it out of the 4 billion," it explains.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually subtracted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which the promised 4 billion can still be sought for a long time, runs the risk of triggering a rather moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Angry Hackers and Spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in its seeming sanctity that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the regression-dominated future.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every act created by a secret service (an x-believing nation) consists solely of newspaper clippings.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits throw away nothing more than what one read in any x-believing journal over the months anyway (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the horrifyingly cartooned time for their fabricated profile, Scheff Schenkottt’s profile, offered Kaba.
The rule that the secret files should consist only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will find that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism have believed nothing but what they already know and confirm.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
And so is the secret.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a lifting made about the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies – at least since the end of World War II and since then also the heads of government can call each other or have taken a plane to meet up with Spionan at dinner – have lost some of their diplomatic function in recession, and have lost some of their diplomatic function.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it doesn’t happen out of hypocrisy that you do this to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-willing hacker can tap the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the state devastation.
In addition, the scandal brings fewer victims, rather than the "sharp justices" in distress.
But let us dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, you could pool all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct ever since, where you could control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you keep an eye on what’s going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control path stops being unilaterally directed and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's prey - can bring the secrets of the power to life.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Ciliusconis or Merkels is essentially a secret of secrecy, but they were to be kept secret from secrecy, but they were to be kept secret from secrecy.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but against Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this repression that has been inflicted on such a huge power?
It is obvious that states will no longer put any reserved information online in the future – that would be the same as an outline glued to the street corner.
But it’s just as obvious that with the current technologies, it’s in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than figuring out if and when a head of state is moving on a plane and contacting one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds sci-fi and novel, but I see myself compelled to imagine the government agents moving in a secret way on uncontrollable routes, their messages have little in common, they have little in common, they have little information in common, they have little in common, they have little in common memory.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate’s spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is advancing today like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to purchase a film tape for tape by being able to spool from the back to the front and unravel all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs these days allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter.
With the high-speed trains you will travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane including the changeover.
Therefore, it is not unusual for politics and communication technology to come back on car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks out on its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the quickly resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) implemented by the developing countries.
And the coarse French beauty salons have already been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years, while France has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start funding: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and is appreciated for its real value: developing countries and civil society are happy to see it when all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it on the right track to meet its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort has been made, without being made to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the target value they consider best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for 2009: international funding will be retained, and 150 million will be added to the "Fast-Start" funding over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or terms at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France felt that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words: there are no benchmarks for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Concretely speaking, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or also decline) - France is proposing to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about it yet, and everyone chooses their own calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 borrowed as equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 donated.
Obviously, this is only difficult to represent: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission mitigation, which are based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, which is taken as the equivalent of a donated euro. In addition, this should be taken as the equivalent of a donated euro.
But France has nothing else in the sense of the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% of them) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) meet their commitments 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to meet their commitments, France is just giving 10 cents, including a comparable commitment.
Nice hockey poke!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double trick: on the one hand with a further development of the action over time, and on the other hand with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million “new and additional” million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once in the EU (why do the other Member States continue with the donation, if it is not enough to lend...) and then completely change into the negotiations, since the Lwiq is entwined.
The chapter of early funding is only a small question for a relatively short period of time compared to the whole of climate discussion.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
Either way, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring to the fore the discussion on the subject of long-term financing (another crucial topic that is currently being debated): the question of "transferability" or the type of borrowing of its loans is not avoided.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive on the issues of dispute as it is on other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France's fast-start and its vision of "deliverability" and the use of loans would naturally lift the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals over the course of the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "represent no statistically significant value given the small number of samples analyzed, but represent an illustrative character of the problem dealt with", had the usually within four, from a roughly ten-year-old child to the meals consumed in Parisian food plus superfoods.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water per day – were investigated as well as laboratory nurseries looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The platelet balance is daunting: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruption factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the Center for International Cancer.
"Even if, in the approximate totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this study shows very well that the reality in which the consumer may become carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruption is exacerbated."
Already at breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide that is strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spiked.
In the case of tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the most "rich", and even the plastic counter used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unburdened.
The final risk of this “pollutant cocktail” to consumers “will likely be underestimated,” the study said.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilisation diseases" in view of the urgency of the situation.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 residues of different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
