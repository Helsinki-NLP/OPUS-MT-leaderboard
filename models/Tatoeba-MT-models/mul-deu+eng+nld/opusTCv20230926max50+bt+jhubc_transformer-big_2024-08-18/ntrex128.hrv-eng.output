Welsh parliamentarians are worried that they will “look like Muppets”
Some Members of the Assembly (AM) have passed a proposal to be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House of Representatives from all political spectrums are concerned that they might become the object of the message.
A member of the Labour Party’s House of Representatives said his group was concerned that the term “wasting away with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp means bullshit.
A member of the House of Representatives of the Party of Wales (Velch. Plaid Cymru) stated that the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to change the name, but that the MWP in the speech could quickly be converted into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce a name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on how the Assembly members will be entitled will be on their own."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that found broad support for changing the name of the council in the Welsh Parliament.
When it came to the name of the MEPs in the Assembly, the Committee was inclined to be called "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support during the public consultation.
MEPs are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could bring headaches to House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly functions, including rules on the disqualification of the members of the parliament and the establishment of the committee system.
During the debate on the law, the legislature will have a decisive voice regarding the question of how they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents the possession of Greek territory and repeatedly opposed the initiation of the process of its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite's name change, said he would not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silenced as churches in Harlem struggle to survive.
“The older people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one else today.”
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People are getting along in a different way today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly live.”
But when it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think, and "sooner or later it will be back at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people will live who will not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “therefore you will sooner be the day when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the inhabitants who move into those apartments will become members of those churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation emigrated in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation that held worship in the vicinity took over ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by His Excellency John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of His Excellency Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor people.”
An expert who played carillon in July used a different name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing the larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about the architects and builders, some of whom were brought by the Laity leaders of the church, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the parish's governing body composed of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the involvement of architects and contractors of construction works.
Some locals complained about the lack of transparency on the dietician's side.
Sea Dog Hurts 13-Year-Old While Scuba Diving in California
According to an official statement, a sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving behind a lobster in California on the day of the start of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help and then drove the group to the scene of the attack to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was about the excitement of a shark caught, but then he realized he was yelling, “Breaking me!
Bite me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone had been torn apart.
“I told everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a sea dog in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is not known.
The captain of the rescue team, Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a sea dog was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of sea dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas in 48 hours to conduct an investigation and the safety of the bathers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sea dogs in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing luxury-style cosmetic countertops and engaging specialized retailers.
As part of the UK's massive <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market entry, which continues to grow compared to the decline in the clothing and home appliances market, larger cosmetic countertops will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expand to additional retail outlets.
Investing in cosmetics is one of the ways in which supermarkets try to take advantage of the shelves space that was once provided for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the range of cosmetics to 3,000 products, including first-time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores such as Boots.
At the same time, the supermarket is relaunching its range of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and that's what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try to use concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and returning to daily shopping for small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said that outlets will increasingly look like department stores as that chain of supermarkets strives to resist favourable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced outlet Argos into hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, because it bought both chains two years ago, claiming to have boosted the sale of groceries and made these acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to refresh their departments of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's entered a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the distribution of income from pharmacies in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed Sainsbury’s three years ago selling its pharmaceutical business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m in 281 stores in Celesia, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skincare products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our departments with cosmetics to provide our users with a more comfortable environment.
We have also invested in a special training of a colleague who will be at the hands of the customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetics, which will lead to a change in old buying habits."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby resigns from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragon’s Den’s star Peter Jones left to “cook out of anger” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with his trademark to focus on her new contracts with the retail chain Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
Their trademark is compared to the trademark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host This Morning (37) announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the show’s Dragon’s Den Peter Jones to cook out of anger that she has at the last minute withdrawn from a profitable joint venture to focus on her own new great deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when a golden TV girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts were worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million and meant that Trudy's don't have enough time to dedicate himself to their cooking.
This work was compared to the trademark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: “Truely was one of Holly’s top priorities.
This was to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire has overwhelmed everyone involved in this business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to the start of the entire line.
At Marlow's headquarters, the warehouse has a lot of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the host of the show This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain to invest in, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large amounts of funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes.
And that could also mean the end of a long-term relationship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as chairman of the board in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as head of ITV’s I’m a celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the newspapers over comments that some might consider “indecent presidents” and because he has such a positive attitude towards North Korea’s leaders.
“Why did President Trump give so many concessions?”
Trump said, imitating the head of the news.
“I didn’t give any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations about denuclearization have been stalled.
More than three months after a June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North had not noticed the "adequate response" of the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the United States has still not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
In his speech at the summit, Trump took a much more optimistic stance.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results — a halt to test launches of missiles, aid in the release of hostages, and the return of the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena at the entrance, we’d have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of him.
Earthquakes and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not seeking international help, so it’s all a bit problematic,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palo, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Office, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in relief efforts.
Considering the constant shaking of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared for wearing with the anger of nature.
Although shelters in the case of a tsunami were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And in the best time to travel between the many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make it even more difficult for the economy.
A hospital ship that was stranded in Lombok to take care of the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's collapsed structure was at the heart of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Jokoo is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and next year new elections are held.
Joko is also facing the pressure of remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge hits equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in a Premier League match against Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 result for Chelsea.
He shifted the ball to his left leg before shoving it toward the opposite stand.
The ball flew high above the goal to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepa Arrizabalagaj who jumped towards her and entered the net.
“It was challenging to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in the halftime 1-0 after beating Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blues handed the ball back to Mate Kovacic during the match before turning somewhere in the half of the field and competing in Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> performed a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he sent a beautiful passing ball which Hazarda led to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball in the net with his left foot on the opposite stand next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are playing a club competition match against Naples in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will host Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has increased to 832.
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the state's disaster department said Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference that a large number of people were reportedly trapped in the ruins of the building after a 7.5 magnitude quake that was felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is full of ruins.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was fatally beaten.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews in John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people from the area to call if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still in its infancy, but I would like to hear from everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon on the scene came friends who think they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police said that the process of informing the victim's closest relatives is underway.
A taxi driver living on Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours before they can return to their homes.
A police officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He kept saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in the fenced area, and another one was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and oversaw the residential block.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, citing record 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue in Parliament is the latest monument to have fallen amid a debate on the "transition of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupid" and "an attempt to overturn history".
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate currently underway regarding the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been a victim of the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th-century way of thinking and part of the historiography of a person whom many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament from external pressure.
Whether this is a totally credible opinion is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure that represents one side of this division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector continue to be valuable tributes of honor and commemoration."
Chinese farmer's pig killed by killer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead in his artery cut and covered with blood near a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to a South China Morning Journal on Sunday.
The pig breeder was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighbouring pig was opened.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a 250-pound pig bit the breeder to death.
Guiyang's evening news reports say that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and swollen."
A security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuana did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else while the police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, swine attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig dragged a Welsh farmer with a tractor while his wife threw the animal away.
After the pigs were eaten by a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as an “oxidant.”
“They’re just playing.
They're tickling, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But over the next few days, Rosa will bring flooding rains to the area of northern Mexico and southwestern the United States.
At 5:00 a.m. eastern time, Rosa blew at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area above the Pacific is being created and moving towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm-shaped peninsula of Baja California on Monday, a deep layer of tropical moisture will begin to push north-southwestward toward the US.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low-pressure area will cause strong rainfall in much of the southwest.
In local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous thunderstorms, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfall of about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, particularly parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain as much as 25 to 100 mm in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
In any case, it is not advisable to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rainforests.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into quaint rivers, and shrubbed mudslides will bring local stormy winds and dust bolts.
Approaching a low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains on parts of the southern California coast.
It is possible to bends in an amount greater than 12 mm, which can cause less muddy bumps and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
The scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late in the evening and on Monday early in the morning before they cover the wider area at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread on Tuesday to areas that touch the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the retarded summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
In most of the central and eastern U.S., the beginning of October is expected to be warm from 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks tense testimony of Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political accountability continued, and reporters interrupted the regular program to notify the coup at the last minute of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had stabbed her in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a fiery testimony that he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, according to a report by Nielsen.
The company numbered the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
In order to make it better for you, it's an audience that's similar in number to one that's watching American football play or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose guests in the studio strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was a lot of interest even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters yelling at him while trying to go to the Justice Committee hearing by elevator.
For a few minutes, he stood in front of the cameras of CNN, while the protesters watched him face-to-face.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to this country?”
They said to him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement even before the elevator door was closed that he would say more at the hearing of the committee.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were watching live when the Justice Committee was to vote on sending Kavanaugh's nomination to vote in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate charges against the candidates over the next week, which were demanded by minority democracies.
Flake was partially convinced of talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the UK's future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on September 29, 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, went on to criticise her so-called Chequers Brexit plan in a second interview with her in the same headline, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should "pay customs fees to each other".
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in custody on charges of homicide, the Baton Rouge Police Department said in a statement.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to shooting at Waydea and killing him.
A bail of $350,000 has been requested.
The East Baton Rouge mortuary office on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The Department of Police thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the federal state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for enforcing the law on "persistent and truth-seeking."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 183 cm tall wingman grew up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what we always worry about,” Wade said.
Volcano releases ash in Mexico City
The ash that ejects the Popocatapetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash for 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple gripping and subverting.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windscreens in Mexico City's neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Conflict between the Catalan police and the Catalan separatists brings together the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters defending independence clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined anti-demonstrations to mark a Catalan polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists, who were confronted by the intervention police, began beating policemen with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
Fighting broke out later in the day when police used sticks to calm the fighting.
Within hours, the independence groups chanted “No Forgets, No Forgiveness” and the Unionists chanted “Long Lived Spain”.
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital due to minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local media reported.
Tensions in the region seeking independence did not deteriorate a year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid declared illegal, and which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence even though the exit was small because those who opposed the split mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce clashes last year after police tried to stop holding polls at polling stations across the region.
Groups that advocate independence spent Friday night on the streets to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's independence.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
“I watched my parents cry out for the joy they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a crucial, albeit close, victory in last December's regional elections, the Catalan independence parties are hardly able to hold on to the momentum this year because their best-known leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detainees who have not been held accountable for their involvement in the trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is all tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, announced at an investigative prison since the end of last year that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidating for the European elections is the best way we can proclaim the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after killing car in house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they killed themselves several times in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday around 19:30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the patio door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point an arrow was fired from the car.
The Big Bang gave Livingston a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston was a win.
The new Scottish Premiership club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his second defeat of eighteen games led by the club at Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's prediction proved decisive as the team of Gary Holt settled with Iberia in a second.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league with eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not experienced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against dead guests
Holt's team had to lead even before they reached that goal, given that their straightness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke down, but there was a delay on the way to the goal, after which Alan Lithgow could only broadly point the ball after he tilted to intersect Craig Halkett's head to the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties to the guests
And that's how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers missed to stop the free kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Meng who hit the middle of the goal.
Until then, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly had no business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the strike.
Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs were squeezed by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow made a wide hit from another organized attack on Livingstone.
Long-time additions failed to cross Livingstone's goal line, and two eleven were not awarded - after Halket's clashes with substitute Glen Middleton and one to play by hand.
“Great” by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the BBC at Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone up to one was excellent, so they continued to exceed expectations on that entrance path.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return to the big clubs, but the big credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at leading the well-organized defense, and Menga throughout the game did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to have a respite.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set for a good game under Gerrard.
They couldn't get the ball to the finish line. They only opened a hole in the home team once, and that's a kind of call to trade for the Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) there was a lot of smiles under the skies when the leader of Tursa and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – whose goal is to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed the views on issues that include human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters of the president came to see it.
And hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan – including a large number of Kurds – have raised their voices by condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the divisiveness provoked by a visitor who some German Turks celebrate as a hero, and others attack as an autocrat.
Deptford Road Crash: Bicyclist Killed in Car Crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of town around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist was fatally injured after a collision and a driver fled from the scene of the accident on Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
The city police said police officers were attempting to identify the man and inform his closest relative.
Due to the accident, roads have been closed and bus traffic has been redirected, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Disturbances
The prison administration said six police officers had been injured in riots in a male prison of the inmate's type.
The riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special "Tornado" troops have been brought in to suppress the riots involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the spot have been provided with assistance due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been hired to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were assisted because of the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they can spend longer time behind bars."
The Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, intervention police were called to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with hectic flooding (possible benefit for dry areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa with the remaining force crosses the Desert Southwest and poses a threat of buoyant flooding.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt City.
Rosa is expected to approach Phoenix late on Monday with rain and cross straight over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or depressions within 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Rock and the Great Pool, there is a probability of a range of 25 to 50 mm, with a possible insulated total amount of up to 100 mm.
For those out of danger from the turbulent floods, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these areas could be useful because drought is currently raging in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. drought map, just over 40 percent of Arizona was hit by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” weather.com reported.
Hurricane trails first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was located 620 km south of the town of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and was moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The flooding hit the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that on Monday afternoon or evening, the coast of Mexico will approach the force of a tropical storm.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the peninsula of Baja California to northwestern Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, a possible maximum of 250 mm,” weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rains on the Baja California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening thunderstorms and mudslides in the deserts and glaciers in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four People Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempting murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
At around 4 a.m. BST on Saturday, an injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He's taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset Police Department said a 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called on anyone who has a record of the incident.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Suffered the Anger and Anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for rejecting the Democratic Party’s cruel and shameful tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered anger and anger” from the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing about the indictment she made.
The president said on Saturday that on that day "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service,” he said.
The president touched upon Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republicans leaving the mid-term election.
“Five weeks have given us one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
An assistant to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami continue to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, a large number of which were deflected by huge waves hitting the coast when a major quake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when twilight waves up to six meters high hit the coast, dragging many of them to death and destroying everything on their way.
The quake was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee and were killed,” Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trucks, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived,” he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two-fold strength of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"Communications have been completely interrupted and we have no information from Donggal."
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were deployed to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for failing to provide information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of the building panicked to warn people down the street of an impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall collided on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a power outage that caused communication disruptions around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuators still needed food and other necessary supplies.
The city's airport is reopened for humanitarian activities only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
Cunami in Indonesia has killed more than 800 people.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Donggale successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where employees were sheltered in tarpaulin tents placed in the yard of their office, they passed the scenes of destruction along the way,” Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched aid wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been barred from entering Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and engagement of personnel from other countries can only be started if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘Okay, it’s a national disaster’ we can receive international aid, but such a state has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Palo on Friday, friends and families of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that alleviate black natural disaster scenarios.
The boy was rescued from the sewer on Saturday.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who was trapped under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia's state paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
“Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel that expanded the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu who had participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray hammer, instead of two blue hammers.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while charging ATMs in downtown Newport on the Levee
The burglars stole $26,750 from Brink's staff at the Newport on the Levee ATM on Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Administration.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, the other man "came to Brink's employee in the race behind his back" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a Twitter post on Saturday announcing the change, he said: "Live will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes on the eve of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said it replaced singer Arian Grande in the show, who canceled it for "emotional reasons."
In addition to the abbreviation of his current artistic name, West previously stated that the word had religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year in an interview with radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
“I am you, I am us, it is us.
It started from Kanye, which means “the only one,” into just Ye – it’s a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former co-worker, Jay-Z, was playing with versions of his name without a drawing and with a drawing and written in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use its military against civilians
Mexican Presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge on students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised in the square of Tlatelolco that he would "never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and by opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount invested in research in the field,” said Kai Fu Leeu, an artificial intelligence investor and an expert in the field who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence in principle.
In the meantime, last year, China presented its plan: it aims to become the first country in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
“Doubling the investment could double the chances of the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence coming to the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, “AI Grand Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the best American gamer Othello, and later served as director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would take place next to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that leads academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research over the past few years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
The Chinese State Council announced a plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Foundation for Science and other state organizations providing funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve business and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of US$2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and that is why Greece has blocked the opening of negotiations for a European agreement to NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the possession of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments in June agreed on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the exit would meet the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price that is worth paying to make Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, accessible to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary election, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko, reached a referendum in Strumica on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and welcomed the chairs in front of the tents set by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not as servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to welcome us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Zaev said NATO membership would bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “positive” result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the required response.
The second poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the exit rate must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through the entire defense of Brighton to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England broke Brighton's defense and won for Manchester City with a score of 2-0.
Aguero made the win insanely simple, scoring a hit in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through three players of Brighton's defense and then reached the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opponents in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender, and then crossed them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguera, who kicked the right-handed ball into the right-hand side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulty with his foot," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy to have reached the finish line at the time."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues the first lead in the Premier League.
That shot was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's field during this game.
Beautifully, he added the ball to Leroy Sane along his left side.
Sane smashed the ball several times before leading Sterling to the stand.
The Sky Blues attacker threw the ball into the net just before sliding into the car.
Manchester City are playing against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to impede the advancement of Rockies
Since Nationals players were eliminated from play, there wasn't too much reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitive-minded Scherzers are hoping for Sunday's win against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the lead from one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, come into play.
The Rockies on Friday night, with a 5:2 win over the Nationals at least secured a spot in the wild-card playoffs, but still hope to win their first title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, we can at least throw away knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I’d witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a Sunday starter, but are reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher room on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
Washington's right-hander this season scored 18: 7, an average of 2.53 wins (ERA) and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
During a speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the general election, the president vehemently commented on his election of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
“Everything we’ve done will be tested in November.
It's five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
“These are one of the big, big ones – I didn’t run, but I’m actually in the race and that’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that’s happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to overcome to take power and control; that's why they want power and control. We won't give them."
The Democrats, he says, have a mission “to resist and interfere.”
“You’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angers, evils, corrupts and liars.”
He killed Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee on behalf of the Senate, which caused a loud disapproval of the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer respects different opinions.
Does not tolerate the expression of personal attitudes
I wasn't surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of Labour Party representatives who have been told that they are not welcome – and all because we have said what we have in mind.
In my opinion, MP Joan Ryan behaved similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the proposal for censorship for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
A note on the Nottingham East Labour Party branch meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the eight years I've been working as a local Labour Party representative, the main council meetings on Friday night were just that.
Unfortunately, in today’s times, many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a “lover, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as the collaborators I thought we shared similar political views began to demand a drastic change of opinion from me and a position I would never agree with the EU – whether it was national security or national security.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a whirlwind of insulting words on social media calling for my revocation, rejecting the centre’s policies and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that have been addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a swarm of sexist or racist comments on a daily basis, but never stop.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me the most is the tolerance of insulting speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal of distrust or change of electoral rules we become an increasingly narrow party.
"Many times in the last two years they have advised me to shake my head, not to be so loud, and told me that then everything will be fine."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the government’s neglect of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school’s multi-purpose classroom to collapse, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or a minister in a cabinet.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East Branch could have been misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will negatively affect households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of revocation or political benefit will distract me from your best interest in acting as it does.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat influenced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership league.
Now they have reached the top of the ladder and are the only one of ten teams to be undefeated.
Ultimately, top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
“They’ve tried us in every game so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazier Climo brought Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to raise the scores, and Jason Baggot did not take advantage of it.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by eleven before, at the same half-time, he scored and carried out an independent attempt to change the score for Ayr to 17:5 on the eve of the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to score Baggot reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long pause due to Ruarid Knott's serious injury to the carriers, and as the game continued, Ayr continued the good game with Stafford McDowall's attempt at Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again forced an additional player to pay, with unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for breaking the Clima that didn't have the ball; from the penalty line, MacPherson made a deposit behind Ayr in the full swing of the breakthrough.
Climo realised, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the home team.
Star of the series Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, appears ready to continue working in service activities after it is discovered that he is appointed director of the company's licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite series, which is a screenwriter and one of the stars, along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to appear, and Kiernan appears to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will assign it an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling a naval center full of elevators in La Paz.
A flag of the color of the ocean has been reported on public buildings.
From the sea bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, there is a wing: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of the lost coastline in favor of Chile during the conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive – just as the desire for renaissance in the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's verdict, which is expected on October 1, after a five-year trial, and hopes are perhaps at the highest level in the last few decades.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A crowd of Bolivians across the country will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's view that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate a resignation of the sovereign.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's ruling.
“We are hopeful for the return of the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling comes just six months after the final hearings means that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting the interests of Bolivia, the last four years may have been lagging behind them.
“The question of access to the sea has been adopted by the current Bolivian leadership,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's war rhetoric has buried every goodwill of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “an unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “stop 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – had used the maritime issue as a political stick.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The opportunity is an opportunity to see that we need to cross the past.”
North Korea says it will not have nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclear-disarmed if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during the meeting of the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems likely to soon resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues, which comes more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "empty fantasies" and that the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will not throw the North on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up the arsenals that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Magazines Reveals That The Last Line Of Big Headwear Is On The Road To A Luxury Shop In Your Neighborhood
Whether you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely cover the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a line of discarded giant head covers on the fashion lane for their spring and summer 2019 collection and fascinated style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have inspired Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that draw attention to the track.
The example that stood out was Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide, feather-like outline that completely "takes over" the head of the model.
Other ragged accessories included jewellery-decorated shells, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories aren't designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had stitched lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high-fashioned pieces.
One creation resembled a dive suit with a disalice and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion statement – luck is on your side.
The stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with the soles of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference of about 60 cm that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that stands behind an extremely impractical hat that subdued social networks on the fashionable runway sent another big creation – a straw bag for the beach almost as big as a model in the swimsuit that wore it.
A burnt orange raffle bag, decorated with raffle cuts and a white leather handle, was an exhibition copy in Jacquemus’ La Riviera’s summer collection for 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous and famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories.”
John Edward: The Language Skills That the World's Citizens Need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, and the added weight to this is given by individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the aforementioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his mother tongue, it goes to his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot only use the English language if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest scores in languages have been achieved by students of independent schools.
A total of 68% of pupils who learned foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils received an excellent score for the Mandarin language, while 72% of pupils who learn German, 69% of pupils who learn French and 63% of pupils who learn Spanish were also the most likely.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 % of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of language skills workforce.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs demand language skills, these skills are key in a globalised world.
Regardless of your career choice, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives him an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov, which involved more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75% of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing economies, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will opt for languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, in independent schools there will always be a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools provide children with an environment in which they will learn to prepare and equip themselves with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for us.
One cannot ignore the fact that in today's global business age, language skills are very important for the future of each country, so that must also be reflected in education.
Thus, the knowledge of modern languages should indeed be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer a choice of languages, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools.
LeBron will play in the Lakers shirt for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans will soon see LeBron James' first performance for the Lakers in Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in his first pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
I don't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
“More than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans for the Lakers, which consisted of six games.
“At this stage of my career, I really don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign at numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned meetings Trump will hold next week, including brief visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming election as there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia starting tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s collection in West Virginia online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s candidate who has sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate’s confirmed decision is pending for a week before the FBI’s investigation ends.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans achieve an advantage in the November elections.
Trump’s presidential campaign headquarters said the five meetings planned for next week were aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“The majority in Congress is so important to the president’s plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a turbulent campaign,” an anonymous Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month on Saturday. In that country, he won 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve the rankings in the polls,” political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team left their hearts on the field ahead of individual rounds on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the pair's circuit on Sunday afternoon might be exactly what was supposed to reverse the Ryder Cup.
"The wheel of happiness turns" is a phrase that is especially true in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions like this.
To whom is the wheel of happiness now preferred?
"They had six points in the lead, and now they have four, so I think luck is on our side right now," Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead with four points, while there are still 12 points left until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouraged him by playing in pairs with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after a full-day game.
Spieth played murderously from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheering celebratory outcry became louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, and all culminated in the key path by which Spieth came to an unresolved result.
After a 15-hole game, a similar cheerleading url followed, in which one can recognize the hope and belief that Americans can turn everything around.
“You just have to focus and think about your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for the players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
The European odd but irresistible pair has a maximum number of points and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only pair not to lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
This winning array, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’ Le Golf National.
Maybe they'll both win at the same time on different holes.
It’s too early to talk about the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly cut off Alex Noren and Sergey Garcia, who had a great performance in the couple's morning game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the playground buried the Spaniards and Swedes in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, on Sunday, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their holes.
It is fascinating to watch the game pairs closely because you can see the interactions of the players in the pair, hear the tips they give and the ones they don’t, as well as study the strategy that can be changed in the moment.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they come in with a significant lead, but this game in pairs has also shown that the U.S. team has the necessary fighting skills, in which some, especially the States, have suspected.
Europeans enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's pairs game on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant lead over the United States from 10:6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points difference at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team in an attempt to win the trophy that he missed at Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in pairs, achieving a score of 3:1.
The U.S. team showed greater wrestling in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the trophies, teams of Jim Furyk must collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debutant to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinari, known as "Molliwood", are the second pair to win four points in pairs in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they proved to be superior in the game against Woods and U.S. debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5–4 win.
Woods, who did not show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats from 29 games in fourball and pairs and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to play with partner Henrik Stenson and experience a 2&1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third-best player.
But the Europeans didn’t quite go as lubricated during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and so set the ladder high for their American team.
They first defeated the Spaniards Jonah Rahm and Ian Poulter with a 2&1 fourball result, then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was behind four points managed to return in individual games, although Furyk's team only needed an unsolved result to retain the trophy.
After two days behind, it seems that their Sunday counterattack will be hard to fall.
North Korea says it has “no chance” of unilateral disarmament without confidence.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's foreign minister told the U.N. on Saturday that further sanctions are increasing confidence in the United States and there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill,” such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test station, and making a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology.
“However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States of America,” he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have faith in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will disarm first unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's "stage" denuclearization approach under which North Korea would gradually lift sanctions, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea wants to formally end the Korean War that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction in stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization be carried out first and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to forcibly achieve its goal, and even opposes the 'end of war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting of Kim and Trump that the US president had talked about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister stressed that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in have held as many as three meetings in the last five months, adding: "If South Korea had requested denuclearization, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have happened."
Despite everything, the tone of Riyadh's speech differed greatly from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and stated that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim "a man-in-the-middle man" a "missile man."
Trump, who threatened "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to disarm, but added that there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea executes.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearization, adding: "It doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue rigorously until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization occurs."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of “gangster demands.”
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and the nuclear complex that will take place if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these "appropriate measures" refer to the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course where they learn how to get a good rest
The new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of the course after giving a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I find out this only now, in my last year of college?”
"She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits help in academic and sporting success and generally improve health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health care, said the university had decided to introduce the course after students had a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how sleep deprivation affects success, and how important a sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is shown that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in full-time learning before the exam continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Chaisler devise the course after attending his lectures in his first year at Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As the next step, it plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar course of study before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0 : Mengin goal defeat Gerrard Boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's hit over Steven Gerrard's missing defense and finished the game with Livingstone's 1-0 win.
The boys from Ibrox wanted to achieve their first guest win after a 4:1 victory in February in St. Johnston, but team Gary Holt caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team now lags behind eight points in the Ladpude Premier League.
Menga reached the event seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to be left without inspiration and did not seem to match the result.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one event of difference behind the Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence suffered a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the sides and so clashed alongside Ayr until the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingstone regiment that Hearts had taken last week and would be delighted that his well-designed regiment had suffocated every attempt by his opponent.
The Rangers may have had more ball in their possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They had a chance to happen just two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game, opening space for Scott Pittman to move towards Allan McGregor's goal, however, the tiebreaker missed that opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's deep free kick was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an inaccurate blow to the rear rows.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of with conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought the referee should have scored an eleven-year-old in the 15th minute after his clash with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not comply with the Colombian request.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had a single blow to Lassana Coulibaly's head and a stupid blow to Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstone's 34-minute play slowed down the game, no one can deny their effort.
The Rangers again failed to take advantage of Jacobs's return ball.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who retained his integrity and chose Meng as an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement was almost instantaneous because the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long shot after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide incursion from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an eleven-year-old because he had teamed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his gaze this time too.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now follows the page from our Almanach in the show "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and a few days ago... the birthday of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has become the main foundation of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Colorado" in which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the main roles:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “You see it, you can hear it!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” Bad Cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
The cells are treated to "recognize" the protein that is common to many cancers and then injected back into the patient.
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer withdrew for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting the cells of the immune system from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to be able to "recognize" a protein called HER2, which is common to many types of cancer, and re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and their "learning" to identify cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
After a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, Kanye West became involved in discussions about Trump and supported him, wearing a cap that read “Let’s make America great again.”
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live following a show with interruptions in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of an evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the cap “Let’s make America great again,” he continued to speak out against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often and they say to me, ‘As you might like Trump, he’s a racist.’”
"Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's speech on social media was broadcast by comedian Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock was trying to smash West.
West also complained to the public that he was being pushed behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
“I was chased behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hood."
They molested me!
"They said I was drowning," the Washington Examiner said.
West went on, "You want to see the bottom?" and said he was going to put on his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try it out with love.”
Variety magazine reported that his comments had been at least twice annoying to the audience, and members of Saturday Night Live were embarrassed, while one person for the magazine said: "The whole studio has been silenced."
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West's performance of the song "I love it", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, surprised many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "One of the people with the bravest spirit: Thank you for what you represent the mafia."
But the show's host, Karen Hunter, said on Twitter that West was "just his own and that it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing, or supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
"We are too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he would now "officially be known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Court of Appeals on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington has turned to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor turned to the stereotype of a hero's cat, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel they need to be strong in order to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie from the Game of Thrones series, has admitted that he wants to "resolutely" face this problem.
“I personally feel very determined at this moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did men learn when they grew up about the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on screens, could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued, “What is born and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets, and why do boys feel that they have to have these particular drawings of men?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming the sequel to the Game of Thrones series after its end next summer and said he was “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will play in the new play True West by author Sam Shepard, a story about a film producer and his brother a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
“I met my husband while filming this series, which gave me a family and a future life,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases
China said the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases of infection are transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said there were almost no people infected with HIV in this way.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
Transmission of the HIV virus by sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is big.
Research estimates that because of conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public's staff has leaked data on GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Rep. Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal data of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic Representative believes that these claims spread to "ultra-right wing" individuals, as well as websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The data reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday and was published by an unidentified person with Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the disclosure belongs to Rep. Waters' office, as well as information about the rep. member of staff, The Hill newspaper reported.
“These unfounded statements are completely false and absolutely false,” Waters said in a statement.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false allegations – is in no way responsible for leaking that data.
"These unfounded statements are completely false and absolutely false. "
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the Internet, including former White House spokesman Ariel Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He mustn't be rude.
He must not reconsider the motives of the accused.
It has to be calm and steady."
Fleischer seemed to compare Barbare Walters' reaction with critics of Democrats referring to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who contests Watersova in the general election, also tweeted.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had notified "measuring bodies and law enforcement agencies" of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she said.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Again on a Mission" – not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson fights the spy
Now it is already common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and so it seems in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel titled "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003.
Will the enthralled satire about how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
Johnny English's incompetent eye-witness and gum-face has once again been allowed to complicate situations, while his name more than anything tells him it's a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is of course a disconnected secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of "diluted" glamor, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a hint of Mr Bean's character and somewhat resembles that guy who sang a 2012 Olimpian melody and released a note of the introductory song "Chariots of Fir."
His character is also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man whom Atkinson once played in now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and which is the epitome of chaos.
There are one or two great moments in this new movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie titles such as "007" and "Impossible Missions" offer the elements of the comedy itself.
Humor sounds like it's meant for children, not adults. In my opinion, Johnny English's ripped-off stories aren't as innovative and focused as the Atkinson's non-geeks embodied in the character of Mr Bean.
The presumption that the UK is in serious trouble now is already a widely accepted fact.
Hacker has entered Britain's most secretive web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, who is unfortunately portrayed by Kevin Eldon.
It spilled the glass of Prime Minister's patience, a superstitious and warlike figure who is experiencing the complete breakdown of the system because he is politically disgusted: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully portray the character she should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get the material to do something with.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And this person will be Johnny English's head and beard, who is currently employed as the headmaster of a kidnapping school, but he's learning how to become a secret agent: there's a few pretty geysers here because English teaches rock-style espionage.
Englisha is quickly brought to government rooms for an urgent meeting, where she reunites with Bough, a former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely depleted.
And so, the two members of Her Majesty’s Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong get back into action and meet a beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bullet, who was played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the villainous Jason Volt played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their exciting journey with absurd and funny events: a French restaurant smuggled into a bar, smuggling into a smuggled-out smuggling on Volt's luxury yacht, and English challenges a virtuoso virtuoso how to use the listeners.
Everything has been done as it should for this final sequel, but no matter how attractive and distracting the film is, it still contains a host of children's elements.
It's a pretty central accomplishment.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I was once again wondering if the British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party denies designing a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week and be paid for five days of work.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to pass on the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution's savings to workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could be "clutched" into a party economic program and plans for the country to favor the interests of workers.
The trade union congress supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be published by the end of the year.
“The four-day working week will not be realized overnight, but it represents a trend that fits into the approach that this party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as into the overall industrial strategy of this party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this trend.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not the policy of the party and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour Party conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take power out of the hands of “different executives” and “profiters” in municipal enterprises.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to repay their overall stake because the Labour government could make “deductions” based on the observed irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in the company's boards of directors and create inclusive equity funds to give 10% of private company capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court in at least a week and questions whether the agency's conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would discover something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said next to the debate, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they gave you instructions, and I asked, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, unwavering, unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be carved in stone.
“I’m determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really should have a strong charge to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett definitely denied everything,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she named were able to confirm her claims.
Thirty-six years have passed since that.
I don’t see anything changed.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive star list and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (unless they were unwilling to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "works" such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, phone calls, or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal.
But how successful is the Global Citizen, given that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – where people feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet, they really change something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters who have sought to achieve a number of different goals.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership of investors and operators in the UK that is committed to “helping children to develop to their fullest potential”, with a promise that, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, the recipient will provide more than 35 million tweets.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and citizens of the world like you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition becomes only a fuss in history,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of the “The Power of Nutrition” Foundation in London, told The Guardian.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the project “The Power of Nutrition” which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on his website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult journey and we will sometimes fail.
But we will succeed, as the great movement for civil rights and against apartheid has succeeded before us, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the performances at this year's New York event that will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports and the Interior Minister
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said on Wednesday, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in Syria is particularly where it acts on the call of a legitimate government as an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in that area as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But, in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure openness of shipping routes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at the event, hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance group, which in the United States presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuel,” he said, and told Russia he was “serving the same trick” in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as the Trump administration’s intention to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In that sense, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "slave" Mozambique.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to clone EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts State Senator
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the mid-term election.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for her own.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means the woman at the head,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren expressed an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying he is “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of the votes for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrat names discussed in connection with the 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD track Palin at Donald Trump summit
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with the incident of domestic violence that took place on Monday evening.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through after his return, is comparable to other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that he was silent about and said for his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots are, and all the other members of the army."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of alcoholic weapons, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla City Police Administration.
18 states and D.C. support the review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and counties submitted a friendly report on Friday in Washington to provide support to an asylum seeker who is contesting the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions, filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come, as countries facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 Immigration Committee's decision to allow undocumented immigrants to run away from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia’s District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved on the basis of the concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court’s friend said in a report.
Lawyers went on to state that a policy that denies entry to immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems—even all the serious problems—that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly difficult.
“The situation is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while reassuring her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency vehicles are bringing in bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, wandering through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were cramped.
Some of the injured, including Two Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, rested in front of Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of a violent quake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
I think I was trapped inside the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Maltreatment’ by ‘Propaganda’
A week after official Chinese newspapers published four pages of a long ad in a U.S. daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press to spread the propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday looked at a paid China Daily supplement in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, which China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described in a statement to Reuters as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowe, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "is now doubling this abuse by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, at the newspaper kiosk in the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China’s disturbing economic path because the media are under firm political pressure.”
He added that "some of the most prominent Chinese newspapers have declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
With Kavanaugh's debacle, Republicans have removed voters before the mid-term election, analysts warn
As many Republicans stand alongside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defend him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn it will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding the event were highly aroused, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to continue to give their voice.
Such things can't come back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell College, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher has expressed doubts that the last insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on conducting an FBI investigation will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday and will not forget it either tomorrow or November,” Karina Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told a Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted: "Come November!", protesting in the Senate hallway as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee were preparing to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reports.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news.
“People say they’re already on a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by Supreme Court justices, analysts have suggested there could be a negative reaction if Republicans continue to confirm it.
“This is a real confusion for the Big Old Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve, but also how the Republicans approached it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will trust after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more prone to it.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitively or likely believe in the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh safe or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for Supreme Court judge showed her her genitals at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the place where their data is stored and the people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, thinking of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solido technology to allow people to create their own "personal network data storage" or POD.
It may include contact lists, lists of responsibilities, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is a decision about who can access which information is completely user-friendly.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data”.
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is that the company provides the resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world have been able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all of their business models would completely turn over overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a press release released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of networking,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the First World War Priest's Honour with the Victoria Cross
Celebrations in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a World War I fighter were performed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918, in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "impossibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's inauguration for which he received the award.
According to a report in the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and the mechanics".
He later slammed into the front lines and, with "incredible courage" he led the troop forward before jumping to the Polish top without anyone's help and smothering three of the military squadron.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never achieve, and that encourages humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated through the support that many people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch the Bellator 206, and instead got Pra<0xC5><0xA1>ki<0xC4><0x87> Peppu
Imagine this and stay awake all night to watch down the Bellator 206 matches so that you will eventually be disabled to track the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were shown live at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, spectators in the UK were shocked when the transmission was interrupted by Peppa's Pra<0xC5><0xA1>tice.
Many were not impressed by the fact that they remained awake until the early hours of the morning just because of the fighting.
One fan of the interruption of the transfer of children's cartoons on Twitter described it as "some kind of sick joke".
“According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Jupi, <0xE2><0x80><0x9B>Peppa<0xE2><0x80><0x9B>"
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about repression, I think we probably can fix something,” Coker said.
“But the transfer is there at six a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until we have a Sunday, when they will already have a Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were a lot of transcripts that weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. The problem is state nature.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which we're doing otherwise. We tried to give more to our fans, but we overdid it.
It's about unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority over others because of his sexuality but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school he was not aware that “they’re not all like me.”
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, which leads Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights in order to give others “hope.”
He also said that his victory at the Olympics has been less important since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a loser on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" in his adulthood because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity compared to others have been real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove he was “someone and something” so that he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double-winner of the bronze Olympic medal has become a prominent person who advocates for LGBT people and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke in public because he believed he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised that he fell in love with a man and American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said his age difference was never a problem.
"When you're so young you go through so much," he recalled his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, and said that it was difficult to find someone the same age and that he had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the whole story would be about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my gold medal at the Olympics.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had purchased tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be here long enough to be in the first order,’” he said.
"I held him in my hand until he exhaled, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that that’s what I’ve been dreaming about all my life and jumping in front of my home audience at the Olympics wasn’t a better feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for the selection of the first song <0xCC><0x88> "The Flow" by singer Heather Small <0xCC><0x88> , which she radiated in it during preparations for the Olympics and which she always resorted to .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to get back in shape to avoid an unpleasant turnaround.
Mickelson, who plays in this two-year competition for the record twelfth time, was sent to the club by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and developing his game at the gym in hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the challenging Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain routinely punishes inaccurate blows.
And if the field itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson is facing precise British Open champion Frances Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has won all four matches this week with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, get a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man and more than that and could not say.
"He fully understood the role he played today, shoved me on my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“There is a lot of self-confidence.”
He's been famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more of them, but that's how it turned out and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record for the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence also brought certain intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for that,” he said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the big advantage in the final day of individual matches of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable race.
Danac made his debut in a match at Valderra in 1997, where the team of captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended with their win with a close difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderra; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderra, where we won, but with a close difference,” Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the team’s Golf match at the top 10 in 2018, which won the top 5 in a row.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will play with full force.
Go out into the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floor's on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
"I'm talking all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who's standing in front of us and the biggest players in the world."
Excited by the performance of his players on the tough golf course, Bjorn added: “In this I would never run in front of the ore.
You'll have to face a different beast tomorrow.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything goes well, but when you’re there as an individual, they’re ultimately testing your golfer skills.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, and she's that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Leave your partner now because he has to do the best he can."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with the players, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those big turnovers last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finishing as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 squad, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When this advantage starts in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
Accordingly, we organized our crew and placed the boys as if, you know, we were going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead a counterattack and confronts Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I have decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship put on hold again
The latest frigate of the German navy was due to be put into service in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be ready at least until next year due to faulty systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as it is known, it will have a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period and it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the home port.
However, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power abroad – will already become obsolete by the time of entry into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate reached all headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship go and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would render the warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would handle crews of about 120 sailors and half less than the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it has been shown that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming especially important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Defense Parliament Committee, acknowledged that the navy was actually "in possession of ships capable of deployment".
The official said the problem increased over time, as the old ships were put out of operation and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the navy.
The National Foundation Listens to the Secret Life of Butterflies
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how butterflies use the landscape in hunting for food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in conducting future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will follow common and wet dwarf bats, as well as brown elongated and river bats in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile screenings using handheld detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of butterfly voting and what kind it does.
Then a residence map and a report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Conservation Adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for butterflies and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of limestone and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Butterfly populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and decorating works that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as mosquitoes and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks on pet cats.
The squirrels aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching mushrooms.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find drums and obstacles in the path of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taking bats very seriously.
There are ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only butterfly reserve in Scotland on the Threa estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of butterflies that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal area for them.
“We have a huge butterfly space here in Thravey,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good living quarters.
However, there's still a lot we don't know about butterflies, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need to make progress."
It underlines the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside the building, since accidental destruction of a bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, potentially destroying the entire local population.
Shishas are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Scottish Butterfly Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply don’t know how their population is progressing.”
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will be prosecuted by the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It was reported that he paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
“They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the business.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called “unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions,” Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violations, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was "a good guy" that "one percent" was disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but that he was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was photographed with injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she now wants to cancel the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he switched to Italian giant Juve as part of a move worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK will "forever be embarrassed" by the loss of automakers
The UK will "forever be disappointed" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, should Britain leave the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston engine, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My position is that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience the stagnation of production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have voiced fears about leaving the EU without a deal due to the possible consequences for the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The carmaker's main concern relates to the risks in the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates according to the “just in time” principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota at its Derbyshire plant would not be able to hold more supplies than needed for a day, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
“We want to reach the best possible agreement, which, as I say, will allow us not only to maintain our current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“Evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers shows that we must absolutely be able to continue this highly successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but they warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouwallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union Unite, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once those jobs are gone, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have come up with a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “suspended for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the election, the relationship between Trump's associates and Russia, and the possible interference of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence, has been sparking tensions in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wiring to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has rejected these statements.
But on Monday, he went to the White House amid announcements that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Fore.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a lot of Senate votes.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not a consequence of repulsiveness to the “theatrical behavior” of television reporters, although she said: “I will not oppose the fact that I am confused.”
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president organizes more meetings to answer questions than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing evidence: “We analyzed the numbers.”
Short talks will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask a question to the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to make it possible, and that’s what you’ve seen in the last few weeks, and it’s that you can talk to the president of the United States that will replace briefings to journalists.”
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performances in front of assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to EU staff at the Scottish NHS to express gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to meet the cost of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations have continued between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the functioning of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Saturday defeat from Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31–27, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He got to the playground line and just crashed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on the carrier and sending it for further searches.
A Tennessee State University representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was "no details about the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with a two-year internship, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five touchdowns before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 touchdowns per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK
According to conservatives’ new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This step will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
An increase in the tax will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
Riznica expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high salaries.
The increase will be levied by individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, and additional money will contribute to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee <0xCC><0x88> that is accrued to the current fee, including an increase that was introduced two years ago on other homes and properties purchased for issuance <0xCC><0x88> can be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to be raised with this move.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built real estate in London is bought by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first real estate to join the society of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy followed just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and called on Ms May to give up quotas on affordable real estate in order to correct "shame over the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposal for a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of zero-induced deportations.
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the renewal of the British dream and that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means repairing our collapsed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it cannot be correct that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes easily as well as valuable British.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer, he moved to the Lights Stadium after being led by St. Mirren again last season at the Scottish Football Championship.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and that always drew me back.
However, this opportunity could only be realized if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland's management include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
The former head of Allo Athletica says he was not afraid because he inherits such well-known names in such a large club, having previously declined calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this moment will be measured by whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
"Because of its structure and content, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross only completes his third year of managerial career, after a period during which he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months of experience as part of Heart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloy recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the champions next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," recalled Alloe's takeover.
“I really believed that managing is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, earning solidly, and enjoying pretty successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for the door is at 17:30 on Saturday, as research shows
The summer heat wave increased revenues for British pubs struggling with finances, but increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw revenue rise by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the Business Consultation of the Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “Continuation of the good times and England’s participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected, if the rest of the time had been longer than expected, it would have meant that July would have been similar to the previous month.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have made much greater profits on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served have also been plagued by heat, though not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed breweries and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the course of the month, and food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM Analyst for Recreation and Hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the foreign market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with difficulties, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-on-year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse time for the managers of the premises where food is served, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the necessary supplies."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, in July stood at 2.7 percent, reflecting a slowdown in the share of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and has established an industrial benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Research reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
The news has heightened the fear of the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts and references to the photo sharing website.
The news heightened the fear of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of pupils said they used a cleaned “main” account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged her with the words “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s fascinating that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of an athlete in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Committee as non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will have great benefits by making her a member of the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice athlete and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-metre race at the 1996 Atlanta Games, out of his total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, after a transient ischemic attack, could no longer walk.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it was only time to show if I was going to recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learning to walk again today for the sake of agility exercise!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
Shared opinions on the internet about advertising for a publisher that compares mothers to cows
A publishing company with its advertising that compares mothers breastfeeding their children to cows that have spurred a man on the internet has shared opinions.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be “the world’s first silent portable publisher,” Elvie’s consumer technology company released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new publisher gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stand filled with hay and cows with music whose lyrics read: "Yes, I muse myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't vime, it's my breasts."
Then there's the chorus: "Pump, pump, feed your baby, pump, pump, muse your lady."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from viewers, and many say it illuminates the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that they steal their babies a few days after birth,” one person wrote.
Elvie's cheater discreetly fits in breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
The other person comments: “Understandably traumatic for the mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added: “Completely free advertising.”
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that her song was “smiling.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The passing of milk made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understand it as it is.
“This is a brilliant product,” she said.
The other person commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who give out milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were all dancing with discrete publishers placed in their chests.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who give milk say they feel like a cow.
Elvie's cheater, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding breast, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even get out during the cheating.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie exhibitor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making the parallel between the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to focus on the betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvis has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to put children under sponsorship.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and feared to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping out and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been recorded in the criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household in the country are illegal, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we are continuing our search for these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
According to the statement of the shelter workers, with the aim of speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the norm.
Many will appear through a videoconferencing call, not in person, to bring their case before the immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for aid will be deported quickly.
According to statements by shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Advocates said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as the Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child is struggling will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent town without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet them with friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the auspices of fighting terrorism, and would “consistently deal with them.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared of terrorist groups and any illegal presence of foreigners.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that prompted refugees not to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on the end of the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with Russia's support on the region of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front linked to Al Qaeda, “who will be eradicated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely hoping, the recall and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
There are currently no signs of spectators being killed.
As of 2014, hit-time views have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on strike, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" outperformed the viewership with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the main TV shows.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s drama Designated Survivor, about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, comedy author and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a lot of fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law stemming from the Roe v. Wade trial, whether immigrant families can also reunite the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you’re going beyond the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used “deep background” sources for his book, “Fear,” about the pawns of Paul Manafort’s “pocket” and the “pockets” of the “pockets of the foot” (previous 15,000).
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
“Part of what he makes you experience it as a reality show is that something feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “Zalagaonica”, about the rotating acting set and the everyday complications of the Trump-Boy show.
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you're gonna be late.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of Kauai Island, it was sunny at a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 degrees Celsius), but he was inside watching MSNBC and simultaneously filming CNN.
He could not separate himself from the television, not until Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging over.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

The money on the outside is leaking into the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to a reorganization of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates running for the same place.
This recently refurbished suburban district of Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a second-round seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally shredded in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement kicked off a fight to fund the campaign between major party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraiser Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a widely followed March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. should punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraw
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to call on US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the sanctions are only being considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue at a similar meeting last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent the movement towards migration.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, effectively ending any consideration of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
HISTORY
The next thing to do could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller also reportedly directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If a majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to stand before the electorate again, and perhaps ultimately with a jury of equals.
There are many of those “ifs” and I do not want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr. Trum – nor of those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, only that the West opposed and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflation, and the impenetrable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing a few of these points of inflection.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspapers reported that last year he secretly proposed filming the president and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently ordered investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for Congress that Mr. Trump will call for accountability?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that used to sit in my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on that table with a crocheted cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before confronting Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers are on Thursday hosting the Rapids from Vienna, knowing that their victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrelo earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Group G of the European League.
Knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season to a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game believing we could do something and we got the point.
We might have been able to steal the game in the end, but overall, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
On Thursday, there will be another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
“The past year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there’s some good feeling.
The boys are good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let’s hope that we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women Can't Sleep for Fear of Retirement
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what concern they wanted, few people spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the respondents in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for caring if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: At the root prevent legal battles.
Engage healthcare professionals to determine a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals satisfy your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider giving you the power to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your bills if you are unable to.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in your hand."
Man shot several times by air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by shots from an air rifle as he returned home after a night out.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a “random act.”
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Since communications were interrupted, aid workers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongale province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches over 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowalija, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: Severe quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, was hit by a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of Mentawai Island, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sara Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president candidate Sara Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest, a report published Saturday by the state police said.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and is held on a $500 uninsured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself “innocent, of course,” the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be in prison for up to a year and be fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a one-day prison term and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time that a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of alcoholic weapons associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in the quake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of the crash.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare federal crime that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, where he was hit by pedestrians and cyclists who found him on the road in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted severe bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the Saipova federal grand jury hit a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and counts of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack called for “significant planning and thoughtfulness,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as “ugly, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlichi, Hernano Ferruchi, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damini".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in the New York federal case in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, on an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a genus from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be reported in his hospital room, police said.
He is not guilty of 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept the conviction for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipovl's defense team has previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to “mobilize the People’s Army” during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to “feel the pressure” of Euroscepticism, as one of the members of parliament suggested Therese May should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone has said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would so far “get out” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Ms. May in the reconciliation of her deeply divided lines is highlighted by the Tories’ propensity for remaining members to join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan "Chequers" amid the attacks of Brexit supporters, the EU supporters and the rest of the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign rally in Solihull that he wants to "reject the Chequers."
He suggested that Mr Farage should have won the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must throw out the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to bring our own laws to our country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and that they want to stay is completely inaccurate."
Conservative and Brexit proponent Andrea Jenkyns was also in the running, addressing journalists with the words: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually those who took to the streets and chose us.
Please discard the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement, May said: "Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the gatherings that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are preparing to disapprove of the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘This is not going to happen to you.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of betrayal of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A number of activists hailed the "Tories against Brexit" banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis has complained to the Conservatives about the security issues they experienced with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plan, for the unrestricted state at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “seriously consider” running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a direct meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It's been at the center of speculation for some time now that it could be opposed to Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means the woman at the head."
Man arrested for the murder of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the shooting with the death of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, seeking help in identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was killed on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims sustained a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday at 247sports.com.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the crime scene and owned a gun and killed Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the top 10 last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of World Champion after order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's order would "play a big role in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to enter the market at the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a wheel-on-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to hardly leave the free interior in danger of lagging behind after a double move in defense of the third offense.
Max Verstappen started from the last row and was seventh until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race as he relied on his tyres to reach the fast finish and beat Kim Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally reached boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he's the real gentleman who let me through.
“The team did a really great job of achieving the formation finish,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body speech.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "evil and ugly and insincere."
“The only thing that can happen is the nice thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil, ugly and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at posting and leaking information to the public and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave any information?
Remember her answer...did you leave the document to the public – ah, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it went through earlier in September - but Feinstein said the information came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t let her story go public,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, which she was looking for."
However, her denial did not come with the approval of the president, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: “Let me tell you something – it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a bad body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, the ugliness, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they have to overcome in order to get to power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 <0xCC><0x81> 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giantse against Dundee
The Dundee Stars bought out Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5 and 3.
In the early minutes, the Giants came ahead of two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to the draw, and Dwyer returned Giantse to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who came from behind and defeated Dundee with a 2–1 draw in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season for two teams, and Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, assisted by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford's assist to double the lead with Beauvillier four minutes later.
At the inaugural opening of the game, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie to equalize at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giantsi finished the first third with the lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The homers regrouped and Bouchard once again brought them to an equalization in measuring the force naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to lead Dundee's first team at the end of the second third, and he took care of the win when his team was already on halfway to winning the last third of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, are the hosts of Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid an earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been declared a hero after he was killed while ensuring a safe take-off of hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed, and many are said to have disappeared after a major quake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Severe earthquakes continue to affect the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiar Sis Al Jufri Airport's control tower, which was fluctuating heavily.
He remained to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air on Flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Siggi and Boutonga has been limited.
“It is believed that the death toll continues to rise, as many bodies are still under debris and many could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached heights of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency vehicles bring bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being looted all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is seeking to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is driving like missing after plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man is driving as missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it was unable to track any of the passengers since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in attempts to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to break through the water that cut them to the waist to the exit in the event of the plane being sunk.
He said the stewardesses panicked and yelled, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working nearby on port repairs also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters of water.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have been killed in accidents involving PNG-registered air carriers over the past two decades, but that none of them included Air Niugini.
Analyst Exhibits Timeline of the Night When a Woman Is Burned Alive
The prosecution on Saturday ended a case in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used the data from his cell phone to plot a puzzle about the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "struggling because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The data from the cell phone indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Aware Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based singer-songwriter The High Breed claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Fugees and Commona are reborn in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another black woman?
New York babysitter sues couple for cancellation after "racist" message
A New York babysitter sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her “again a black woman.”
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the accusation with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned after her arrival on her first working day in 2016 that her children’s new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“There’s not a single black woman,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "unpleasant" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice for, as she claims, the fact that their then-ex-parent, who was a New York African-American, had done her job poorly, and that instead of her, she had done her job poorly.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work and then went home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for resignation and seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month period for which she was originally engaged, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The pair responded to claims that they were racist, saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was reasonable to do, fearing that she would not be trusted because of the insult later.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her in a message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said that his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to hurt someone who’s in a situation like this.
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, a new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone’s skin before publication to read the book for the first time.
It's very funny what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC filmmaker before being inspired by the little plumber to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
“He was quite a man and he wasn’t a praiser,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it all felt like an accomplishment of his own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is actually your job.
I think Paddington's success looked that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, he always attributed his merits exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter died and we had to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“He’s called over regularly to say he’s really bad and to believe he’s not going to get away,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad asked me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
What I've done.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart function slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and then everything went off.
All I had to do was sit and wait knowing what was going to happen next.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already saddened by the loss of her daughter at the time, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I let go of my head, and tears were always falling down on my face.
It's hard to explain, but in flight I felt a strong sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages of women in sorrow on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who are left without loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile that awaited her brilliant career.
“They all remembered him for his smile.
“They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy.”
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in a “really dark state.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with the cards “so that people would know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don't sit in silence and you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davies' longtime friend, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom and when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t look them in the eyes and he didn’t want anything else.”
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to cross it: “All this leaves a big hole in the family.
What's wrong with us?
But we will continue to fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is about to end as the FBI launches investigation
"I thought we might be able to bring a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for and a time-limited and extensive investigation," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "crash" in the midst of a bloated foreign policy.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their inconvenience is driven by the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections are coming in just five weeks, November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the country’s highest court election.
George W. Bush constantly invites senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its own report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break through with a decisive vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees is 'declining' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Referring to data from the Ministry of the United Southern Alliance, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 evacuations last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors are tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of the refugees from the north eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrants to be illegal, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are still technically at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang at talks that focused on stagnant denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work to liberate the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it does not take into account that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh ‘Hysterical’ Says He Is Incapacitated For Supreme Court Service
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t but think that a woman, if she ever behaved like that, would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally derailed claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and suffocating as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him a "gross and coordinated blackmail" organized by the Liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved she could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because she showed she had prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if he will try to revoke Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi slammed.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not capable not only of being in the Supreme Court, but also of the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from the Roe v. Wade trial, as she was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings for confirmation, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’”
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, anger that has accumulated for months and years and all of this cannot be eliminated without pay.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be the CEO and who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique that, when she gets angry and starts crying, the person she’s talking to says, ‘Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was excellent."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is how it felt to me, once when I was crying because of inexpressible anger, an older woman <0xCC><0x81>s cold manager who I was always a little scared of and dragged down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another.
They were called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had already been withdrawn, she was lagging behind in fundraising and vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1000, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she said she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions and gratitude to the people who supported her, with frustration over the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and with anger over sexism and contempt for her.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder’s media reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what he's gonna put on my gravestone.
"She was crying."
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The start of the trade war between the United States and China has shrunk and, while the battle is far from over, the gap between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, sparked the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week emerged with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated in some way, and recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised the United States to respond to the blow with a blow, and the world's second-largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington’s withdrawal could be achieved by waiving demands, but public submission to the United States would be too inconvenient for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic downturn in both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers thought,” said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic Reconciliation and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic Reconciliation.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the reconstruction of a country destroyed by a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to restore the normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and existence have now been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, winning the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole pair 3, sent the ball into the water on the first hit, leaving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of the 4 players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth kicked out Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop tears today.
The year was hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the cup again.
It's all about the team. I'm happy that I could help," Garcia said, full of emotion after the European victory.
He conveys the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in individual games on Sunday with a score of 2&1.
“I’m incredibly proud of winning over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find a way out over the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance by his team, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain moments, we have given resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm skipping the gate to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll fight each other, I'll work with the PGA Americas and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to take off people's hats.
We're overplayed."
