The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the pastry company
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD councillors in the capital will, it seems, have to overcome the obvious language barriers in order for the members of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed fellow SDGs.
The period Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz "examined" the members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague’s political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the metropolis’ most well-known characters, situations, and causes.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand those known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
“I’m rather a novice in Prague politics,” Culture Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said during the “colleague” terminology exam.
And as for the political veteran, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted equally.
Maybe you know the concept of "golf hole".
"Perhaps it's the only expression of all those you've asked me that I use from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't work slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board chose six examples, particularly those that are especially related to Prague’s municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the bakery", "bullet nut", "treason of the capital" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to the test and a fourth, Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who will be in charge of education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, refused to do so directly.
“I don’t get into these things or think about appreciating how civic Democrats have fun.”
“What really matters to me is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As it has been seen, Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly would not have realized that the previous title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The word "Voldemort" does not say anything to Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>; the only term he came up with in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: "But I know it for the news."
“I’m going to have to aim for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environmental Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "go to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plach<0xC3><0xBD> that it is the headquarters of the companies in Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such a vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the Social Democrats there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
“I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we don’t have anything similar.”
“Better, among us, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or play word games with names,” says <0xC4><0x8C>SSD president Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose party partners call Hulda.
“At school I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za, but I don’t know if my classmates also call me that,” says his own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party mates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they partnered before the misleading elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") from some of his teammates.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the Social Democrats tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulinsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of Fucking Rights" appears to recall that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in Law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of “witches”, as published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an older age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so as not to harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such a bell."
“It is not isolated from healthy young women either, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of West Africa’s state of Burkina Faso, works in a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure”.
He issued an information leaflet that should help avoid witch hunts.
However, this has a glue.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” warns Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil that is used for ritual anointing.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to “eject the evil spirits” from the woman.
The isolation of “witches” is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying, “Human soul-eaters have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in the Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging hunt for witches who had allegedly been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by means of black magic.
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, the military and the president’s personal escort, were forcibly taken to the president’s property in Kanilai by men and women randomly chosen from the Gambian peoples,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the people arrested had to drink a pocim of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive the stay at the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
The tenant of Bakala: heated with coal stoves and signed a higher rent
The man, aged and old, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-storey leases: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving a sentence.
The three of them have just taken a step towards liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-bedroom apartment with a separate second-class kitchen.
“In addition, he does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler,” the man points out with his finger in his son’s new contract, on which he has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains, half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, the date on which it will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes an ademen.
“Everybody says something,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and was already full on Tuesday at nine o’clock.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to you a number picking machine.
"Lease 2011", you can read on a bright button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost does not give time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly after, an elderly marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for settlements, insurance issues, and similar matters.
The letters with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava at the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes a 15 to 38% increase in rent on the cards.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been running for a week, so it’s starting,” they respond, after briefly doubting, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The liberalization and the former floors for Bakala miners are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the elections, it was already addressed loud and clear by the Vice-President of the Parliament, from Ostrava, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and now they appear continuously in newspapers in the area.
“Twenty years later, I want a new ground.”
“I didn’t even change the damn bathroom plate,” the man mentioned in the introduction says.
According to the workers, at the moment, more than nothing comes retired to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the discount on the February rent for the remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15.
However, the window of the mining “liberalization” certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about forty or fifty people for the rental in 2011,” the window worker said.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and in its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge will have to resolve the matter.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only way to proceed possible and fully in accordance with the law," RPG said in a statement.
"Here's not going to judge anyone," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I don’t have the means to go to court,” he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
The rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rentals still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the renters, the main reason for the increase.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, there will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square metre per month," it says on the screen.
Only increased by 38% the 400-story rental of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square metre,” RPG says.
At 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not impact rents, but will scale between four and eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent rise (see the graph) back on the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to the people who sign the lease increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need childcare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that in its interior also hides a small nursery with everything of its own to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees have been able to visit it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from which many well-known buildings from Brno came out, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
The company employs about 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the framework of its social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The miniguard was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-guarding is financed through the European Social Fund within the framework of the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (equipment of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), the company Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the mini-guardia in operation with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present throughout the day for their care. The kindergarten currently accommodates children with no age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "miniguardia", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-guardia program are comparable to the usual pre-school teaching program.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firm companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s interiors
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies resemble the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals dubbed it "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, one observes a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors improves.
Snake and twisting of forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia, emerged from the remodeling of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the industrial rich Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, consisting of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
The architect Josep Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project came up ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Güell Park, where other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic form, the locals soon after its completion dubbed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of the squirrels".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of construction hide religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation fans and typical fireplaces.
Its forty-five-degree inclination may be strange.
During construction, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> did not respect the building standards of the moment at all and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years after its completion, the town hall was so impressed with the result that it asked to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate in this way without renouncing the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, not only obtained a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> plays with the light, white and blue tiles that cover the interior patio and candles.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the dam, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, pensioners and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of the entrance of other buildings of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real ambience of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit them at home.
How to choose mattress and somier: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the mattress.
First of all, they must be complemented perfectly in order to adapt to specific users.
Numerous elements come into play during the selection, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and the basement are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that usually does not have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more often.
If the channels in the center are not properly ventilated and, above, are on a firm base, they keep inside the moisture.
When choosing a bed, it also influences habits.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
“Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep here as well.”
"For their itchy shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
“These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who time problems with the nervous system, so they receive wrong information from the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other clients, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastics.
This “miracle” works in a very simple way.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard game.
It simply sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also acts as a protection against wounds.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shriveled to the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, expert at Cechu <0xC4><0x8C>aloun<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC5><0xAF> a dekoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been specializing in the issues of mobile sleep and health for many years.
In the double rooms, each needs its own mattress and mattress, so during the purchase it is necessary to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the sleepers at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with inner springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"By touching it with your hand or by accommodating on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticed," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of mattress.
The fully padded bedrooms, where the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can’t wash their casing, which is often done today.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a butter.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattress covers with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout their perimeter, so when opening them remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling on larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress can look like a fight between a weight and a moo.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, does he have a firm board?
Never, never!
As much for the beds designed to spend a night visiting.
However, you should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes on the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulated sheet sockets containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although it is always better to use a socket with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar zone may be reinforced and their regularized.
Articulable sheet mattresses should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to the laying.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by the manufacturers of mattresses that, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are dreams with cross structure or tablets with the so-called multitorsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that, even if you use the right mattress and sommer, if you use a bad pillow (large and "wrinkle"), most of the benefits will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder pad or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
The petroleum-based raw materials with which the polyurethane foam is made are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers employ soybeans.
“Biologically, in the case of mattresses, it means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" themselves with plant extracts of breeze, so that the mattress sheath absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the sheath.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
The favorites right now?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various stiffnesses of cold foam and viscoelastic allow to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as medical means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and sleeping bags.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The age of viscoelasticity with an open cell structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during take-offs the astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used on mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for cushions that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people’s tracking devices to control their children.
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
For the moment, the device has the approximate size of a watch case, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people feared the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the available means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We are all trying to tell ourselves that this is not about spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone’s pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases.”
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "cajita" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> warns about the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.”
“In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check if the child is carrying some kind of electronic device that can reveal their location.”
"It's the phone now."
“As the use of tracking devices goes on, you will also look for them, as their sale will certainly be done with a lot of advertising.”
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even in the event that, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve as a help.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If it suffers damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices have an inclination meter integrated, so if the person simply slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a similar size to a slingshot box or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
“In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device.”
“Or that identifies him after a certain amount of time, which can make the police save time,” he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the check of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechanics to surround the whole Czech Republic. But it only lasts two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to arrest explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the mecha is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosives mecha from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million kroner.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha by saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of mecha per year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnics of the army, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is nevertheless decided that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives each year also all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to be exempt either from the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of mecha.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
On the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the engineer or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 mentioned above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even the practice of firing for money is limited.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also fail to understand that we repeatedly buy such amounts of mecha."
“But it’s their decision, and they’ll know why they act that way.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that we as a company try to satisfy,” admits Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, the commercial director of STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defended the hundreds of miles of mecha by also saying that he will have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, of STV Group, indicates that the mecha only has a shelf life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
“If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,” says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry’s shopping mall, said in a statement.
Just for comparison: the annual mecha consumption of the pyrotechnics of the police, who eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its useful life is over.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wicking can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current: it will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now being bought "bad".
So far I am still living from the contacts that I obtained thanks to the contest
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun in the sale of his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
Her success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved traveling.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he reunited with seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan he bought a house that was half demolished consisting of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“Currently, the value for money of the accommodation in our area pushed me to do something about it,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned invested them back into the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," the number one businessman said last year.
“This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped greatly by winning the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ contest,” Pytloun added.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” she recalls.
It certainly recommends everyone who wants to try some company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, until now, he still lives on from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
“With some people I met thanks to the contest, I started collaborating regularly.”
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
A total of about 70.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition.”
“It’s not, much less, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the entire team.”
“Only my name appears in the foreground,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had at Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dispelled by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Company of the Year", last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all of my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” says the winner last year.
The story of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of property during Communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the media competition.
“Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand as significantly better, but also foreign partners started to value collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year maybe it wasn’t just a sign of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also gained recognition for its commercial results until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“We, of course, do not get rid of this situation either.”
“Income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must, at times, adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company’s profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut spending it was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained magnificent ratings at national fairs,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues increase again and, with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement hopes to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that reveals the ridiculous norms
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous norms.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it checks the insured's taxes," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is part of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny’s business tournament for the fourth time and it is beginning to create a hobby among the general public as well.
While last year’s edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it practically reached 4,000.
And it’s not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that need to be respected simply to trade.
“Perhaps in the number of roles required for tax returns we are in the world first,” says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business standards has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in 74th position, i.e., eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated in the same way every year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year’s survey, more than one hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations were submitted that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s 70 proposals is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the competition Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state is constantly putting an obstacle to entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek announced.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in drinking water.
In 2007, what bothered people most was the employer’s obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e., the communication to the office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was removed in the so-called green card law.
And the third one is the winner.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A New Category Recognizes Socially Responsible Companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way, we want to support companies that are concerned with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the Vodafone company, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the Vodafone Company’s main competition of the year 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, in other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery that is especially concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the staff; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition ended up in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without cutting wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce as little impact as possible on the environment,” explains entrepreneur Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports the work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
“In addition, we support the Persona in Difficulty Scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community,” says company representative Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
The laundry company Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a c<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD> from the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affect their pension funds, is also mentioned.
“We provide benefits in food, transportation, skills improvement and leisure,” says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>, of the winning construction company of Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l Czasch in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically named who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
Organizers removed forms that were incomplete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company responsible for the year contest, but they are not disqualified from the Vodafone Company of the year contest."
“Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the main Company competition of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Farm Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have made several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in recent days.
The detectives married a local media businessman and real estate businessman Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of the rights in such a way that the auctioned land would be received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay half a million kroner to Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribes during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen's chief of attorney general Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1> told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo, adding that at the moment it cannot disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it was able to influence the public auction, given the little official information, it can only be speculated.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> responded to Pravo’s questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen’s headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the law on land" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
“These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their return, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced.”
"Depending on the bids, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest bid," said the Fund's spokeswoman.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information about who was going to submit the call and, given that he is also an interested person because he acquired various rights of refund, proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on top.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund some planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where a large road to the industrial area of Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> pole should be built.
Later, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the very historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, supplements for heating and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month from the portfolio from January onwards.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas around 2%, in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for the supply of water and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should be about 100 crowns more per year than it is now.
However, major electricity suppliers lowered prices, as support for the production of renewable energy, in particular photovoltaic, has increased.
However, the gas increases moderately, especially at a time when the heating is used most and therefore the consumption is higher.
In this case, they should also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are gaining momentum across the country, the price change in central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, homes in Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay an additional 50 kroner a month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional kroner a year.
Residents in Prague will also have to withstand a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Prague residents will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
Rent prices for 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation will end in January, can rise considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 floors in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, will increase the rent by up to 100% from January.
The company will take the courts to those who disagree with the new lease.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year by up to 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in fashion, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the beverages that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the relapse are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to drink them."
"Now the fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," says the head of pediatrics at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"When they manage to grab a bottle of your father's milkshake, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage of being smooth with juice and not smelling as much,” he explains.
This is confirmed by Motol University Hospital spokeswoman Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Normally, it's either Fernet or rum."
“These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren.”
“In some cases, they use shaving cream that they picked up at home,” Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> adds.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, they are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years old who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
“She started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus a mix with ecstasy,” the department doctor said.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother wasn’t surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak properly of dependence.
“An alcoholic is a person who has been chronically addicted to alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.”
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n explains.
According to spokeswoman Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, up until mid-November 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the Motol pediatric clinic this year.
However, statistics show only those who come with serious poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after ambulatory medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which the children simply meet after school and drink booze, for Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n there are three seasonal ups and downs to mention: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink from bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
“On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at a time,” adds Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible relapse at home.
Morning headaches, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, are avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and with nutrients that the body lacks.
"These take it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
“They only show confusion about where they are,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n says, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The transfer in an ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients costs about tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when in the visit I tell the children directly how much their intoxication has cost and that they would have to spend the entire summer in a job for young people so that you earn enough to pay for that night,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n adds.
Health insurance, in your opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually pays people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft found in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the aircraft Casa C-295M, departed Tuesday to Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that such a device is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for internship or demonstration flights.
It is the L-159T1 two-seat version, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seat aircraft.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k, of the defense press department, says it is not yet known when the planes will physically withdraw from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investment or contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 bilayers were exchanged in their current state," he told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army is not left without two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for the amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS committed to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that it will serve for the pilot practices of NATO countries.”
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they will be used in this framework,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek says.
The newspaper Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call a bid for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of House aircraft is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger may be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to the age of 60," said co-author of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the 1994-2009 period, she followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same chances of having prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic in the snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was covered in snow on Thursday.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and the takeaway machines circulated all night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and cars, as well as the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK).
A truck crashed at mile 91 and two industrial vehicles collided in the 93.
Several cars also ended up in the cradle.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must slowly circle after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and incorporate into kilometer 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
There have been several kilometers of clogs formed.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, just off Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
Stauages are forming, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congested <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and N<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
At 8 a.m., another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three quickly.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, it can already be used on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to traffic in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska, snow languages are being formed in Brno and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
It is not yet clear when they will open to circulation.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nska, caution is required in the area of the B<0xC3><0xAD>lé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads of the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimetres of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall is gradually falling in the Czech Republic.
U.S. Soldiers Have a New “Smart Weapon”
The U.S. military is using a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known at the moment only by the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that it will “change the progress of the game” to their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with an extremely precise pointing.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually work like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall or trench.
Without a doubt, you can not use normal protection and, when you throw your deadly metal chips rain, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say they measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pushed, the gun is loaded and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus less one, two or three meters,” Audette said.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, which had previously been scattered throughout the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, plus the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure.”
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday sparked joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of Frankfurt’s economy section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that it has earned a “Global Player”.
This is a “major recognition to the location.”
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The management previously informed the city of their intention.
“Of course we have offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
In the end, the economic reasons produced the fall.
Thus, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and the landlord of the building are shown cooperatively."
The building previously used by Fujitsu on the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Verticale" were part of the remaining Marienbader Platz buildings for ten years of a controversial construction project of the seaside town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and valuation companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then merged Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries here will be Fujitsu Services and a company under the name TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plan, houses, among others, the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is increasingly taking over Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The WikiLeaks revelation platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former U.S. server and are currently searching for an internet homeland in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks kicked out of Amazon server."
“To speak freely in the country of freedom,” the revelation activists said via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday.
Just before, the internet company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained: “Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has a problem with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council of the country had threatened Amazon with boycotts, the British "Guardian" reported.
“I had wanted Amazon to take these measures earlier, before previous publications of classified information through Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman also called for the platform to also ban the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and reckless process of WikiLeaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently described the investigation in Sweden as a plot by his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about an assassination of Julian Assange."
That’s why he fears for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee claimed that the person responsible for Wikileaks revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, said Assange should "be murdered" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, there is a big dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had asked for the secretary of state to resign, in case she was responsible for ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks recently.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy distribution director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed exceptionally responsible, the White House announced.
Travers is therefore responsible for developing the “important structural reforms”, which are necessary in light of Wikileaks’ leakage.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of Wikileaks.
“We have done everything possible to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream shops are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream shops has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
From the gelator and from the gelato.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice creams.
The freezer removes the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the barbell and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of their machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream shops has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special more day courses on chocolate ice cream and internships at the home ice cream shop.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art from California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of their bars ice cream, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and at the moment cools it down to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises them to look away from the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not just natural ingredients", has probably used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably gum guar, guar bean.
Of course, ice cream can be made without a stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound of granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
“All suppliers will try to glue flavored ingredients into their merchandise.”
"However, they must ever experience it."
Be it with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mucus and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They also carry out the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
That you know better doesn’t necessarily depend on you having more tofu or fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to know from dried fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of the ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream making is an artefact problem: Peanut puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe must be lowered.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a tool that determines the amount of sugar from the types of fruit (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle on grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
Not only does it help the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all the automation is left out as far as the small folder.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his peers from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were an uncontrollable mini-first giant.
“In all the courses,” says Master Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
Currently, this issue is formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the EFSA group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert have also been hired for years at the Ilsi association.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated on the Efsa testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and mimic the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed his side.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which made the General Environment Office as well as an EU Parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, is used, provided that they are of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you have to expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
On this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire GM plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how are you going to find them?” asks the accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the U.S. and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
“The industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tube behind him.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators arrived and began to take down a large piece of the northern wing.
Stuttgart’s land was never the same again: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became debris.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rugged soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, aged 43.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They mustn't disappear."
She is excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be disgrace, they would grind the gravel or send it to the trash,” he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the landfill company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downside.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the cut 80 kilogram maze, at a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, in charge of projects.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and above.
The Stuttgart stone of impetus has long since become "the wall" or in the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
Ascend to its all-terrain, make a tour of its great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And she's a stone lover.
It accommodates 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures all over Germany.
It is said to be the largest antique stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic cut sandstones.
“They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge,” he explains.
White lily, yellow, warm, enthusiastic.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Note a lot: Red sandstone, an anterior piece of Karlsruhe station.
And it goes on.
"Beautiful travertine."
In the past, the mazes belonged to the Tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the St. Blasien church, toba from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones earlier and moved them with a simple piece of equipment and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people told the stone dealer to make stone quarries, a sculptor, a carpenter, a glassworker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting for talent around great potentials
There is an active influx at the buffet.
16 students flock around the breads, the tomato soup and the sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivally and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: to hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities don’t provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to attract exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins the talent.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, gums and folders with the VW logo.
She explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and work for students and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can get to know students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
“The main point previously was in the technical projects,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be advertised and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 vacant engineering positions.
And, according to VDI’s forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even more.
In the auditing and consulting company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the talent hunt.
Organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG’s subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election on the exit.
Only the cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For the talent hunter Dykta the notes give results.
“To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.”
“Some are close to their end, and they want to request to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized businesses, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for solar technology maker Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or perform your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: Personal environment, smooth hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t normally offer it,” says Stübe, the chief of staff.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child support or good opportunities for promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what you ask the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager, also expects extra points in her ranking for her job seekers.
“I think the applicant is particularly focused on the external rankings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the hierarchy of the sector it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the staff itself.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with a gang,” Kriegler says.
Obama to Stop New Oil Drillings
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strict ban and thereby inadvertently annulled its previous plans.
Also on the Atlantic coast there are new drillings that are currently closed.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What prompted this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the unhappiness that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new drills in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the US’s dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not been completely clear who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of lawsuits.
An investigative committee commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various peteroler consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which has been accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is radically reforming.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the consulting firm BDO - before Wednesday's mining ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new mining projects will soon be extended, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil maroon, it smells like a gas station: Millions of litres of crude have destroyed nature in Nigeria’s Ogonilandia.
People live from the theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari likes it.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist reassured reporters: “Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil stains float on the surface.
I used to catch shrimp here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonilandia, is considered one of the most desolate regions in the world.
On the path of the river route that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, who dips his hand in the water, will pull out a few full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark strawberries, sadly isolate the palm trees that bump and hang their palms.
In vain, flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the outer barrier is silenced, it expands a kind of ghostly calm from an earlier paradise with a gasoline scent.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Hurricane Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
There is a war comparison.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni has been a battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium employed in 1993, because it would be too dangerous.
Even today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is forbidden: While pumping daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, a size three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields were quiet in Ogoniland.
Every two hundred meters stood out steel platforms like strange water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, says Akpobari, then he sends a constant jet of oil into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres have been poured into the delta ecosystem over 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the wreck of the Exxon Valdez ship 21 years ago, into the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, ecologists see heads about to break and leaked pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world, scientist Richard Steiner blamed the consortium in 2008: Only the failure rates of pipelines are “on a multiple greater than elsewhere.”
In a place, which seems to be forgotten by far, a workshop full of oil under the open sky appears, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drills, sometimes spread arbitrarily on the ground, a fire burns: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: “It brings us 34,000 naira,” about $22.
People in the delta are taking advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: That’s how they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from “the bunkers”, who called the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil a day are lost in the entire Niger delta.
Only a small part of the provisional stockpiled raw material is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, which also include politicians and high military officials, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to population management or the loose mode of production.
“If the oil tankers did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no robbery, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only a consortium deduction appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special army unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them with arrest, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This damned invention has completely torn our country apart,” Akpobari said.
Researchers Detect Dangerous Factory Defects in A380 Engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities saw a major safety problem in some A380 engines thanks to their investigations, and they warn of a possible factory failure.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, ATSB authorities announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic failure in the engine.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline is starting legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that allowed more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine brand has lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept about three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa dismissed the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada Across the Country Causes Chaos in Traffic
Totally white Germany: From day to day it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice Germany: Nearly all of the country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15 centimeter thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snow removers are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind gusts sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water levels 1.2 meters above their usual level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partly 30 centimeters of fresh snow falling and cold, strong winds are responsible for tearing it down.
There were many trucks and cars trapped during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt police authorities reported major riots on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected both the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees falling on lanes or broken rails and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, a spokeswoman for Fraport said 40 flights had been cancelled.
The snowshoes are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 country beds prepared for them.
On many streets, there were already many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred due to snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was parked.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after taking a turn with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be getting softer and dusty and will therefore tear into soft streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank recently arranged its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt banking district; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the re-emergence, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims, based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
“We always check to see if you should own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them,” he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution resigns from its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached some <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper’s famous “Greentowers” towers at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold on a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been revealed at this time, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourners for dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies could not be found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the scene of the misfortune, but no sign of survival was discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there was no possibility that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the glowing sunshine of Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
They kept quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothes and surfboards.
The flags waved halfway in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the boundaries of the genre with his epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods of life when his enemies are out of his misery.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are taken by as many as one or two sentences or a pair of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backdrops offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a pity that they cannot discard each other.
Director Winding Refn views his savages and the "Pusher" drug-trafficking trilogy as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a bit more humour in the mainstream or a bit less brutality of the art house.
A cerebral mass and bursting pits cannot deter most of the fans of art cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shut up there again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that is why there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is given just a moment of relaxation and his glacier images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, preserves something as innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents the loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this subject until controls are allowed.
At midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with North Korea's help in the cube, hidden in a valley that goes out of the river.
According to information from the CIA’s U.S. international intelligence service of late April 2008, a current reactor under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar was designed very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique is hardly useful for any other purpose than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor was recently in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than at the time, the puzzles grew bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that he barely saw signs that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a “supposed reactor,” although they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “pleasant.”
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The Syrians quickly cleared the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and cleared the ground in consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been man-made.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors at the moments just after the attack, which must have a higher informative value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not come to market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always hinted that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection of the Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also has a strict silence.
“We will never comment,” Ehud Olmert, the prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not produced results since June 2008 and "is progressively turning into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally there is a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, by which the IAEA sails.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in intelligence, which must be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not publicly disclosed what equipment is involved, what functions they have, or if they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as internal, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which are most likely one of the suspect objects.
Possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, Syria is thus barring entry to all three IAEA sites.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to be afraid of a record that the U.S. has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three locations and the cube on the banks of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the equipment may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is “no sign of sensitive activities,” uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for pumps, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt that the ruins, the valuable trails that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo trucks on the ground disappeared, no one has information about where the debris is.
The IAEA considers it unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from al-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its ability as a radioactive waste zone.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related it to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the photos from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements at the three alleged suspect sites and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has spent several months developing an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors’ interest.
Damascus, meanwhile, is also criticizing this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador scrambles the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most stringent means for nuclear authorities comes.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of “an option I am open to in the future,” but still swaying.
This path is very risky: the majority of the IAEA Governing Council is needed for this, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in times of war
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started summer with the direction of her yet nameless debut.
She wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serb rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations have protested quickly, moving a few days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary at the last moment.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organization of victims of war wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ambassador.
She is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
No love stories are given in the rape camps, and Jolie’s stance on it spreads victims enough on the script.
Her organization, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the dismissal of Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read the script, granted after a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, introduces herself with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
Their content is still inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the war began and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with a torturer".
Jolie’s movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can now achieve peace with the Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the web illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon is finally going to be good for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout out with joy as loud music bounces, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in South Ireland’s Cork, because players throw, and find, ping-pong balls to beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drink game and the discrete computer really don’t make good whiskers.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, to distract himself from the fulminant question, what the future will face him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in their plans, in January they will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad idea,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, “from a shot she got the job of her dreams as an event manager, maybe it’s a good sign,” says the young man and smiles.
Due to bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
The young go: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, forecast economic experts and the Dublin ESRI social research institute.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 immigrants.
A big loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migration wave comparable to the one the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses above all the young, well-educated Irish, for whom so far everything is uphill.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it to an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future emerge because the government is only dedicated to assembly and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your peers go from unrecommended practices to the following ones.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to leading your career,” says the manager.
On his website there are photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, if not it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan knows what it’s like to build something somewhere else.
As there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish construction colleagues in Germany.
They are now building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January we are going to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a little crazy,” he says, as it’s been a long time since he first stepped the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks in cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineers don’t like the complaints they often hear today.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island,” he said.
“Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
“After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple.”

Let go of the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's been working in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But these days there’s one thing that worries him most: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Only, not too much emotion,” he says, and gives a great drink to his beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds very distressing."
“We better call it a very relaxed party, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games.”
The Democratic Routine
It continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is of greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of attitude changes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated mood prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries off the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see graph 2).
Approximately 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but considerably more than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45% trusted their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been sustained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty has only marginally increased in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see graph 5).
About 31 per cent say that they or a close relative have been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has declined since 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are essential for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see Figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela say the same (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the largest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% versus 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the trash
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they happened in a much worse way than feared by foreigners trying to help the country recover from their problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballot papers thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral colleges and acts of intimidation.
Electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, were roaming the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up for defeat.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, said they were “relatively good elections in many ways.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that “we do not think that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The disembarkation is expected to take place in January.
All hopes for the elections have not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who barely has support, if any, has moved to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and more than a million of the earthquake survivors are still living in stores, a great deal of abstinence is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been shown, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving pointers towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity index by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, whether it can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drafting budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner’s death due to a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Accordingly, the 2010 budget will apply to the next year, which will offer the President an even greater margin for action when it comes to spending.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to union wage demands, place it at close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made the INDEC, the institute of statistics, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez moderate these policies now?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, their officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused to forcibly restructure the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped at the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not imply IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of prices for domestic consumption, which looks like a prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is not clear if President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to continue in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not you rebut, calmly, many of your husband’s policies.
Middle-earth for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible, came on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has leaned toward total independence from Taiwan, won virtually 50% of all votes versus 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s vote share has declined by around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD came into contact with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections we could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with flags and light girls in dancing clothes.
Neither did the mysterious assassination attempt of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the elections.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or avenge himself on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean for the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids advertising its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time too, the PPD avoided encouraging sentiments against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy with respect to China had been confirmed to be acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back on track.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
It would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but the first thing is first.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed for corruption.
Between 2000 and 2008, he openly advocated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been graciously welcomed as a PPD presidential candidate, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group that will act as a point of contact between the PDP and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s precipitous approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to be introduced to the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen intervening, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its possible candidates.
The KMT should also take a conscience test.
Mr. Ma’s ratings have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity appears to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will restructure its cabinet, as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PPD suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist Revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives some thought, but respects Grammy rules that he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist."
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was undoubtedly a great breakthrough and, given their light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the way to the success of Norah Jones.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of last year's favorites.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite New Orleans stutterer and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which, for the rest, tends considerably towards fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk earned recognition in the category of big bands, competing against Billy Childs Ensemble's great chamber jazz and ever-risk Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the Democratic leadership of the bassist band.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Classic Album Direction
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for five-movement piano and orchestra, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Nominees with links to southern California include Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical music nominations are divided into thirteen categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" Orrus - Reemi Artist; the Boston Modern Orchestra's "Caquias" and Synergy.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatemente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is dubbed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
“He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestral function category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets the approval of the commission of ordering
The mosque project for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local ordering commission after more than five hours of public testimonies, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and blockades.
However, committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD>s, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Prove that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They just talk too loud.”
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people intervening in favor or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen".
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near zone zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, the imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
Its congregation of about 135 families has been cohabiting seamlessly in Riverside County for years, but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal to the municipal council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it proves that there may be forms of life without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That makes it very peculiar, though it lacks little to be a kind of really ‘alien’ lifestyle,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online Thursday edition of the Science publication.
For a long time, it has been considered that there are six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, given that researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, sparked much speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery “shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of “standard” elements that we consider necessary for life may not be as fixed,” said Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Redo Mil, at Open Keton University.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
“As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them.”
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, to put it some way, appeals to biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that there may be a natural way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found that proves it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early eras of Earth, he said, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“It suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two missing dogs have been found in front of the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Officers said on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two met on Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They've come back with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
“We’re following some leads.”
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make any comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at local competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and were planning to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to exhibit them in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly two-month tour participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer breeder, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick coat and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, endowed with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM gets the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a New York federal bankruptcy judge officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to clear approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become a downsizing studio executives.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to manage its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron President and bankrupt business recovery expert, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial hardships and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
Prior to this spring, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreements, was finally backed by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive “successful fees” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production on MGM, which released only one film this year, and assembled an annual seven- to eight-film slate that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to settle a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep balance in their gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect gaming system, both can mean a significant boost in their gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes decorated with beads, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy is likely to have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with affiliate websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys powered by button batteries are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are guinea pig-sized plush toys that sing a note when their abdomen is squeezed.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to make a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can’t stop.
As far as combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shifting games like Sim<0xC3><0xB3>m Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative hinged feet with locking wheels.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about a lack of volume control.
If you’re an 80s kid, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.

If you are reluctant to give your child their smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), it’s the first major set-up of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game just bigger than a box of glasses, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to arm words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an impromptu word-arming competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.

To buy your child a pet online at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.

A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a town square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing low-pitched orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the corpulent police of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firms!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how beautiful the girls are!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with identical white gloves and olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four stylish hats perfectly placed over the hair tied with blue and white striped hoods.
“Personally, I think they have a normal appearance,” Mr. Tang said, disdainfully.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a discolic snack cart, and watched it with the frown constantly for half an hour, until the walking salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rude policeman a softer, feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle to increase China’s petty respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors punched a passerby after using his cell phone to film them as they disbanded a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the internet, in which it described how to effectively beat criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, an outgoing Shanghai watermelon salesman suffered brain damage after a reindeer with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleanup."
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over 25.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
“First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then comes the temperament "and inner qualities".
The female Chengguan are like florists, he said, and added, "in addition to being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district’s city administration office, is not eager to support that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job notices for both sexes.
Then comes the need for harmonious facial features.
If that means bet, it’s a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disabled or disfigured should not be presented.
“We can’t allow a person to pick up or a squirrel to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his cheeks colored and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His roommate, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said “Our work must present the image of the city.”
They are also not opposed to their fixed-time work, they said, because they harbor larger career ambitions than simply driving out sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many loaves or cups of tofu as possible before being thrown away.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with slingshots.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is more or less the same every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very Routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise from the sellers.
They can only threaten to denounce offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, muttered after false rumors spread that Chengguan officials had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the nighttime incident; 14 government vehicles were turned on or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is barely guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted loudly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened up to the tailgates to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, stayed behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we struggle physically,” Mr. Li said naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the public that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not bring charges against Senator Ensign
The senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that prosecutors at the Justice Department have exonerated Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work by lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said it was “certainly happy” with the decision, which came after a one-year investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an object of his investigation and that it has no plan to sue him for this matter.”
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate Ensign may have conflated to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first released in the New York Times in October 2009 indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve Hampton’s silence and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Department of Justice officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for his public integrity section led by Steve Teuta.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department attorney on Monday and another call later the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins declined to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was “chuckling” the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the Transportation Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesperson Jennifer Cooper announced Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign has wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the judge's death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed court papers outlining the arguments of appeals that will likely occupy courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“According to what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
First-instance judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconicly rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media were “carefully controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury had been led by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have recognized that the coverage of famous cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the way of communication from the courtrooms, something unthinkable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media” in high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appeal judges could be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which are likely to be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them frightening photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticised prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They noted in a rejection of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media were continually firing firewood from the emotion about the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has never been seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.”
His attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous view that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said the appellate courts were often drawn to the arguments about adaptation that was required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made clear that they would require the new media to require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civilisation be a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, this week has sparked a bit of civicism in Washington.
Is it a prelude to a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick turn to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders did not bring any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the forthcoming session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion of the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to win party points.
The president’s deficit committee’s public meeting on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a trial period, surveying each other to identify signs of co-operativeness and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed party war.
The reason why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent evaluations by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and are too deep-rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two parties are at opposite poles.
However, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to how things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections awaken partisan passions, which then become extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make them believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying the unemployment benefit for the unemployed workers.
Following Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the forthcoming session, along with the ratification of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues at the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term, psychology will turn the situation into a confrontational one,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilisation can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and repeal the new health law.
These starting lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit committee's recommendations, which include reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and cuts in spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the hardest jobs in Washington and, in their own assessment, have forcibly put the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected to the panel, suggesting that there are, at least currently, few bases or desire for engagement in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch closely the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they’re losing is likely to change course and seek engagement.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partyism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it raises directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical authority,” takes its share as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he stated: "It's madness, a mistress, a nuisance."
According to surveys, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for foreign diplomats to do so.
“The direct links of the Moscow city government to crime have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional’, and to assert that the government functions more as a cleptocracy than as a government,” the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) crossed by the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the government’s bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
"Luzhkov is at the top."
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are at the second level.”
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS raises money from larger companies, and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s commercial owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the fundraising is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports of men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the group of experts at Indem in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
“But he is a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
On a national scale, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which didn’t happen until late Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed to CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously for a revelation that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest with you, let us not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemeras forced to face the past
In a sparsely lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Reds.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok".
“He was a good leader and cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as “the butcher” for his brutality during the rule of the Red Jemeras, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemeras in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Yemenis surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that first teaches the history of the Red Jemeras to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia mixed court issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Yemeni, sentenceing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Anlong Veng Red Jemeras, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to re-integrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Red Yemenis, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
“For them, life under the Red Jemeras was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is generating divisions within families.”
During the government of Cambodia's Red Jemeras, between 1975 and 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian-Thailand border.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that gave up in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Yemeni fighters began deserting towards the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samp in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest Red Yemeni fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Jemerese officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the flat soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
“These people have gained little after surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised without any concept to do business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeras when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeras was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok gave him to eat everyone."
“But now life is difficult because we have to self-sufficiency.”
The current Red Yemeni court has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin suing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemeres.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases other than those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has centered on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the rule of the Red Yemenis in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that is believed to have killed thousands of forced workers.
During a recent whimsical afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the grassy pasture, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She claimed that if the court summoned her, she would not be presented.
“Cambodia is at peace and stability,” he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Yemenis in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question him.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Red Jemeras, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the high school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeras.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Red Jemeras, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he brought the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemeras retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a black hole rectangle covered by an oxidized tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old cell phone salesman on the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a bunch of mature bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of qualified uranium for armaments
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will relinquish its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for arming a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This demonstrates that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal was “a very significant and important step” taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for armament) and low-enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material ... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence” that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential disenfranchise.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the country’s and its citizens’ progress.”
The Spanish government did not fix the flights of the CIA
The Spanish government did not fix CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed to Guantanamo by Spanish territory, the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "may be able to demonstrate that extravagant surveillance was being carried out over appropriate surveillance."
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which it accused a dozen countries of complicity in human rights violations, including Spain, a meeting was held between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no fixes to intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unexpectedly caught," Aguirre reports on a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence."
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez reported to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern over "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors", rather than over declassified information from the CNI or the Department of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, at a lunch between U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although the Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators for rethinking it "to avoid inflating comments."
The ambassador also expresses concern about the PP’s action on this issue.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations signal negative consequences for the US government,” the statement said.
The confessing parricide complained in the network of the "agobia" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" on the net.
With this surname, which she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the people from which she came from.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies from their relatives.
The young Galician, 30, started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
It wasn’t long before he met another man.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But by the content of the communications, it is seen that his romance fractured, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and musketed, because I have come to work."
“When I said it, it seemed good, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
Then he talks about a message to the phone he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains, “If you don’t like me leaving the baby with my mother, I’ll pick it up when I get back,” she says.
In May, he talks about his return to his people: “This week I’m going to go there, but I’ll only be there until 19, because on 20 I have to introduce myself to a job so I don’t lose it.”
He says that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He's going to be with whoever he should be, that is, with me, and never in my life will I ever think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother," dubious intent given his bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When he types it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
“Caesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other.”
“He’s with me on one side and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he’s going to class almost every day.”
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
“He’s going to go there (the kid) to some summer classes, and so I save myself a bit of kangaroo paste.”
17, Memories and Complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
“Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck yourself.”
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
Of Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the internet there are messages of his on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the MySpace universe, now intervening, where he was called "Muki the Excarcerator."
"Terror in the galley (ep<0xC3><0xAD>graphe)".
The last man who lived with her, a jury, declares his regrets for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe it all happened because he didn't tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the provincial prison of Palma yesterday, from the judicial detention center of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor did he intend to cause any harm to the minor."
Earlier, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase of votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view placed in the general elections because, whether ahead or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation gets in those elections usually doubles that received in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, the figure amounted to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
In keeping with this upward trend, which has been fed by a transfer of votes from the PSC and by the fidelity of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while the CiU would also win less than four (now it would have 9 di 25) and the PSC has none.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP – it now has three – while ICV would stay with one MP or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their re-election at the head of the Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona, one of the administrations with the most budget of 6 million euros.
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get a majority or a chance to turn to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unthinkable that this formation loses its representation in the Consistory of Barcelona - you need to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its voting numbers in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the uprising in the capital Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popularities have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan Cell Provides Thousands of Passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commission of the Police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Laskar and Taiba's "Laskar and Taiba's" (Las) "Las" and "Las"
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the “Operation Kampai” has been “weakened” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level and, therefore, its “operational capacity”.
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their “combatants” can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The stallion is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, so in the investigations involved, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not excluded that in the territory of the EU are carried out in the coming days similar coups that developed last night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested, another was developed in Thailand with the capture of Buthari Butlakant and Siland butyamat and Muyamat Atki.
These were the ones who ran the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents should be in the name of men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the media of the investigation, it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found linking the detainees in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, although the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have been seized with ample documentation.
The PP demands Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and leading to the nationalist economy and to dispense with the adventist, the filo-soist.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he gives to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make himself wanted, because the candidate of the CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to hold in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas holds these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, in order to support an investment "you will have to park all the sovereignist and independenceist speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends to even submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their cellar killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatrician La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage that has caused the institution to the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was employed killed at least eleven elderly people in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center’s letter, the lawyer Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that “La Caritat’s desire would be to be able to exercise the charge against the person responsible” of the deaths but “the legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible”.
In addition to the social disdain that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the cellar in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has since not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrician - that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures may not have at any time been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in the case there is not a single indication that there has been reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself.”
The former "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed him on August 29, 2009, for, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinching an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that he committed using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center has access to the medicines.
The insulin pinch and sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila did not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he embraced them inside giving them lye as he has already confessed to doing with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellist, nor even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the sense that it has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, with success, and.
That is why they say they are making themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday that warned “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
Peripheral spreads have been tightly closed and European banks’ shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses is recovering but motivated by the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take time to lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded to end the public debt purchase plan for ineffectiveness and eliminate all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue their bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God is helping us!
Just as at their May meeting, at which they said they had not even contemplated buying bonds and the markets collapsed, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, he announced the bazuca on Monday and Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, where a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest Beethoven's joy anthem.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice that of the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and strong and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for a Plan of Aid would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury have more than 40 billion in liquidity available than in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the sine die markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, to look like it".
Animo, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The temporary does not lie in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "full-right zero", the judicial board of El Jaenebro of next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and become the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are tuning the legal drum for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over the control of the group.
The founder of the company’s largest business services holding company does not appear to be willing to cede in his litigation to be present in El Enebro’s governing bodies.
He was dismissed from his board of directors by five of his seven children who were appointed directors at the January 18 shareholders’ meeting and whose appeal is registered in the Commercial Registry.
The Judicial Board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the Magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunder within the family <0xC3><0x81>lvarez.
The recourse of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants his five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of the Law and abuse of the law, try to validate and sanitize their official juntaes in the radically void of the 18th.
This argument will be the basis for, once the meeting is held, proceeding to its appeal by considering it to be "full-right zero".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, already unsuccessfully tried for the magistrate to convene a junta in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the substantive question that the judge must decide once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is no date indicated.
Red Bull wins F1 with Siemens secret weapon
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final line of the championship all bet on the Ferrari victory of Fernando Alonso.
Without disrespecting the skill as the driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from the high car competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly chains from manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding faults and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time" the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the squads in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of changes in the bolides.
The Siemens CEO explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s bolides except the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation of this technological refinement madness is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has assembled the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered a “high secret.”
The crew for this task is 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull’s Formula 1, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in circuits, are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety zero.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in trolley cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer science as "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to install 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will be compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain’s vice president, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a barcelonesa, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HP Personal Systems Director also said that the philosophy of installing stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive retail network aims to “improve customer and SME service in buying, care, after-sales and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days.”
“This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical support services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell pledges to ‘steal’ one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and vacates the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a collapse in interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years, its outstanding subject matter.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011, which will run for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without resorting to the FROB’s public aid, is to gain a market share by capturing a million new private customers – 700,000 if you find out who can get out of the bank –, its big subject pending, since until now it had pampered more SMEs and businesses than the retail customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduced costs as a target, and whose challenges the bank will expose them when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its CEO plan Optima, set four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the market situation made it expand one more year.
Customers who let out the savings boxes will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be “very difficult to create jobs”, something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the war of the liability — which penalizes margins — is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cashiers are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity is already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it will be a pressure factor on credit.”
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of the spreads – see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the bank’s trend now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
“Next year everything will move,” he said.
He claims that the capital needs are "high" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important what some bankers already argue as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through breaks, which amortizes the crisis.
ECSC dismisses second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out that there will be a wave of savings box mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentration of Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think most of the mergers have been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be said to be a second round, which are adjustments."
“Most of it is completely done; it may be that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot on that too,” said the director.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the process of concentration is being carried out "as quickly as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in his day Spain, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Banco.
“Signing from 45 boxes with an average asset volume of 28.5 billion to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process unprecedented in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who put it under trial a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" process of concentration and that "goes at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well with the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed people, to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Loter of the 30% of El Prat.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Keep in mind that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel sadly extended the decision to save Greece.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel once again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country, while at the same time forcing private lenders to run with some of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that will enable those measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which he perhaps does not quite agree, from that date the old functioning of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another debt and construction-based alternative, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just a matter of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What is required of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will leave room for more tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this, and his dual manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that we have to put order at home has opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with less serious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sports and Legal Fraud
Bastards like those of Alonso and Ramos before Ajax show ingenuity but unwillingness to escape a sanction.
The purported expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether or not such behavior is anti-sports and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the match (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately wasted time taking out missed lanes to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction for the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clear cards to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned the team's coach José Mourinho with two games and the players involved with different financial amounts.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten, but followed, rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and who in the past has fined its players for similar acts) and to the technical dramatization orchestrated, apparently by Mourinho and historio.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions commit fraud; because, in fact, they are actions that respect the sport regulation, but seem to evade their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that the sporting spirit understands is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that was not endangered with these actions, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that are alluded to by clean play is to prevent the team of the offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not fit what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not made in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage do offenders get in the intentional flaws examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not placed in a disadvantageous situation to the opponent nor profit is obtained in the same game, since obviously the result of the action involves leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it is also not a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, as the team can be eliminated at the first change, and in addition with this act the players meet a penalty game and pass to the second round of cards, in which the suspension by card accumulation occurs with less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it’s not so clear that it’s an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is a part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case that we are concerned, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of legal fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without bypassing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the boundary between ingenuity and fraud is diffuse, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was two self-ejections and the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of bids to capture group Christmas dinners at BCN
The calendar dictatorship this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
The self-sustained celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are proliferating.
Like the turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have resulted in a company partnerships in an offensive of prices adjusted to be able to catch the 30 or more customers.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (when New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the petitions in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely moving for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the stage of lean cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners due to budget issues.
In order not to break the tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the conjuncture, some demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Restoration Board of Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, today, does not dare to vacate what the festivities of this month will look like.
"People think about it long before booking."
"He wants to leave but has the price alerts on," he said.
The business will do well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and remembers that customers tend to drop a step with the crisis, so the range around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 has become a majority in demand.
A survey of various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
“We have done the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
At AN Grup, which is ahead of El Mussol, Attic, QuQuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in turnover from the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the parties.
To their six group menus have added a Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbursts in some companies that re-invite their employees and a feeling that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
But, yes, the illusion of the festivities has not gone down, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at “a faster pace than any other country.”
WikiLeaks leaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the accredited U.S. diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, rather than going up, "decreases", and that the rest of the world's unstable, more nuclear-weapon-producing Asian countries "decreases".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hamper their destruction in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for the unfolding in Washington.
This is stated by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Advisor, James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transportation of materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep a watch.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” said Yuri Korolev, a senior U.S. expert at the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The most novel of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s portal is the ever-lowering US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which called communication with Pakistan "frustrating," said: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid are left unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official with the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end the tacit support of the terrorist groups."
The hunt for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist leader to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the moves and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and follow the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, but is dated November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leaking of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks creator lawyer Mark Stephens said that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization explained, do consider the so-called free-way notification network to proceed to an arrest -- which must be made by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement where they believe it is the case of Sweden and England.
The movement has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconferencing.
They also remember that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s chief of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains in unknown but not silent abode.
On Monday, she gave an indefinite interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which she called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism leader, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to retain Assange’s importance contrasts with views these days proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any of their contributions or aid."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further after he said Assange should “be murdered.”
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he said.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with guineas to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to overcome the same internal uprising in ERC’s ranks, without a north for the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation hideout is insufficient for his relatives to former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is now as diluted as his own mentor and that it can at all cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win the new critics with winks that allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to pronounce on their continuity in secret.
Through cards, and not by hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said he would not consider it to be ratified with half more than one vote, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be a good result "for Bulgaria".
Those close to Carod demand the president more than to make his office available to the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But not having enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a roadmap from here to May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for him promising to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the dome already pretends to be.
The ERC leader recognized that “polyphony” undermines stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty doorcloths inside.
In this line, it turns out symptomatic the article that job counselor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the head of Innovation admitted that the leader will be voted "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to “recompose” the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces from the sector close to Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly at once as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held through delegates elected by vote.
Quitting the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave of 2008 left the management with the task of reviewing the assembly at a specific statute reform congress.
This quote is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing the issue.
Now, without critical sectors stalking, it may be a good time to take it back and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the murder of three women and the discovery of a pair of locked bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the grace shot on the head in addition to the feet and hands tied with wire.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday morning, ejidatarians found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest, on the quota highway Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, on the stretch that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a 50-year-old gentleman, was killed by eight bullets after leaving his house to begin garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a bullet in the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot on the forehead was found the body of a man on a lonely road from the Colony El Naranjo and under the body they found a 25 calibre firearm punched cap.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Golondrina beach colony.
Emergency bodies conducted a thorough search of the other body members, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n warned about the discovery of a corpse that was in the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada area, which was tied hands backwards and with his head veiled.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men, who were wrapped in coffins and left in the drawer of a vehicle in the streets of the fractionation Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n of Zaragoza, was reported, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony he was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in coffins, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning was located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow coffin with blue, allegedly identified with the name Mario Rios.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the neck, the body of a dead woman was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin were detected tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads tied up and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said: "This happens to those who don't line up."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tying of feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Next to him, the officers found a postcard with a message.
China Holds Targets to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The country’s representative at COP16 said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
He said China’s climate change strategy was divided into four categories: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which collects the targets set for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve energy savings, energy efficient use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, several multi-year plans, funded both by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are in progress or have already concluded.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for changing incandescent spotlights by savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government’s scientific adviser on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do more by 2020.
Attached to the legality of the expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the NAP detailed that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is in his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what suits his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission for the Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to come to the Commission of Order of the National Council, where appropriate, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the context of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there was never an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which he will have to be elected his successor.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal,” he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; in the counter "we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he said.
He said that the council will no doubt know how to choose the best or the best leader that National Action requires for the next three years, hence he will hand over the scepter "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute calm and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the rebound that the party recorded in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not time to think about 2012 yet."
"For now it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, so "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations."
Asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called on the Pristinas to reflect on the six-year-olds of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon, start defending them, get out of the closet,” he said.
He felt that the head of the federal executive could make such expressions as he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyberlink with a broader document asking the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said that once the fiscal issue is resolved, a timetable will be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the fiscal issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closed-debate vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years, and have entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are proposing intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to back the initiative.
Among the top Republicans are Senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who completed Senator Mel Martinez’s term.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but have stated they will not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature put your finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants took part in the storytelling
"That of The Sex in the Language I understand, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time it was explained to him.
The finger in the sore... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine writer said sweetly to the public, mostly young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Garro and Monte Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "laga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectologist is convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exhibited a delightful narrative entitled Praise of the Invention, where the finger in the wound is not named but is discovered at one point.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, tells the story of a famous wizard, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, narration that turned to speak then America, the great novel that was told by the Berros who did not from the beginning by the Cathicanists to tell their own chroniclers.
“Cervantes who invented us all [the writers] made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise he would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that he lacked to the brim.”
However, he emphasized "the madmen and the crooks are the ones who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or another, where the fictional literature reaches its peak.
In fact, it is called the "cervantine tradition."
"By his inheritance we are what is counted."
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the FIL’s invitation with her round table The Finger in the Wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed her towards the great scourge of social violence that goes through her country - and shares Latin America - as a result of the disputes of trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs involve a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciences that it yields in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every assertion there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be owners of our thought and to be owners of reality we have to matt: and mattify means many times putting your finger on the wound and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in ideas established and without tone and also bothering the powers that recur in black and white," he said.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has managed to reach the decisive series already on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoling himself with the medal of the sub-champion, he has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he fell by 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closura he also came to the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 overall and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team ended up 2-2 tied in front of the couriers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he got ahead by 3-1 with two chances from Voltere from Volta 3 and failed to seal the title for the final three players.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to break away from the curse and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a fan I owe myself to and consequently the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," he said when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very valid has the previous final, from which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the final we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the strip, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalties for throwing we can already be ready to go out running and party, I think that's not the one.
To know that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that does not worry you, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one tries to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared for it".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion coach and try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and also the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for issuing a visa will change at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, you will no longer need to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and more for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will remain in the Consular Section for less time than in the past.
Also, those who apply for visas at the consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA’s Washington headquarters by experts in astrobiology, described as the science in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present “a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at the same time as us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they will become intelligent beings like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this ability increases the chance that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that “there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will announce the true scope of the findings at tomorrow’s press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon on Saturn), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Opponent 'Block' Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the advent of ‘bipartisanism’, they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it gives rise to ‘bipartisanism’, because now it will be two people, with the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau of Directors, headed by the panist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality of the part of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be re-evased by both parties and with this the opposition coalition ended.
“So far it has come [the opposition coalition], that’s what I’m looking at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress after having been monopoly, now be "duopoly."
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipathism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and are conversing with other peers and peers to make them more, the convergence abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a 'botin' between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
“It used to be just a game, now they’re splitting it between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by co-op agreements, leave out 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, honors the five that see us, separated into different factions, we have decided to unite to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questionable owner of an electric material company.
A further check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electric material company, amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "clearance of accounts to be paid".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had predicted that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Auditorium for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you’re just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Gazette of the State, as the Law states when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury said they have not re-used their services.
The above, after the 25th of July, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid to the Municipality of 42 million more.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgency to serve tourist sites
Tourist businessmen regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced taking care of the image of the destination and reversing the bad that tourists encounter with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn around to nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business one day and have no idea of the money being lost, or otherwise they wouldn’t do the work in such a long time and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so giving preventive maintenance and not just falling into the corrective," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should be given maintenance, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council should change its strategy to maintain well the city.”
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come does not depend solely on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
“There has been no due attention and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed.”
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, tidy and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
“Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned up and put online to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination.”
Requests IP Results to Congress
Eduardo Davalos, president of the CEC, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Labor Legislature that is worthy of and free of agreements between parties and the State Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature has been installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one from the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partyism or paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly inaugurated 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We expect deputies to really exercise their right, free from party-to-party agreements because it is customary for them to make arrangements to take care of their own interests and become carnival appearances of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
That is why he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to advance the Governor in turn.
“We take care that they come to do a worthy job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job generation.”
As for the tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that you have within the state budget to strengthen the State Secretariat of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is inconsistent as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly competes with the agro industry."
In addition, it is required to label resources to detonating tourism projects that help in giving security to the state and in updating to the Law on Alcohols that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A Wizard King is sought
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next King’s Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a crow.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble Colonia Salvador Allende house and live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Because sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have chamba, but we sell mandarin and poppy... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests sized clothes for a year.
"He said to me, 'I'd like this monster,' but I said, 'Let's go see my son,' because it was so expensive," he recalled sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Michael, 8, wears size 8.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the Search for a Magic King campaign, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, about a dozen persecutions have been carried out as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production took place.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment have been seized for production,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following his arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a lengthy investigation that has lasted about a year.
“It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to make the arrests,” Mr. Ruel said.
About 70 agents from the Quebec Security Estrie Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government says should solve the problem of smuggling illegal migrants, will surely face big opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm mostly based on the letter."
“I’m here with a party that has created the granite you pee,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone coming from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
“We are against and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has vehemently rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with clandestine immigrants.
“The Neo-Democrats agree that action is taken against those in charge of clandestine skateboarding and that’s what we want with another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and incarcerates children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and that they treat the country as if it were a plump.”
“They expect Canada to take strong action,” said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to request a vote so that every MP who was going to oppose would explain himself later to his voters.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Research is a matter since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be noted that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for Quebec party critic Stéphane Bergeron to classify the announcement as “a rabbit pulled out of the joke” and as “a last-minute bluffing solution.”
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” it simply indicates.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ president Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace launching a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the general intervenor to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervenor," he concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could give the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project at stake in the Charest Government.
Quebec is also calling on Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to better adapt it to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to motorcycle groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers Under Extreme Surveillance
Several watercourses are being monitored closely due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was an earthquake in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, the houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, there was another earthquake in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the snow melt that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, Quebec’s Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ourarau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julianne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, 10 homes have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civilian security unit is on alert and closely monitors the situation, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
Quebec's Crop Forecasting Centre, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday communicating the strong growths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ourarau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly to blame for Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and on Haitians, as well as for their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an improperly negative representation of Haitians and gross language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day."
The Council has also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
Presenters must communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In connection with the suicide, the defendant Stéphane Dupont had stated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life ' s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a delicate subject in an equitable and adequate manner."
As a result, any culpability has been discarded in this respect.
The last litigation concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had made no donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of gross language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio channel has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, who must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of the highest hearing within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai boxing, climbs to the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance on the professional level.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, held October 23-30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China".
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
“The interesting thing is that I have progressed in every competition.”
"At this step, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sand" is a discipline originally from China in which it is allowed to hit with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The clashes were originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous fighter in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only keep one competition in his career, he will undoubtedly go to the big "King of Sanda" tournament, the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
“This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China,” the friendly boy explains.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"What has won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
$450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Québec Party, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
“That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly,” Québec Party deputy Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how it could benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there has been a collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "lacking rigor".
He noted that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Usually, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the size of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been awarded without competition coming into play; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As published last week Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows identifying more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA<0x2B>, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of James Bay responds to a dynamic of private labor and Hydro-Québec specifically responds to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'energy de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
“You have two options: you can get in touch with industry players and tell them: we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.”
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well-known members of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, who “finance” it, before specifying that it is more about its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More eco-friendly, but deeply sceptical.
The Québec consumer barely trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and believes that this even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they don’t trust companies’ environmental commitment or environmental advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that carry the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are “eco-responsible,” the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, which is currently supported by about one third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information cause 46% of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they also distrust the supposed performance of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
More green and responsible (the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of king of recycling trying to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about wildlife protection.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be door-to-door: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support cycling and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex for the Société Angus and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallel, who were expecting a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois back the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return him his true cinematic vocation, have not gotten what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would, in fact, be below the initial expectations; this could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a 12.8 million request last spring, but applications have since been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and a plan of action to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report about a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation must be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinema Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do call for considerable financial assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has been carrying the burden of author cinema for ten years at its premises of the complex, having financed its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent movie rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalize its customers.
The company Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are driving a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallel, continues to screen films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening the precious film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des deux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they have received.
The veil of the complexed Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. views as the Canadians’ complex with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflect the U.S.’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-U.S. relations when they are going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A September 22, 2008 cable, that is, during the full federal election campaign, tells how far the United States does not get into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations of this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority virtually inherent to Canadians when it comes to dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this “dumbing silence” because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, he thinks, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His journey will help ensure the government’s survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will for the first time register a deficit in the last decade due to a $30,000 to $4 billion recovery plan,” Mr. Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from being replaced or that opposition parties conditioned their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image broadcast by the dramatic series broadcast on the US CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unthinking references are made to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or even kidnappings for the CIA to conduct energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that, during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that it depended “on each case.”
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"Secretariat agreed to revise the file."
Finally, we can mention that moods have warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former close advisor to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered.”
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is echoed.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations in Cancun proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by almost a third of the additional decrease to be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DELs or "LEDs" in English), would be avoided much of the 1.8 billion human tonne of the planet's (Gt) emissions.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary automotive fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 GB to 49 GB.
However, another 5 GB of that amount should be lowered to stabilize, before 2020, the rise in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced even more twice.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those released by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied to countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations regarding fluorescent lamps, as they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluocompact bulbs, but coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billions of dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the “immediate” publication of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, as deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesperson for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed Wednesday to pass the deadline at midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had commented on television that the commission was “continuing to work” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, petitions for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, Gbagbo’s side has the constitutional council’s annulment of “fraudulent” votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces (N.F.) rebellion since the failed coup d’état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire president's campaign, said the UN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the outgoing president's followers from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s grievances.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents consider the country’s highest court not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have given way to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years ago.
The United Nations has warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) data published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third trimester, but they want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and seek employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase of the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (<0x2B>0.9 points in three months, <0x2B>0.5 points in a year), 25% including DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (<0x2B>0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50, a figure of 6.6% with DOM.
Unemployment among people aged 25-49 has only been stable, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, <0x2B>0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% in all France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
“It’s easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client showed up.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also jailed one of their close friends, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the late Simon.
In the context of this file, he is also being investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former general director of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misuse of funds and complicity, but he has been left on parole and is forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have accused him."
“The instructor magistrate has taken into account the explanations and released him,” explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director-general of property at Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "trafficking of influences and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "subtraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "compliance in misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Lastly, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “coverage of abuse of social property.”
Among those who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have service to whitewash the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being conducted within the framework of several court instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: the Elysee has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has vilified the public in France, alerted to diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful gaze of American diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée has explained its strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice on how to manage their own “refugee” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by U.S. justice for smuggling materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee Councillor for Strategic Affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discrete channels are exhausted, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “experts in dilatory maneuvers.”
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss’ prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) “will require the Iranians to pay a large sum of money” (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he notes that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is stuck in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for the illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran’s clandestine networks of procurement of nuclear program material, Majid Khakavand’s release is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Liberating the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier guarantees that it was not so.
The Elysée, he says, not only “has been enormously surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the decision" judicial, he comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the “close” surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysee’s adviser marks a phone number, hangs up and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in a Paris building run by the Iranian embassy.”
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not squander in efforts, using media-organized communications and "escapes" to make it believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator."
Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
Why is such “thank you” to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their acclaimed statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done.”
Next, the document deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to give way to this fiction.
The major communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of openness towards Syria,” he said.
A policy started in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been spotted prematurely and unworthy".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris tries to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided: “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians have done anything or not.”
"But anyway, if we've thanked him."
“At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight, Korean young people can't play online
The South Korean government is to pass a law called “the Cinderella” that will prevent teens from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under 16, representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family have indicated.
“Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, ministerial head of the bill.
The online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of young people so request, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request free computer programs that allow to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints organising countries
In the midst of the storm sparked by suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday designates the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests in the game.
Transactions between backgrounds, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the fire on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the British officials, who have been thrown into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The Head of Government hopes to republish the successful coup given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had in 2005 achieved the organization of the JJ.O.O. 2012 for London.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain England's brilliance before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strong points thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the shady economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, turned into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidacy (stadions, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an “unfair competition in the preparation of the vote,” in a direct allusion to the accusations of the British press against members of the EC.
“They are pulling out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
As the world’s first economic powerhouse and home to the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: granting the 2026 World Cup to China, eagerly desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of opportunities by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be harmed by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: The Test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
The current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
Evidence of this, however, does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear to be doubtful.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometimes in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the MPs of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Elysée, the possibility of "two terms" has caused some turmoil.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
It’s not the first time she’s talking about presidential elections, with a funny tone, in meetings of this kind.
“In the worst, or better, of all cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me,” he said in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, "Don't think I don't think about what's coming next."
His earlier statements do not bring him any closer to the nomination, nor less.
There are comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race by the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal has gone up to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather, the fact that his 2012 candidacy is evident is what drives many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized sooner than expected.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he thinks he can lose, he won’t be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He will always think he can win,” corrects Alain Juppé, resigned from the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) this year should allow it to clarify the exit modalities of the crisis or at least announce the suspension of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that are expected to end at the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so perennial if it does not want to risk aggravating a more complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde supported the ECB’s active role in resolving the European states’ debt crisis.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example, by increasing its program of buying state bonds.
"I reserve my opinion for my European comrades."
On the eve of his hearing in Brussels before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the programme for the purchase of State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that we will see it "already".
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday it would have bought again Irish and Portuguese securities.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities for an amount of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt in the least that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations at beneficial conditions with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't think he's going to significantly change his program."
"If not, there would be a risk of further short-term tensions," said Michael Schubert, economist at the Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011,” says Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such bonds in order for the market to remain stable,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
“It must compensate at all costs for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in returns paid by the most fragile states,” a senior bond manager said.
Because, if interest rates are set by the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi’s government overrides the temporary
After Italy began the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
On the eve of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti calling the situation "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of the hedge contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had risen to 263 points, causing a certain turmoil in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "turbulence in markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnant income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to cope with its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions could be applied after the holidays, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate, short-term or long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are smaller than those required by other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Representatives, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a decision-making period in the event of a serious crisis would be opened.
Europeans are reflecting on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, night and day that Europeans are clearly in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday’s relaxation in the rates of European states’ obligations has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a standardization principle.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target at the moment of speculation.
“Like in May, there is really a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on the banking systems,” say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying debates to strengthen existing mechanisms for exiting the crisis.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its chief executive, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issue of FEEF securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path from the one followed by Greece and Ireland.
They both want to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they deem necessary to increase confidence in a sustainable way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds consider the options available to speed up the process of standardisation of public bond markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to rethink the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider an amount of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion additional would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, currently endowed with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A council that could, without a doubt, examine European capitals in detail.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosin.
The snows are strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, traffic in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend not to drive except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation in Picardie has been banned.
No specific measures had been envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture “inspires all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.”
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights at Paris Roissy airport and 10 percent in Orly due to the forecast snowfall on Thursday.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro du Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate over the modernization of transport on the Island of France has reached its peak, it has been raining billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
Theoretically, this amount will later allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a portion of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 Corrigendum Finance Act, considered by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices envisaged to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the office tax on the Island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The proceeds of this tax are 117 million euros per year."
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and to allocate such an increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
"It is necessary that the fiscal resources be added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we read in the exposition of reasons.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to the needs."
The SGP estimates that it will begin to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion pledged are not included in the credit, could spark a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avengers Hackers and Diligent Spy
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous to the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresaw a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their own.
The rule that secret files should only be formed by news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the non-existent), but because those dedicated to occultism not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same goes for secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, what I know, the editor of the Libération), who only considers what he can recognize certain.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. Embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as published in Newsweek the previous week.
Why, then, have the revelations of these records caused such a tumult?
On the one hand, they say only what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can call or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer who watches research films knows it perfectly, we just don’t seem to know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "verduggers".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
In Orwell's time, he could be conceived of as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, it is all power, which they are secret, since they come from the public sphere; but they are secret, as it has done, to reveal them to WikiLeak, as it has done.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much more to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like publishing it on a streetcartridge.
But it’s also clear that, with current technologies, you can’t expect to hold confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has moved on a plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the time being, my prediction is a science fiction thing and therefore novel, but I imagine governmental agents moving discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at least, hiding some written data behind their heels.
That information is then stored, in a single copy, in locked drawers with a key: in the end, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has once again created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video tapes (analogous) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow moving forward or backward from chapter to chapter, i.e. to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the departures it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly planned in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s blunders in its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the fast-unlocked funding promises made by developed countries have been fulfilled.
And the French chapuzas have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed to contribute <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France 1.260 million (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast-start finance is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The Transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what it was really worth: developing countries and civil society wanted all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meeting its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what “new and additional” means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, each one chooses the reference that best suits him.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added over three years in terms of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, it does not refer to the expenditures of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, France's total amount of aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there are no rules and each chooses the calculation method.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowed equals a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is false to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, it should be calculated for its commitments only the cost of the loan.
But France does not find this reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that makes such frequent use of the loan.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to stocks in time and on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, he gets the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States were going to continue to donate when they can just lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter on early funding is a short-term minuscule in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of sand left over in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the rest of the European Union.
But, especially, France could advance the debate on gambling in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the issue of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Environment Minister, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s quick start and its vision of the “additional character” and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the former movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results “do not have a significant statistical value considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with,” acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years old usually consumes on four meals and a snack.
These model meals, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as the treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The plate balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that can act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Center for Research on Carcinogens.
“Although in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumers’ exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic wastes and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty wastes that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan greens, included in food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were glued with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these “contaminant cocktails” for the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
