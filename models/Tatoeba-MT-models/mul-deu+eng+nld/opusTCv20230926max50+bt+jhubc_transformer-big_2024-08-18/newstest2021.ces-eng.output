Newcomer helped Trabzonspor to second place, also hit <0xC5><0xA0>koda
Defender Filip Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k helped the goalkeeper in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2–1 at Kayserispor and kept the third Besiktas behind him.
Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda scored the 10th goal for Rizespor after a transfer from Slavia in January, which was saved by a 1–3 loss on Fenerbahce.
Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k confirmed to the defender excellent productivity with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor only started a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from the corner blew the ball into the net.
The homers managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the setup shot the victory to his side when he successfully finished the four-to-one strike.
<0xC5><0xA0>koda in the first half of the match against Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e equalized after a solo 1:1.
Rizespor did not last for a long time, but he did not have to hate it, because thanks to the results of the rivals he remained three points above the descent range.
The competition will end Sunday’s duel with the champion Basaksehir at Kasimpasa.
A well-secret cave near a deserter in the forests near Nova Bora was actually uninhabitable
In the northern part of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ick<0xC3><0xBD> Mountains, near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipsko, in the forests that led the Hrab<0xC4><0x9B>c<0xC3><0xAD> cesta, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Naturally and artificially created.
And we're going to go behind that human hand.
The place is called the Cave of the Deserter.
In fact, no deserter ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a hidden chamber, apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rocky trench and accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, it is practically not seen until the last minute.
She reveals it through the narrow stairs leading to a sort of rock gallery, from where she is still entering the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human habitation, at the time of its formation it may have been on the upper platform, where today is a forest, field.
"The fact that the object does not have a window and even a traditional hot spring is a clear proof that no deserter could have survived the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek from the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelisti Purkyna in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone bench on the back, apparently used to dispose of containers.
“I see it as a storage chamber for some food or products from the field,” adds Kamil Podo<0xC5><0xBE>ek.
On the walls of the cave there are visible traces of tools.
Demolishing the sandstone with a spike was quite simple and fast for the dedicated.
It was enough to properly use the dampers and decompose the sandpaper gradually.
Depending on the length of the trail along the tip and even the method of cutting, it is possible to frame the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes someone sleeping there nowadays.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest trails and get caught under the cave by a flowing pathway and a nearby combing path, then you will certainly find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may even be caught by the nearby Havran<0xC3><0xAD> rock.
<0xC5><0xBD>okey Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philippe is in the best hands.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly facilitates the situation and also the care for Finj's daughter," the Jezdci.cz server quoted Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k's wife Katji as saying.
“Everyone is doing their best, Philip needs time to recover.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the woman of the forty-five-year-old.
Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh round of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, has also called for financial support for the injured Mina<0xC5><0x99>ek on Twitter, balancing the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been selected on the Gofundme server.
The target is 100,000 euros (2.6 million kroner).
Video referee took four goals to Sassuola footballers, losing 0:2
Sassuola's players got the ball four times in the opponent's goal in a Saturday game in Naples, but eventually had to make up for a 0:2 defeat.
None of their goals were conceded by the referee after consulting with the video due to the offense.
According to the Italian media, it is a record disadvantage of technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by a single team.
“The VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no team has ever done.
New technology breaks records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Festival of Sassuola's unknown goals.
He has never been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
However, Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>e's goal was not recognized after the video referee's intervention due to the offense.
For the same reason, Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>'s intervention and the hits of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi did not gradually apply.
On the other hand, the home team added another goal.
Electric cars are setting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were the most charged in history.
“The growth was accompanied by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations,” said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Chmel<0xC3><0xAD>k, Head of Clean Technologies Department at <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, the electric car maker Tesla, but also the supermarkets Bill and Lidl, have reported their share in the market.
The operator of classical pumping stations is represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
“We only started building our electric mobility network last year,” explained company spokeswoman Jana Juskov<0xC3><0xA1>.
However, the editorial board of the Journal exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by the company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
It turns out that drivers took off the stations on average 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the journey of about one hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we skip the small pumping to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling took place at a free rate.
If the motorists had already paid for the take-off, their typical spending was around 330 kroner.
E-mobility is mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s most expensive chargers, which are overshadowed by their popularity by the entire regional cities.
Among the regions is Olomouc.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border, such as Bohum<0xC3><0xAD>n or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey of the Czech daily "Czech in Motion", eight percent of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government’s steps so far on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more radical approach.
The Last Drop event was attended by representatives of major organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
“We have people here, for example, who have been standing up against the expansion of the Tur<0xC3><0xB3>w valley for a long time, there are people who have been standing up against the mining of gravel near the Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Ostro<0xC5><0xA1>, there are people who have been standing up against the construction of meaningless dams,” Marika Wolfov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
She said the main demands of the protesters were the creation of a plan to conserve water in the countryside, a rapid change in the agricultural policy and subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture, and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
“The government is to defend the interests of the people, not the ruthless and devastating business,” she said.
On Malostranské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> there was a booth with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to take action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of the hull of the hull" or "Less coal, more boats".
Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda from Za water for people came from southern Moravia to Prague, protesting against a plan to mine gravel in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
"It threatens a drinking water source for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned mining of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells and according to estimates it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
The so-called agroecological farmer came from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in Karlovarsk Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD>.
He pointed to the advantages of small farms, which do not marry for profit and profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, and above all they do not cause such destruction in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people have died in a plane crash at a house in Germany.
An ultra-light plane crashed into an apartment building in western Germany today, killing three people and injuring two others.
It was reported by local rescue teams, according to which there are probably two crew members and one resident of the house among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
The firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
The deputy commander of the local firefighters, Robert Meyboom, said the two crew members of the plane had apparently died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), referring to the mayor of Wesel, wrote that it was the mother of a self-employed woman whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
Near the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
Police say it's from a plane crashed.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, referring to eyewitnesses, said that before the crash, the aircraft crashed into a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the plane crashed in the air before it hit the ground.
The Czech Savings Bank mistakenly billed some payments with a card twice on Saturday.
Resolved the error
The Czech Savings Bank mistakenly charged some payments to its clients with a card twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to bank spokesman Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k, the problem may have affected thousands of transactions.
The bank has fixed the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with the doubled billing of card payments were noted by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
“Last night (Saturday) we did an update of the system and all these duplicate payments were immediately returned to the clients.
At the moment everything works without problems," Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice, the bank's spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, was lower in thousands of transactions.
The cause of the problem is determined by the economy.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Czech Savings Bank is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, there were 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch to present three anti-coronavirus emergency levels on Monday
"Steps will be based on the strength of community dissemination at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," said Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch in <0xC4><0x8C>T.
It is a so-called semaphore, the individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that the inclusion of individual regions will still be discussed with epidemiologists.
He admitted that at present only the Moravian-Silesian region would have the orange color and that Prague would approach it.
The map will also show individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.

The course of most diseases is mild, only 3% of those infected have to go to the hospital
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of the coronavirus, or the summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious departments of hospitals are semi-empty, although the numbers of infected are increasing.
"This situation today and in April is completely different and is mainly due to the number of hospitalized people," Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch confirmed.
It is worth recalling that on April 11, when the first wave of epidemics peaked in our country, they all wore costumes, the army made pickups, the republic was closed and the Czechs used disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people died a day, however.
Today, the daily increase in the number of people infected is higher, but a maximum of two people die each day with COVID-19.
The highest number of infected per capita still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to a fire in the local Alzheimer's Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors closed hygienic in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>ice on Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck.
The disease was confirmed by tests from one of the nurses.
"We're moving, we've limited movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says the director of the pensioner's home, Martin Sch<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B>l.
According to him, none of the clients at home has yet to have symptoms of the disease.
The hygienists will begin to carry out flat testing tomorrow and then decide on the next step.
Hospitals are also responding to an increased number of infections.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will see if people have a suit deployed at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemia hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of the coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the internship company.
A total of 131 people infected on Saturday – half of the number on Friday – are being tested less on the weekend.
Debuting champion!
Van den Bergh doping the fairy tale, Anderson's smettle
The great surprise of the tournament, named after Dimitri van den Bergh, also featured excellent performance in the match against a player who won the second most prestigious company in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was two-sided, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian arrowhead.
Van den Bergh took the bar with a 13-point leg and has had a top ever since.
His opponent literally smashed his game and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scot" was hard to get to the doubles.
The way the Dream Maker had it in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that the discarded Anderson played his first maximum until in the 24th league.
In addition, the young Belgian mastered excellent high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the 11th league, but in an unfavorable condition "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was very frustrated.
Rather, he threw the arrows, and his rival, walking behind the triumph, acted completely sovereignly.
Van den Bergh immediately changed the first of the three darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The earnings of the trophy named after Phil Taylor are all the more valuable for the Belgian arrowhead because it is his first major win.
The last player who managed to defeat van den Bergh is Karel Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, the accused for the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started burning last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original stained glass windows from the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Suspects of the fire were checked by investigators because the fire was proceeding through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police did not detect any signs that someone had entered the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor's office has informed that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.
If he is found guilty, he will face up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday we will present "semaphore" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to serve as a pandemic plan, due to which the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"They will gradually be according to the power of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that currently, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach the middle, orange level.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in the individual regions is significantly different, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be imposed on the individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear clothing or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
In order to create an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie television program, the Minister of the Interior Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) urged that people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented on this by saying that it is not essential to talk about the declaration of a state of emergency or the reconvening of a crisis staff.
In view of the increasing number of people infected since Saturday in the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events of over 100 people.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government’s process, when it was not clear until the last minute what measures would take effect and when they would not be announced, has come under criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security on the contrary and balance the confusion on the contrary," Senator Marek Hilser said.
The measures can now vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear masks also in non-residential medical facilities, for example in pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor’s office.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies was introduced from Friday also in the Liberec and <0xC3><0x9A>steck region.
In Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina in Jihlavska, it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, in MHD and in medical facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian region, anti-epidemic measures have been released, as well as in the Central Bohemian region of Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved a so-called traffic light for Europe, which colourfully differentiates the rate of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable for entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and middle-risk countries, authorities do not require Czech citizens to have a negative coronavirus test from 15 June or do not quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU member states are now in the low risk category of infection.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko continues.
Plays on a third capacity, had to end at noon
Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko) Technoparty at Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, there were 900 in the morning, said police spokeswoman Lucie Novakov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Originally, the technoparty was due to end on Sunday at noon, at which time some of the music systems really shut down.
“Some have already left and others are about to leave.
The music production is still going on.
We expect to gradually disconnect and disassemble the music systems," Novakov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
“Policemen are still consistently monitoring outgoing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of police officers are supervised by the regular police unit, foreign police, transport and regular police are on the scene, and there are also dog convoys with service dogs in the emergency room.
"During the day, police checked 470 people moving at the scene of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath tests, six of them sitting behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novakov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for drug and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police have also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technoparty participants, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of intoxicating and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not decreased, the police would have intervened.
On Prime Party television, Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said this.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, and neither the sanitation station nor the Ministry of Health asked for it.
Czech Television (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that the technoparty was extended to the surrounding lands, the owners of which did not agree to use for technopartys.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding lands will demand compensation.
Fans of the techna at Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota arrived on Friday night.
Police were initially guarding the lawn in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im, Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk, where technopartys were held last year.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota, where the technicians finally sat down.
According to Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, no one came to Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im.
Snake Clamping: The Girl Ends in the Hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in <0xC5><0xBD>eleznorudsk.
Snakes in the feet of a girl, the year 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the emergency services base there," the regional spokeswoman of the health rescue service M<0xC3><0xA1>ria Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1> told the newspaper, with the child being taken to the hospital in Klatovech.
Snakes are the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in <0xC5><0xA0>umava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that a snake will snatch you is not too high, with regular contact they are afraid of themselves.
And if he has room for it, he likes to fly away for a loud sneeze.
It only attacks if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally kick it.
Neither is it a tragedy, its poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will not die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk is especially for children, seniors and allergies.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting after constipation, sweating, has an increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," she explained.
The man threatened to throw the babies out of the window.
After the policeman lil wine and throw dishes
After 11 p.m., an interception unit entered the apartment and arrested the man.
The children were immediately taken into care by medical professionals, regional police spokesperson Markéta Janovsk<0xC3><0xA1> said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw dishes, knives or soaked it out of the window with wine.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
One day he even climbed up to the window sill, where he came back.
The police are still investigating the man.
No further information is yet to be published.
Stosurov<0xC3><0xA1> prefers her daughter before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will no longer be in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
Sixty-six-year-old champion US Open 2011, who became a mother in June, but still does not want to end her career.
He plans to return to the courtyards next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
“I’ll stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little miles that our Evie will live through in the next six months, and I’ll just enjoy it,” she said in a statement.
The WTA Tour will resume the suspended season from March 3 to August 3 with the Antuco Tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Marketplace: Razie Reveals Meat, Fish and Eggs of Unknown Origin
"One of the vehicles entering the site transported 1,320 pieces of cartilage eggs of unknown origin, in addition to in inappropriate conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of in an assay facility," said the State Veterinary Administration.
During the inspection of the live fish stand, it was found that the seller does not have proof of origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
Last fall, for example, veterinarians discovered an illegal food sale, with almost half a tonne of unmarked food without proof of origin.
For most, the date of consumption could not be ascertained, some of the products had a past shelf life and were damaged.
For five kilograms of sepsis, the expiry date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police arrested 80 kilograms of food on the market without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is expected to take effect from midnight.
According to the Kremlin’s statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday night, Ukraine and Russia agreed to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in a new ceasefire.
The ceasefire is scheduled to begin after midnight on Monday, to be "complete and general" and to pave the way for compliance with other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky that the decision by the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine’s parliament last week decided that the upcoming elections to local representatives would not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after granting broad autonomy to these regions and organising local elections there.
The Green Office said the two states agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in the Donbass and on the need to take further measures to support peace in the region, such as the demolition of combat areas or the withdrawal of part of troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied Crimean peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Accord helped to stop the fighting, but in occasional shootings and artillery attacks on both sides of the front, people continue to die.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed more than 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support from the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbass his priority, but a major breakthrough in the negotiations has not yet occurred.
The unexpected champion in the decimal box is Rykl, the seventh-boj controlled by Novotn<0xC3><0xA1>
Defender of the last two titles Dol<0xC5><0xBE>al did not reach the conclusion of Saturday's program of the quarterfinals, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> did not jump the base in the bar on Sunday.
Detetiboji was ruled for a long time by the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the Josef Karas group, but resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor M<0xC4><0x8C>R so far, this time he was the only ten-year-old to get over the seven thousand mark.
Other medals were won by Vilém Str<0xC3><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urb<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
Rykl after the competition recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> S<0xC3><0xBD>kora.
"It's a shame there weren't any boys here and Kope didn't start, because that would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put the persona 30 centimeters away.
Then I was even more pleased with the stick and the most disappointed about the disk, I was there under-average," he admitted on federated Facebook.
On the first day of the seven-day race, Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cach won by more than a hundred points, despite suffering from an ankle injury on the reflective leg.
However, in the telemedicine sector, she only recorded 570 cm, did not exceed 40 meters with a split and did not reach the final eighth.
Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> scored 5878 points and won by 241 points against Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She was especially distant, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was around the 630s.
“Yesterday I started to pull a dice, but I was so glad that I didn’t feel it at all and that it didn’t limit me at all,” Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> said on her Facebook page.
Bio LPG arrives in Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or petrol, given the significantly lower consumption tax, but its benefit is also in the lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like petrol and petrol, it also has its eco-friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, this is entirely new - the proposal first appeared on the European market and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping stations in a mixture with classical fossil LPG," said the association of J. Karl<0xC3><0xAD>k from Primagas.
Bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the conventional LPG, which many motorists are now refuelling in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions at will.
"The only difference from classical LPG is the way it is produced," says Ivan Indra<0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the major advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and also the distribution infrastructure is quite good, for example, compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
On the other hand, conventional oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the technology of production and the source of the operation of the bio LPG car, it is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation of petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to petroleum.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from car exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, the so-called "well-to-tank" part (from source to tank).
One of the largest producers of bio LPG currently includes petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170,000 vehicles are driving on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment lists in the NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M a slightly higher number, about 200,000.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered cars were converted last year.
Tanking LPG is possible in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of different operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch revised the number of infected, the number of cases dropped by 1775
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from 5,254 to 3,479 cases, which is 1,775 fewer.
Currently, there are 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump increase in the number of patients treated is the revision of the data, which the hygienists have not tried to update lately," said Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, Head of Health Statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people were infected in the Czech Republic, 11,419 were cured and 371 Covid-19 diseases were unfortunately succumbed to.
A mobile constituency or a correspondence choice.
Political scientists and sociologists are looking for alternatives to the pandemic.
In order for people in the quarantine to vote in the October regional and Senate elections due to the coronavirus, the law needs to be changed, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He made it to the Prime Minister's Party on Sunday.
On Tuesday, the ministry wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the current legal rules.
However, the minister said that it will be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health condition.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather be uploaded to other types of parties) from the correspondence elections to be overrated.
Personally, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma said that now it is necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
The main one is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The correspondence option (whether in the Czech Republic or abroad) is considered one of the functional methods.
As others see the already mentioned constituencies or perhaps the possibility of representative voting within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations – elections at the time of the coronavirus – were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections have already been postponed this year in 67 countries around the world.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears thrown by demonstrators at government building
Participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojk Borisov and his cabinet put pig ears on the government building.
It was another of a series of protests against the “Mafia style of rule” that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA agency said.
Today’s protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, had a weaker participation than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/R<0xC3><0xA1>dio Svoboda.
Around 20:00, about 300 people gathered, some streets had to be closed for transport.
Demonstrators in front of the government building played a theater scene in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Geshev into the prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignation of the two is one of the main demands of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Organizer of the protests Nikolai Hadzigenov said in a public broadcast that on Wednesday there is a "top of escalation" in the form of "a national demonstration in Sofia and a blockade across the country".
He reiterated his call for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as for early elections to be held.
These are expected to take place in March 2021.
Borisov said earlier that he did not intend to resign.
This was justified, inter alia, by the need to implement the Covid-19 pandemic in Bulgaria and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, although the resignation of the protesters did not calm down.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government stopped voting on confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants games without spectators
Football coach Sini<0xC5><0xA1>a Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> has already had enough matches in the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we’re doing right now is not football.
I've got my teeth full of games without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so," Mihajlovic said before today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, Serie A matches are followed in quick succession, and although they are played until the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible heat.
Under such circumstances, we don’t even know how the teams are.
I hope this season is over.
The measures had to be taken in order for the competition to go up, but I hope that from September the fans will be back," said the coach, who in the past also led Fiorentina or AC Milan.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he was missing four months on the bench due to treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, my league breaks and everything else, our team has managed to move the level up.
We want to continue to grow and to do this we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of a cyberattack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses have reported fires and explosions.
Some Iranian officials said the fire, which broke out in Natanz’s underground nuclear operation this month, could have caused cyber-sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
A spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry, Abbas Musavi, told reporters that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure is facing “thousands of cyberattacks” every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to resist.
In the past few months, according to Musavi, there have been several broader cyberattacks, which according to the analysis were "certain governments and groups".
More details about possible perpetrators, however, he did not say, according to Reuters.
Mus<0xC3><0xA1>v<0xC3><0xAD> also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by the Iranian state agency IRNA this month discussed that enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the United States, may have been behind recent incidents.
However, none of these countries have been directly charged with the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tense relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Kasem Soleimani and a member of the Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran set fire to bases in Iraq, where the Americans are operating, with a large number of missiles.
The U.S. has since admitted that dozens of U.S. troops have been wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Automobile TPCA has extended the production pause, now until May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended its production pause due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are scheduled to restart on Monday morning, May 25.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said automotive spokesman Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek.
Production has been stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
The company originally planned to renovate it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubka, the reason for the extension of the break is closed borders and closed dealerships, so no one has to sell cars.
According to Paroubk, the company will produce at 100 percent from the start, i.e. on two shifts.
Coronavirus affects key markets of the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Change for Cologne) said that the stoppage of production in TPCA is not signed on life in the city.
“In the beginning, we knew it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now that Monday, when it has been much relaxed.
So the city is full," Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed at the shelters.
"In those two months we didn't have to solve almost any problem," Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par said.
For example, the young Boleslav <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto, which also interrupted production due to the coronavirus crisis, renewed it on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production facilities in the Czech Republic.
None of the races work at 100 percent capacity.
The restoration of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
In the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and Kvasin<0xC3><0xA1> for the first time after the restoration of production.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer Kills Bride Shortly After Wedding: She Leaves Message to Family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson had been battling cancer, and when it seemed that she had defeated the cancer, the disease came back.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in bed in a hospice, where she still had to marry her life’s love.
Unfortunately, the disease was subjugated.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, a native of Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her friend Ricky Moore, who has lived with her for over 16 years, they traveled around the world.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman was sporting and living well, but was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhaustive treatment, radiation therapy, in hopes of recovering.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to have managed to overcome cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time, the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the British daily Daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery and then began a drastic treatment again.
Of course, everything was useless.
At the beginning of this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, her doctors announced that she had a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde finally decided to enter a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every moment, who even arranged a wedding to her lover Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemmu back to the restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post appeared on her social media account that Gema wrote for her family.
“If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough, who was by my side all along and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media, saying that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she found peace.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all my followers on social media,” she wrote, “Everyone should respect their life and live it to the fullest.”
Art machines sell sweaty date, amulet from mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred kroner, a passing pocket piece will be obtained mostly by Czech artists starting out.
The images and other creations are created directly for the artmat, in advance they know that they must fit in size 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said project curator Petra Wi<0xC5><0xBE>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Artmat works with the principle of randomness.
In this way, the buyer can be surprised by what kind of artwork he acquires.
Currently, you can become a new owner of Alexandra <0xC5><0xA0>toplov<0xC3><0xA1>’s fantastic illustrations or mini-views from Tereza Bonaventur, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in collaboration with Dora Dutkova, has prepared a pekesos associated with the Prague walk.
Cards need to be paired with household signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrov<0xC3><0xA1> and Juli<0xC3><0xA1>na Chomov<0xC3><0xA1> sell the pocket packaging of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the wedding and a witch card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic Spiritista.
Salaries in healthcare will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
The increase is unrealistic according to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch
Salaries in healthcare could rise by as much as five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) said in Questions by V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Moravce on Czech Television.
The unions’ demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protection aid.
The hospitals, he says, now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (payments) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect on the current situation, when since March it has intervened in the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and government regulations against its spread.
Income from insurance companies declined at the time.
"I think an increase of 15 percent is unrealistic at the moment," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
The average monthly salary of a doctor in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach this year 88,312 kroner, nurses 47,498 kroner.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The <0xC3><0x9A>ZIS data also shows that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Representatives of trade unions said in June that they would require a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally of 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the salaries of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be governed by payrolls, and contract salaries in hospitals in cities, provinces, or private.
They therefore also require that the payrolls for health care providers be uniform.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to 7,000 crowns per month.
For example, last year’s salaries grew faster than the salaries.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber Roman <0xC5><0xA0>muclera, trade unionists should understand how it is at present.
The House has recently approved an increase in this year’s state budget deficit to a record 500 billion kroner, of which 1.75 billion is expected to go to hospital and social services health workers’ salaries.
According to <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, the Board of Health Providers does not agree with a flat salary increase next year.
According to him, the hospitals themselves and the medical facilities themselves should decide on the remuneration, and the money in addition to them should go through the remuneration statement.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr, Chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently own a single protective medical device.
He is waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were purchased.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The soldiers could take over the sleek quarantine.
We are ready, they say.
“The smart quarantine works, it’s something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not run it all over again," the prime minister said Sunday on his Facebook page, "Chou People."
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and sanitary stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian-Silesian region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he has no information on Sunday’s talks and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The Smart Quarantine Project was adopted by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
By then, a clever quarantine was led by a 90-member central command team established under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The project was criticised by Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Sunday.
He also said that he could be recaptured by the army.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Dzurilla, who is in charge of IT and digitalization, also acknowledged the shortcomings in the project.
“The system works, but it’s still working.
Twenty years it was created independently and systemically, now we are trying to unite it within a few months.
It's not a rush.
People on the march, the poor on the hygiene on the march adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "fool in politics"
The current Ostrava Mayor Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is an effort to "don't get lost in politics," he told the Respect.cz server.
Macura, who is also a member of the chairmanship of the ANO movement, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava, led by him, won almost a third of the vote.
The Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I could stand one term and with that business experience, I could turn everything around and put it on my feet during that time," he said.
He added that he allowed himself to be persuaded to some extent during the second term.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don’t want to fool you in that politics,” Macura added, who in an interview called himself a heavy introvert who is not fit for frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for a long time about Macro’s possible end in the YES movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the YES movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD or for supporting Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few ANO personalities, he supported Zeman’s opposition candidate Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Drahos in the elections.
From the YES movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura is not planning to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight and that no one is bothering me, I don't have an immediate motive to end it," he said.
The sixty-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark, among other things.
He has also served in the organs of other companies.
Uber to return to Brno offering transport services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
It is a consequence of a change in the law, said in a press release on Thursday the city council for transport Petr Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l (ODS).
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as labelling as a taxi or taxi meter.
Since July, however, the conditions for operating regular taxis and alternative taxis have changed.
In the past few weeks, he has held several talks with representatives of Uber.
"On their basis, this company decided at the end of July this year to return with its services to Brno.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to legally operate its business.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as a taxi or missing taxi meter.
The court issued a preliminary ruling banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno was originally supported by taxi drivers last year, but Mayor Markéta Vanekova (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court rulings, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return on the basis of a change of law.
In addition to classic taxis with a light and a taxameter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications.
Too crowded party in Brno: flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
From the fourth floor of the apartment, an office chair flew out in Brno on Saturday evening and fell about a meter from the hallway.
He was followed by a walker, who immediately called the guards.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the guard noticed an open window, under which the chair was still lying, and next to it several cans and cans.
"The smoke, which was carried from the room on the fourth floor, suggested that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The guards went out the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men between the ages of twenty-six and twenty-nine to explain," said security spokesman Jakub Ghanem.
The request for appeal of Rafaje raises Babi<0xC5><0xA1> with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans on Monday to discuss with coalition social democrats a request for a motion to dismiss the head of the antitrust office (MOA) Petr Rafaje.
To appeal Rafaje, non-profit organizations called for the anti-corruption council of the government and also the <0xC3><0x9A>stec region.
The Social Democrats say that the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>TK Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term expires in the middle of next year, and he cannot be appointed a third time under the law.
His appeal is under the jurisdiction of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the invitation of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>stec region.
The reason is, among other things, Rafael's recent causes.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request by saying that the materials would be made known and that the government parties would take "some opinion" on the matter.
He also said he had not yet negotiated the challenge with the president and had no meeting with him in the near future.
According to the OHCHR, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Last week, the servers IHNED.cz and Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz wrote that the police were interested in Rafaj’s meetings with Heytman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
The meetings put into context, among other things, the decision to compete for the project of the controversial new Zlin hospital for eight billion, which <0xC3><0x87><0xC3><0xBA>nek strongly advocates.
The hearing of the meeting admitted that, according to him, they dealt with his "senate activities" together.
The same goes for Rafael.
The representative of the <0xC3><0x9A>stek region called on the government to appeal Rafael at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The decision of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS on public contracts according to Deputy Heitman for transport Jaroslav Kom<0xC3><0xAD>nka is not transparent and has signs of willpower.
Last March, police raided the antitrust office over a bid to select a myth.
This year, in June, the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz warned that Rafaj is using the apartments written on the company of the influential backstory player <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Alexandra <0xC4><0x8C>uby.
A deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno, however, was paid from Rafay's account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Competition is Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office the President of the former Member of Social Democracy was appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafayev's second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the president may dismiss the president of the office on a proposal from the government.
It may be revoked only if it does not serve for more than six months, or seriously impairs the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blankenes library, employees were hotly collapsing.
It will help with air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blanska regularly.
In the warmer months, it was hardly there.
There was a terrible heat and bad air.
The wind didn't help.
That's why I love air conditioning," said one of the readers of the Blankenes, Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Dlapa library, temperatures in the building often rose to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
In addition, the sun relies on it due to the curvature of the building for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate the individual compartments, because during the night the windows must be closed for safety reasons.
We often have that from the morning in the library to thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And the floor above then the showroom and the director.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
“It has happened several times that librarians at work collapsed and ended up in incapacity for work.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes there was no breath," Dlapa noted.
Originally, the city’s representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all the premises of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three out of five circles.
“Because of the limited funding, the air conditioning will have only the most problematic areas.
A study room and a reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department are upstairs," informed Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Svoboda from the investment department in Blana.
He added that in the first phase, workers already installed air conditioning in the aforementioned premises last autumn and modified the electrical installation.
Approximately 360,000 kroner.
The Blansko City Library has nearly 3,000 registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
Chicago's resistance has driven the coronavirus out.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, who are silent about the health of the players as a grave and do not publish anything at all.
As one of the few, he stepped out of the Crawford series.
The thirty-five-year-old Montréal native was only present at the first training session, and has been missing since then.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and that is why I have spent the last fourteen days locked up in my house," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goalkeeper is the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks are waiting for a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the forecourt.
Thousands protest in Israel against Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deals with the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on a regular basis for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation because of a process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is dealing with another wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's generally known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his dress," stood another.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried in office.
He is charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and mistrust.
All charges are dismissed and labeled as a witch hunt.
According to local media, the process can take up to three years, more than 300 witnesses have been summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in Israel, which has a population of about nine million, has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people.
A total of 455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced a quarantine measure to help reduce the daily increase of the infected.
However, after the gradual release of restrictions at the end of April, the number of infected people began to grow again, particularly at the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics say that the government did not sufficiently assist, for example, businessmen affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters are also bothered by the fact that the government is issuing contradictory directions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out by firefighters.
The tragic accident occurred around 23:00 at Neveklov in a narrow district leading from the Slapsk<0xC3><0xA1> dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at a steady speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The firefighters had to remove the body from the wreckage, inter alia, cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are checked by police.
They ordered a court drink, which should explain, among other things, whether the man did not drive under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
End of wasting and squirming one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi Cancels Discounts and Bets on Sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and makes a fundamental change in its strategy.
He cancels the discounts and no longer wants to crawl one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of clothing end up in combustion plants and landfills every year.
The view of slow fashion, often despised approach to clothing, has changed quite quickly over the past few years.
About half of Pietro Filipi’s goods were sold at full price.
The second half, which was sold thanks to discounts, simply does not buy.
The company does not want to crawl one collection after another and at the end of each season to discount the products below their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the era of new and old collections and blind follow-up of rapidly changing fashion trends is gone.
“Most discount traders already count when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it’s actually a bit of a scam,” says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
In addition, the company wants to support local businesses with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is overtime and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the premium brands segment is typical of the absence of any discount, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is therefore not necessary," adds Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Giant graffiti presents RAF flight Kurt Taussig
"The mission was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The design liked the city's management," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-<0xC5><0xA0>anov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where they held him for several weeks.
He and his brother, however, managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then undertook pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times as well as his native Teplice, which granted him an honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, known by people in the street graphic art industry as Camo, has been working with spray in thermal streets for over 20 years.
He began with graffiti on the surfaces that the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) designated for these purposes.
Hurricane Hanna Arrives on the Coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST for today).
He struck the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and as he moved above the mainland, he fell into a tropical storm.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it a strong wind and heavy rain; along with local floods, the AP reported power failures and various material damages, including damaged ships.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Saturday declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was received by people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total it has been forced to hit the nearly 500-kilometre-long territory before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising levels, a dangerous precipice and a unique tornado can pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a statement.
This morning local time (afternoon SEL<0xC4><0x8C>) the storm was moving in the U.S.-Mexico border area and was accompanied by wind speeds of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year’s hurricane season in the Atlantic.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by wind speeds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but as it progressed to the mainland, it gradually dropped to 112 kilometers per hour, disqualifying Hannah from the hurricane category again.
Local authorities have called for storms to cross over at home, while not forgetting the hygienic measures associated with the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the states most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to respect the gaps, possible evacuations are also a major challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter after evacuated, who had tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to infections.
The local authorities have called on all those evacuated to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter, if possible.
"We don't have it far behind us yet.
We are expecting catastrophic flooding,” said Chris Birchfield, an AP agency working for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Predictions say that in some places, it could rain as much as 300 millimetres in a few hours, in some cases as little as 500 millimetres, which, along with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman Borrows General Staff to Colonel Lipk
On Wednesday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman will lend the rank of General to Colonel Pavlo Lipkov.
This is based on an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for borrowing the rank of brigadier general is the August accession of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the alliance’s multinational division northeast of Poland.
Lipka still serves as the deputy commander of the Czech Army’s ground forces.
The promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl <0xC5><0x98>ehku as deputy commander of the multinational division north-east in Poland’s Elblag, which commands the Allied presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltics.
<0xC5><0x98>ehka became director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (N<0xC3><0x9A>KIB) in March.
The government has proposed to the president to lend Lipk the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Law on Soldiers of Occupation, a higher rank may be loaned to a soldier for the duration of the elected function or for the duration of a service assignment that requires a higher rank to be loaned.
The position of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general rank.
A soldier to whom the rank has been lent has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that corresponds to that value.
The borrowing of the value lasts until the reason for which it was granted is omitted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for the subordinates.
In a significant way, it participates in the execution of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and securing the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defense said in June of the proposal for promotion.
The Wednesday promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. at the Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Metnar or Chief of Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Opata.
EU Countries Have Coronavirus Standards for Aviation
EU countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the compliance with the distance or the wearing of suitcases in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported to Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The measures agreed include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to observe the recommended distance during safety checks and check-in at the airport.
A sufficient amount of fresh air must be ensured in aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy mid-seater seats.
The common rules agreed upon by the officials shall comply with at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
In fact, different standards caused confusion.
In the Arctic Spitsbergen, the temperature record fell, measured there almost 22 degrees
“A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen,” the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the afternoon, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, 0.4 degrees above the 1979 record, he added.
Longyearbyen is the largest city in <0xC5><0xA0>picberk, located about 1,300 kilometers from the north pole.
The spikes are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the danger of warming other parts of the Arctic – from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies last year.
According to him, the average temperature in <0xC5><0xA0>picberk<0xC3><0xA1> increased by three to five degrees from the 1970s.
By the year 2100, it could rise by as much as 10 degrees, if it does not reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
The increase in temperature in <0xC5><0xA0>picberk<0xC3><0xA1> can result in the melting of permanently frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause even more avalanches and sediments of soil.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or tuna, which are dependent on the ice cover of the ocean.
The British returning from Spain are awaiting a mandatory two-week quarantine.
The British Cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all trips to mainland Spain that are not necessary due to the risk of the spread of COVID-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the British diplomat said in a statement.
“We have always made it clear that if we need to, we will remove a certain country immediately from the list of safe people,” she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.
The British are concerned, among other things, whether they will be paid sickly if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, they were scheduled to leave on Tuesday.
Arrivals have been ordered since December.
“We should have gone to the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don’t know what will happen.
“I work as an engineer and I don’t think my employer will agree that I will be in quarantine for two weeks after I return from vacation,” Hunter said.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new infections in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife and thus prevent people from meeting in large gatherings.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Dukovan Electricity Purchase Model Discussed by Government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill counts on the fact that if the ransom price is higher than the price of power in the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the redemption price will be lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek (for ANO) and the energy company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ said earlier that the more likely option is that people will save electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as has been shown several times in the past.
The plan has previously been criticised by environmental organizations.
“The retail price can be both below and above the market price of power.
The final impact at the time of the rule’s applicability can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the fuse - with a lower consumption or according to the consumption of electricity - with a higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MPO) said in the documents to the material.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people at the Dukovan building will make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact will be in tens of crowns per year per family, which he says is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported resources.
He previously estimated that the redemption price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal of the amount, it shall be included only in the redemption contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, at which traders are now supplying the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With the difference in the redemption price and the market price of power electricity in the amount of ten euros, the average household with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could make a supplement - it can correspond to the four-member households, which are not normally equipped with electric appliances - in the case of electric appliances in the case of electric appliances, not in the case of electric stoves, but in the case of electric stoves.
“We are living in a very turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a very speculative issue," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Voltr, CEO of the Energy financial group.
The proposed law envisages that the redemption would be carried out by the MPO and the legal entity entrusted by it owned by the state at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, even if repeated, but not longer, until the operation of low-carbon production is terminated.
A low-carbon production design is defined as the production of electricity with a nuclear reactor connected to an electrification system with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek said earlier that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to be put into operation in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed non-annually by the state during construction, with an interest rate of two per cent for operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it also has a problem with the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state is expected to contribute 70 percent to the construction.
The rest should be paid by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will also pay any additional costs.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ Director General Daniel Benes said in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (about 162 billion kroner).
Agreements between the state and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded material to support tourism in the media for two billion
According to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising for a holiday in the Czech Republic, the office withdrew from the recall procedure.
Minister Kl<0xC3><0xA1>ra Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> (for ANO) of the server SeznamZr<0xC3><0xA1>vy.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) was notified on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The ministry justified the plan for the collapse of tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a decline in revenues.
The proposal sparked criticism from the opposition and representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now available for viewing on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give through the state agency for tourism promotion CzechTourism money for advertising in television, radio, press, internet, billboards or stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million kroner, would get the television.
Most of them are private TVs Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weekly newspapers would get $400 million, and the same share would give the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners, and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which were private stations again.
The remaining $150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at stations or in the subway.
The campaign to support tourism in the Czech Republic was scheduled to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> said without further details on the server.
The material was criticised by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarova Adama, the media would benefit from advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babis (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this blatant contempt will get a blow between the eyes in the autumn elections," she wrote on Twitter.
Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l rejects that it is in fact aid to the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she told the N-Day on Friday.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course, we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
The Save Tourism Initiative does not make sense a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in the tourism industry, not a unnecessary advertising campaign," said the president of the initiative Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k on Sunday.
If those two billion kroner are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, writes the initiative in an open letter to the government.
A splash of life, a bucket of beer, and death like a stalk of grass
The third album A mort is a stub of grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>a, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov’s discography it is the fifth item and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov’s poetry, which is itself an excellent interpreter.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, the year 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passed on through his own personal experiences and also very internal expressions of faith.
He was, of course, away from any agitation, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
In this context, Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ki), the masters are prominent.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s album offers recordings of author reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Kl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, or Honza Barton and V<0xC3><0xAD>t<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holat.
I would like to help myself with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>’s long poetry compositions.
"The pride and unending bitterness of them," writes Khrushchev, "over the state of our world endangered by destruction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into obscure consumer vanity and communalism, is increasingly moving away from what his soul was made of – from the mystery of faith, humility, and human closeness.
There was in them the narrowness of one who knew that the values for which he was created were of little interest, but who also knew that they could not be discarded only because of the general lack of interest.
Those poems reminded me that one might have to lose everything expensive, but it doesn’t matter how one loses it.
If he sells himself to the general collapse, he will give up skeptically, be frightened, or remain silent until the last moment in a calm and proud persistence in what he believes and what he loves.
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek
Former <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Prime Minister and Chairman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek is not a paid social democracy adviser.
The party president and interior minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said this today on the Prima Partie television show.
On Friday, the server SeznamZr<0xC3><0xA1>vy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s advisor.
"From time to time we will write an essay, he will occasionally send me some material and I will read it," Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said today.
He added that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"That I read his opinion from time to time, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS member Jan<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC4><0x8C>ernochov<0xC3><0xA1> Minister, he said that many ODS members are still "incredibly listening to the views of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus".
This is okay, he said, because he is an experienced politician and a former chairman of the party, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that the media are making an affair with it, he marked as a sign of this year’s cucumber season.
On Friday, the server SeznamZr<0xC3><0xA1>vy.cz wrote that Paroubek was acting as Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the party’s fourth-place candidate in the Mousek region is the former chairman of the cell there, Petr Bend, who is associated with Paroubke and served as vice-chairman of his LEV 21 party.
Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said today that the composition of the candidate will not be commented until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead, it's a kick in the ass, it's a swedish challenger
The 22-year-old American bartender has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat two years younger Duplantis, beat him last year at a meeting of the NCAA Universities Association.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won and I was second, then we went through it.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," Nilsen said, who secured the victory with a 5.95-metre performance.
But Duplantis has since fired upwards and is currently alone in the highest ribbon spheres.
In just twenty years, he became the world record holder, this year on February 8 in Torun he surpassed the 6.17-metre latch, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimetre.
"He jumped six meters already at the age of 18 when he graduated from high school," Nilsen told the World Athletics website.
“It was clear that as soon as he grew from a boy to a man, all his potential and talent would be tenfold.
“Twenty years is a pretty good age to break the world record,” he said.
Although Nilsen’s success list is thinner in knowledge than the one that Duplantis prides himself on, the American has similar goals.
He pointed out his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, in February this year he improved his internal personal record at 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he competed for 13 scorpions and in the Americas.
The closest milestone for him then is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
“It’s definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because you can make a name there,” he said.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead as well at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and other tycoons time to improve.
But will it be enough to push Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five circles into a mere fight for silver?
"Everyone is trying to reach him, but I don't think it will be possible anytime soon," Nilsen said.
"The boy has been jumping for 16 years and in training he's got a mile ahead of everyone else."
And before Tokyo starts in 2021, he will want to increase it even more.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands on the disability pension of an incapacitated son.
The court awaits her.
The money a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman is threatened with up to eight years in prison.
Because of his ill health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and established his mother as a caregiver, who was to manage, among other things, his son’s money.
“From mid-November 2013 to January this year, a woman used part of her son’s disability pension funds for her needs and prepared him for 440 thousand crowns,” police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said in a statement after the accused’s arrest.
According to the court’s instructions, the woman set up an account for her son, but allowed his pension to be sent to her account.
"After paying for the costs associated with the stay of the son in the medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy vehicles, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment said.
That he can't use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
However, she defended herself by helping them with the payment of family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes to tighten the way of the household.
We've never bought anything above standard.
It was always about things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime,” the woman explained to police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuita cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools from limestone, including delicate blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as chips or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the instruments originated between 33,000 and 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they're here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite Cave, located at high altitude, has been inhabited for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely accepted theory has suggested that the first Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spikes used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture has subsequently spread to much of North America.
This model, however, suffered cracks in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, deals with 42 different locations across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them were able to get to America by boat.
"It's clear that humans were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said Ruth Gruhnov<0xC3><0xA1>, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Canada.
The interest in the tickets so far is filled with an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Gradually, prices are also decreasing.
Airline sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
The interest rate is still about half as compared to last summer, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
The post-crisis development thus according to sellers fills the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of tickets are also gradually decreasing.
Among the most sought after destinations according to the sellers are in particular the southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading.
At the portal Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz flights to Croatia are sold the most.
From other countries, the most sought after is the UK, which, of course, was one of the most difficult destinations ever.
The average price of airfares is also decreasing.
At the portal Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz, around 6250 kroner moved in about half of the month, year-on-year by 3000 kroner less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now accounts for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices in some European countries, such as Spain or Italy, have also fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets much less early than before, as they fear further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the time to buy a flight before departure has been reduced by about ten days a year.
“This will confirm the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, require more flexibility, take less risk,” said Michal <0xC5><0xA0>indel<0xC3><0xA1>r, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
The average flight time to book is currently 21 days before departure.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
At Prague Airport, there are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer, it is about half of the destinations.
The big finals tonight!
Watch the arrow battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has reached the grand final.
It features the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish archer Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, sixty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pipa in the first round, then hit his neighbor in the charts.
However, he also consulted with James Wad, and in the quarter-finals he vehemently opposed Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"Flying Scots" had suddenly in the semi-finals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the graveyard from the shoulder, dominated in prolongation, and after 18:16 he took a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated already in 2018, when he defeated Mensura Suljovi<0xC4><0x87> 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and perhaps the realization that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The twenty-six-year-old arrowhead first surprisingly knocked out the world sixth by Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they pushed over Jo Cullen and in the quarterfinals after a sharp start Adrian Lewis.
The finale was a big one.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the start, but in the quiet play the Belgian then gained an excellent series, which he then held more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he encountered occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has demonstrably infected 15,212 people.
Nearly 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, there are 5,254 patients.
This is according to the data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times two hundred in a row.
There were 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
From Covid-19, 9,590 people have been cured in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days in the per 100,000 population, Karvinsko still exhibits, almost 59.
It is followed by Jihlava district with 56 and Frydecko-M<0xC3><0xAD>stecko district with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in place in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear costumes at indoor mass events of over 100 people, it is a cultural and sporting event, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited by half from the current thousand people.
In the world, the number of people who have demonstrably infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded the limit of 16 million.
Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally, said.
The balance of victims who died from COVID-19 is close to 645,000, according to this source.
The latest million people infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on July 22.
The largest share of the rapid increase in the number of cases in recent days was the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where according to the authorities almost 1.4 million people were infected.
Infected people are now growing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases have been reported worldwide since Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the peak in populous states such as the US, Brazil or India, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies for example to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The disease has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case has officially announced today the DPRK.
The air in the home is up to five times worse than the outdoors.
Health Damage to Air Fresheners and Deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in the outdoors, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the creation of Israel’s Ministry of the Environment, it is necessary to focus on household pests right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
According to a study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the air quality in the home is up to five times lower than that in the outdoors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Due to the coronavirus epidemic that has forced many and is still forcing people to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it's time to focus on air quality in homes," she said.
In Israel, she says, the quality of “home air” is hardly anyone’s concern.
Dangerous can be things with which a person usually comes into contact - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
“Poisonous gas is also emitted by clothes that we wear regularly to the cleaner,” said Abrahamov<0xC3><0xA1>.
According to her, children, elderly household members and people with breathing difficulties are the most at risk.
Even otherwise, health individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, nasal irritability, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
With long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
Not all the pests, but they come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Question about V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what led him to write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada came due to the coronavirus infection in the team for a chance to progress to the highest Spanish football league.
The management of the competition cancelled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 other people infected on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive COVID-19 tests at the club to 28.
Due to the infection in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrad<0xC4><0x83> scored a point to get into the playoffs.
The competition leadership said today that the duel against La Coruni has definitively revoked due to the higher power due to the fact that it has never been played again.
Fuenlabrada made the decision.
On the contrary, La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a storms against non-competition.
In the end, due to the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrad would not be enough to save, but he considers it unfair that the last round was not played according to the custom complete in a single term.
The leadership of a former elite Spanish club is threatened by a court of law due to a fall into the third league.
The first two teams of Huesca and C<0xC3><0xA1>diz have confidence in the process between the elite.
The remaining third place will be played off against Zaragoza, Almer<0xC3><0xAD>a, Girona and Elche.
Karel Gott did not like V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel?!
Dominica's daughter reveals it.
"My father didn't have to do it for many years," said Gotta Dominic's eldest daughter, Aha, with the fact that the Master couldn't come to Havl's name, and whenever a speech came to him, Karla said it was always angry.
It’s hard to say what they did, but according to Dominika, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
“My father said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in the drawer in the dark, but if he somehow resisted, his career would be over,” says Gottov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the end, however, he adds that the Czech giants have only found their way to each other.
"I know that Havel could not have heard the word until he was in his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter, and all of a sudden his dad’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominika recalls.
After all, ten years later, even Gott invited the then former president to celebrate his 70s at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
“And there began a new era of their relationship, because Mr. Havel’s father then regularly invited him home on Bertram,” added the blonde whose father died last October.
The celebrity also hated that he never received a state award from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
After all, it was only in 2009, although it was already from the hands of his successor in the role of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus (79).
Further honours are received in memoriam, the current President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
Since Tuesday, there is a threat of fever in the Czech Republic, meteorologists warn of fires
The high-temperature warnings of meteorologists apply to the entire Czech Republic on Tuesday afternoons except for the Karlovy Vary region and also to southern and central Moravia.
“Excellently, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia,” they say.
People are advised to follow a hot drinking regimen and limit the body load in the afternoon and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a risk of fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists against the risk of fires applies to Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, <0xC3><0x9A>stec, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen Region.
The fire warning will be valid until revocation.
"We do not expect more significant precipitations to mitigate the danger in the northwest and west of Bohemia at least until the end of the week," the Czech Armed Forces said.
The Prague magistrate responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning the distribution of fires in risky locations, which is due to apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires in parks, gardens or forests up to 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will apply until appeal, Prague magistrate spokesman V<0xC3><0xAD>t Hofman said.
