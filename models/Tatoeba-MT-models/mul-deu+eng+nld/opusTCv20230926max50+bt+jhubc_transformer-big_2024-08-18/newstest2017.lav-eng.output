28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found in a supermarket staircase.
But the brother of the vulture says that he can't imagine anyone who would want to do something about his brother, indicating that: "Her life has finally begun to improve."
The body, which was found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Franks Galicia, said a representative of the San Francisco Court of Justice’s Office of Medical Expertise.
The San Francisco Police Department said his death was a homicide and is currently under investigation.
Upura’s brother, Luis Galicia, told the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Franks had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he went to his dream job at the restaurant Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
“We are a small team that works as a family and we will miss him very much,” the representative said.
In this difficult time we think we are together with Frank's friends and family.
Luis Galicia tells us that at the beginning the French stayed in the hostels, but lately life has finally improved.
"He picked up a new apartment and met a girl," Luis told the radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia claims that he doesn’t know who would want to do it to his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
“He always pampered his family by preparing delicious meals and making lunches,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to get involved in a fight.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest of us.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like an unprocessed diamond that glowed brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about what has happened is invited to call SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
Young doctors strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors ask their trade union to start protests in a dispute over the new contract.
The UK Medical Association's (LMA) Young Physicians Committee (JAK) is set to request advice to support broader protests in early September.
JAK believes that ministers have not managed to cast doubt on the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the agreement.
In a message published Thursday evening on Twitter, JAK council member Elena Mackort states that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, JAK's vote has resulted in a complete rejection of the deal offer and a decision has been made to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the silence of the government, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the drafting of new contracts, which will enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors took part in six strikes, including the first time in the history of the NHS to stop work.
After a vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johans Malawana, the new medical representative of the LMA, withdrew from the post.
Before meeting with 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunts informed that the contract would be concluded with the English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: The Abolition Alliance?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to protest and announce the end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
However, while greeting Vladimir Putin with Turkey's leaders in the St. Petersburg castle, it was felt that these partnerships were more needed by Ankara.
However, the two fell in love.
Vladimir Putin's smile seemed succinct and did not cause warm emotions, even considering his usual restraint.
On the other hand, Tajik Erdogan has named Putin as his "dear friend" at least five times, according to an overview of the meeting.
You have a soft number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm provokes conflicting feelings.
However, Putin’s radiant freshness shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the landing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted to the axe.
Putin accused Ankara of infiltrating a dungeon in the back of Moscow.
The surprise was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, the public position of Russia has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television has spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
All of a sudden it seemed that everything was to blame for the Turks.
The most serious accusations were that Erdogan's own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
The benefit of Ankara from the peace accord is obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after a failed coup last month, in which he was tried to gass him.
Countless attacks by terrorists have also shaken his positions.
There are also economic reasons.
Russia's sanctions have caused serious losses, particularly the ban on charter travel, which usually provides for the influx of several million Russian tourists into Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Also, Russian tour operators and charter companies facilitated flights when regular flights will be resumed.
They are looking forward to a holiday of fever in the Mediterranean at the peak of the season.
Already this week the state TV forecasts a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables, as Turkey's import of fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what they believe is a weak reaction to the attempted coup.
All of this can also be seen as dissatisfaction with the lengthy negotiations on EU and Putin's intervention, which is pleased to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has recovered from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing his support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Please note that Moscow understands this well, because the fears of regime change in the country have deepened.
The summit, which took place in this lavish seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as some analyst called it, the "abandoned alliance", the two countries, which feel excluded from the West, are joining forces.
However, despite the unity demonstrated publicly, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main inconsistencies affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, not wanting to disclose the information, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus as to how the two countries could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of open-ended hostile relations and potential disasters, when NATO member Turkey shot down Russian fighter jets, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland
The SKB will continue to play the role of support, announced by the Bank’s Executive Director.
Outside of Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans told the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the Bank’s ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, brand strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from sponsors of international sports, starting with the Six Nations Reggae and ending with Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murej.
However, it has now been decided to put other national labels at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banana will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and official exchange list, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will now also gain attention.
Makevans was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees on Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and with which our employees work, because now we are becoming more of a brand bank."
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now it is said that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring "Six Nations" and will be involved in sponsoring various brands of sports.
“The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have been asking ourselves for a long time how to become a better bank for our customers,” says the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to the hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers, not our own needs, we have obviously made a big change.
We can revive these stamps once again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins 3,000th victory, taking first place in New York City with a horse Predilection
Detori defies the champagne by scoring his 3,000th win twice in the first race at Newmarket.
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Detori won his 3,000th victory in British history, taking the first place in Newmarket.
He achieved this by winning a second victory in these races , which took place in his native city, having to go with the Predilection coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to have achieved such results in horse sprint races.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Peter Eder and William Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who had previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in obstacle races - champion Richard Johnson and career-ending 20-time champion Sir Antonius McCoy, who has set several records in his career, scoring more than 4,300 victories.
Lesters Pigots, the nine-time derby winner, won 4493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of today and it is no surprise that he has achieved successes that only few are able to achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactics feel him different from other jokes.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and charism for years attract fans to this type of sport.
A few weeks ago in the Epsom races I told Frankie that he would have won already 6,000 victories if he didn't take part in just the weekends and big races.
But to be serious, it is a real joy that France has been regularly winning races in the United Kingdom for 30 years.
He is a life-threatening man who excels in British racing, and he is an excellent jockey.
Franks Detori noted this achievement with his company's trademark - flying sledgehammer.
From finishing at wind speed to flying sledgehammer, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been the full path of adventure.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "The Great Seventy" in Askota, in addition to surviving an airplane accident and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he had a hard time returning after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated the strength of his character by challenging those who doubted him to return to his best form.
And he could participate in the races for a while longer - Detori has previously stated that he would be happy to continue participating in the races at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin resigns the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was in Putin’s close circle of people.
At present, a 63-year-old politician has been appointed as the Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian Presidential Administration" without giving a reason.
Antons Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, was replaced by Ivanov.
The 44-year-old Vaino has been killed by a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
As reported on the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later led the administration of the Presidential Protocol and government officials.
After his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work in the position of the President of the country, by drafting laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the post and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Does the smile convince you?
This step has shattered Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is a reasonable and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, was working in the Soviet security service in the VDK.
In this post, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a meeting broadcast on national television, the two men announced that Ivanov was resigning from office on his own initiative.
But despite the camera-focused smiles, which are rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
No one knows that.
However, the official claim that the man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy, is perceived with great scepticism.
Ivanov told Putin in comments on the Kremlin's website: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust me with this complicated position, I might even say, a problematic position, for four years.
It turns out that I have been working in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the State Security Service of the VDK, just like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the VDK, Ivanov assumed the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
At the end of Putin’s second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the presidency of Russia because Putin’s election to the third term would be unconstitutional.
However, another close ally of Putin - Dmitry Medvedev - became president at the time.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the position of president.
The appearance of fish in a garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banff asks for help in order to find out the circumstances of what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be sand ducks that have been abandoned by the aquatic pond.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a fish video on the website of Periscope, hoping that someone could know how these 5 centimeters large fish came into his garden.
Wine Sphere Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The project, currently worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Quinsphere intersection and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The construction of the Fafas bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Projects worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown had returned to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historical moment in the construction of the Winesphere Bridge."
In this project, we see an insurmountable engineering solution, where more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel have been used in the construction of this part alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck is already built and the final stage that connects the bridge to Rosita will be covered today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for installation.
Michael Martins, the director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the engineering construction of the highest class.
After the installation of the last stage of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we deferred the connection of the northern stage of the road with the part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by erecting the northern part of the viaduct 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
It is huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be tilted by about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions, with which the team worked, was only a few millimeters.
Luckily, everything went well.
Simona Bails earns gold in women's gymnastics.
Forget about it.
Forget the anxiety.
Simon Bails doesn't mind all this.
Dynamic jumpers.
Effortlessly performs exercises on the beam.
Impossible to the floor.
Completely innocuous.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 points was higher than the score of silver medal winner and teammate Aliya Raisman and bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina, a Russian athlete.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simona Bails performed a ball-sport workout at the women’s individual multi-match final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Fears became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-match championship title and the fifth best gymnast, gradually strengthening his reputation as the best gymnast of his generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears because the long way to this moment was at an end.
This achievement puts him next to such unbeatable athletes as Michael Felps, who has raised his sport to another level.
Bailsa has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such excellent, precise and ambitious combinations of workouts that the winner of the 1984 Winter Olympics, Marie Lu Retone, was the winner of the competition.
In Brazil, she was awaited by the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the hopes that were set on her, not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas with no gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bails (left) and Aliia Raismane are looking for a gold and silver medal match in the women's individual multi-match final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bails on Tuesday, making special selection coordinator Martas Karolji a farewell party.
Although Bails claims that on his long journey to the tops of fame he had not expected anything like this, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly into the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and discovered by coach Eimias B<0xC5><0xAB>rm<0xC4><0x81>nas’ mother on an excursion to the gym where the B<0xC5><0xAB>rm<0xC4><0x81>nas trenches took place, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost in multi-match competitions since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Bails wants.
Although Mustafa was slightly out of control during two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance bar and free movement - the part of the competition where Bails will defend his champion title, is just ahead.
She advanced to the forefront with a score of 15,433 on the ball and consolidated the management with a score of 15,933 in the free movement
Raismane gently hugged her while she waited for the results, which was only a formality and she burst into joy in tears when a dream that she had once written down in her notebook came true.
Raismane's result was as a small retaliation for the four-year-old events when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, a 22-year-old team captain, called by the Americans as "grandmother", came under convincing leadership.
After the success of the free movement, which cast doubt on her return, she was able to dedicate an air kiss to the crowd.
In the meantime, 19-year-old Bails' viral Twitter entry r, which she posted this week, now has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahajs Braun's "pigeon wreck" survives in Philadelphia in question.
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he is already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's parents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Braun was stabbed several times, including in a circle, in the leg, in the arm and in the abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delore Melendez, told TV: "Her little body was simply smashed in the windows."
I can't believe it.
The boy in a critical condition is placed in the hospital and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start first grade at a local primary school.
Brown is one of only four people shot in a part of the city of Germantown.
Three men were also involved: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
The CBS Philadelphia channel reports that one in 29-year-old men is in a critical condition, while the other two sufferers are in stable condition.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car and the police are investigating whether one of them was an attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that a number of gunmen were most likely involved in the questioning.
The site of the gun cartridge shells are found, which belongs to different weapons.
It looks like it has been a long-term earthquake.
Both sides of the walker’s entrance are found shells.
"So it looks like there were a number of gunmen here who were actively involved in the interrogation," says Philadelphia Police Captain Antonijs Ginaldi.
The damage was also done to several homes and cars.
No one has been arrested yet and police are reported to be checking the surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday, during the shooting, a foul ball hit a 6-year-old girl in the hand while she was playing in front of her house in the Westwood area.
She gradually recovers, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gabi, and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Lightweight Command of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I’ve been at all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team consists of three lightweight athletes, Simon Bails, Gabi Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
You can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is a Jew, and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic.
In the end, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
The best gymnast in the last four years is an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabi took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive outcomes.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas became Olympic champions in an astonishing way, and America was able to draw.
Now the world has seen incredible workouts performed by three-time world champion Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing inexperienced but masterful workouts.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women's individual multi-match.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can offer, but in the rest of the country the situation in the gymnastics hours is completely different.
Simona, Gabi and Laurie entered the Olympic selection as did Ali and Madison.
They are "Olympic Fivesome", because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Marta Carola's coaching job.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Athletes mainly train in private athletic clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for workouts, rooms, trips, outfits, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other issues.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes take all of their workouts, and it is an expensive and long-term investment for lightweight families.
Eimija B<0xC5><0xAB>rmana - Simon Bails' coach and Megija Haini - Laurias Hernandez' coach have been training their athletes since both girls started athletics.
We need to provide young girls, inspired by Simona, Gabi and Laurie, with cheaper workout options.
I founded my own athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organisation is based in Harlem, and we offer over 15,000 city youth (mainly black and Spanish) fitness exercises for free or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (in my hometown) to give local youth a chance to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, bowing and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and goal-setting.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
It is very important to engage in this type of sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Gabby and Madison for the great demonstration of "The Power of Girls" by winning the Olympic Games gold medals and motivating countless new girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of Jeremiah Hant’s offer, the new doctors plan to develop more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by agreeing on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hants announced plans to conclude the contract, stating that the NHS is in an unstable state and that further delays will only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract that provides for changes in the conditions of work at night shifts and at weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, the representative of the new doctors of BMA, Dr. Ellen Makourt, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it deepens the labor crisis and does not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
The remaining eight weeks until the first group of new doctors will sign a new contract, so progress must be made, because there is not much time left.
BMA’s efforts to solve the problem through negotiations have been met with the government’s unwillingness to engage and, at times, with complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open, and that he was a good man.
Jeremiah Hantam should act immediately , stop inactivity and cooperate with new doctors .
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protest actions.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had given the pike.
Ministers hoped to end disputes by agreeing on changes to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to increase the rate of work for 54,000 new doctors who will be affected by new contracts over the weekend.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniels Mortimer called on the new doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that the strikes do not solve anything, but only raise the pressure on the burdened workers and worry, create stress and delays for patients, caregivers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken with the new medical committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about caregivers and reporters.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as the placement of employees, flexible training, in addition to training for those who return after a career break, training costs alone, training costs in a work in a field, training in a field of study in a field of study.
The drug can reduce the risk of heart attack by 2 pounds per day.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds a day, as the official representatives recommend using them in more people and for a longer period of time.
The antiretroviral medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrence of a heart attack.
The NHS, represented by NICE, recommends using this product 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with heart and blood vessel problems.
However, the NICE, currently in charge of the NHS, recommends that this product be used 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
About 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them experience a recurring heart attack or stroke.
Strokes and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, forming obstructions.
If the obstruction breaks, it can cause a thrombus, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the thrombus is separated from the wall of the blood vessels, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of a recurring heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca in the UK and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longson, director of health technology at NICE, explains: “Despite the availability of recurrent heart attack medications, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has severe consequences.”
Fear of a repeated heart attack can leave a negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have experienced it before.
By recommending treatment with Ticagrelor on a provisional basis, we are pleased that we can extend the treatment options to thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, the draft guidelines do not recommend that Ticagrelor be used for more than three years.
The culture of political correctness promotes fraud in Muslim communities during elections
According to the management report, the former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahman, was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that as a result of the culture of political correctness, the eyes are opened to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Ser Erik Pikls criticizes the police, election monitors and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the election process because they are "afraid to affect ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organization, says that voter intimidation for religious reasons is so widespread that police should be allowed to place guards at polling stations to protect those who are intimidated.
He also recommends that voters should present a person's identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, only the name and address of the voters are required.
He even recommends marking the fingers of the voters who voted with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Reporters should also be given greater protection, says Sir Eriks.
He believes that the press should have greater access to the Council's documents and decisions taken by the informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud going hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Dauning Street after a scandal in connection with the Tauerhamlet City elections.
Last year, the special election court decided to remove the mayor of Lutfur Rahman from the city due to the corrupt and illegal activities of the mayor.
The court found that Rahman "cinematically distorted" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign by stating that the religious duty of the faithful Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were falsified or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Also, Ser Eriks points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that the fraud in the postal vote, where senior members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for the candidates they want, is particularly disturbing.
Sers Eriks recommended a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a person’s identity document to clarify the identity of the person.
"The evidence shows that unprotected members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for the community's oldest elected candidates, especially in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan," she said.
"There are concerns that the regional institutions will not pay attention to these problems due to political correctness, as it could affect ethnic and religious interests."
Sergey Eriks outlined 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists from working with votes handed over by mail to prevent "vote-gathering".
The report, which is being examined by Mr Theresa Mei, also called for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present a person’s identity document before the vote.
Mark the fingers of the voters who voted with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematic verification of the nationality of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic voting by postal mail.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes transferred by mail and electoral envelopes for voting by mail.
Ensure that the police have the power to deploy security at the polling stations.
To make changes to the law to facilitate the appointment of persons responsible for intimidation in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1983.
Prohibition of photographing in polling stations.
Specify the requirements in the election boxes to use only English (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the members of the constituencies go to the polls on their own.
Ser Erik ass criticises the Metropolitan Police, expressing a misunderstanding that no charges have been made in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: "The election court only disqualified Luftura Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud."
He was convincingly found guilty on the basis of a criminal evidence standard, on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective "cookie check" of the city council voters in the boxes for voter registration.
Sir Erik points out: "The court decision taken last year is a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the homeland of Parliament, but the alarming and hidden spread of election fraud and the disappearance of the institutions that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.
Riding a bike - Keita's equivalent and other Rio Olympic celebrity equivalents
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics are thrilled about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, which fans have found to be extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete to fight for gold this summer, which, according to the media, is proud of its celebrity counterpart.

Hunter and wolf: United States archer teammate Breedy Elisons, on the left, already since childhood is compared to Leonardo Di Caprio
Apart from Keith’s similarity on the bike path, many people on the internet indicate that this archer could be the twin brother of the superstar Leonardo Di Caprio.
A member of the U.S. men's archery team, Brady Ellisson, caused a storm on Twitter when photographs were posted, where he is very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street.
Also, the athlete himself noticed the storm on social media and recognized that he has been compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood.
“I personally don’t see much similarity except for the beard,” Breider told the Huffington Post.
"He's an excellent chin, so I see it as a compliment."
This year’s popularity will undoubtedly be one of the most popular matches of the 2012 London Olympics: the striking similarity between British telegrapher Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.

Other popular comparisons relate to Kerry Wallace Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linnya. Also gold medal winner Gabius Douglas is proud of a beautiful, wide-ranging smile that resembles Gabriel's heavy smile "Bring It on Uni"
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for his remark that the Chinese swimmer "didn't end up like a pig".
The analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha's fourth place in the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women, caused a shocking storm in CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologise because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the race had "flyed out of the races that died alone" and "did not end up like a pig".
Commentator Bairon MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when 4x200 m freestyle relays for women at the end of the final explained their personal opinion .
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC's commentator team to assign vitality to the comments, said: "That little fourteen-year-old from China can't keep up."
"It was too late for her to get out of the races that she died alone and ended up like a pig."
Thank you very much!
14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan scored in the second stage at 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the score of Canadian Tilore Rucka, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
Viewers all over Canada immediately responded on the Internet, because they were shocked to hear such tones and expressions.
Emets McFarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "finished like a pig"?
The idiot did not realize that they were still in direct air.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free-style finale for women was called "the little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't keep up."
Criticism of Bairon Macdonald quickly came into effect, as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users couldn’t believe when hearing Bairon MacDonald’s unsuspecting comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and because of you, we all sound racist. <0x23>opposite.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was then the CBC broadcaster, apologised for MacDonald's comments, saying: "We are sorry that the comment on the swimming result was echoed live on the air."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
Macdonald’s colleague Scott Russell had to apologize in his place.
CBC then apologised to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and they came to the live air.
Yesterday, we immediately reacted and apologized to all the live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairon's comments were expressed about the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to her personally.
However, in any case, they were unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Bairon deeply regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, Macdonald personally apologised on live air and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
On the CBC Olympic Games live, he said: "I would like to take the moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competitions."
I'm talking about a swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
It's too much to say that I didn't mean to show disrespect and I'm really sorry that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who indulges in unbridled underwear in the middle of a store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman started to get dressed, so that she could keep pants in the middle of the store.
Even worsening the situation, she stopped them to make sure they were attached to her and then pulled her pants back to the store shelf.
She continued to look for clothes at the Folkestone Bouverie Place mall store and kept four more panties.
Primark shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone – the place where this woman kept her underwear and then left it back on the shelf.
At the time, two children's mother, Jenny Davidsone, was also in the store, who tells us that an unknown woman, after wearing underwear, took off her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people were unable to trust their own eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took off her underpants from the shelf, pulled off her socks and pants and measured them on the spot.
She didn’t even try to find a more discrete place to measure them, she just kept them there on the spot.
Everyone watched her pull off her panties and apparently the woman didn’t like them because she just dropped them back on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and dropped the store.
It did not seem that she would be excited, that someone would watch or think about the person who would buy the clothes she wears.
A 33-year-old woman from Kent says: "It's hard to believe that someone will buy clothes that are worn by another person and then not washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidsone adds: "I assume that after she left the store, the store staff took the clothes out of the store shelves - which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine that I could buy a new underwear and find out that another woman has kept it and then they haven’t been cleaned.
The representative of Primark indicated that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Concrete clothes are removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself at close range from gun attackers, we spoke to the Grand Master of Krav Maga from New York, Ron Mizraki.
Whether you’re being attacked from the front or back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and gain control over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then it is necessary to turn first in order to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon must be held between your front arm and shoulder and must be beaten in the face of the opponent with his free elbow.
Then follow the hit with the road through the circle and while the attacker is in pain, he must remove the weapon, face the gun with the slingshot and step back, continuing to turn the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - to avoid the trajectory of the shot, to hold the weapon and to shoot it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the weapon and the opponent must be beaten on the chest and finally he must remove the weapon and withdraw to continue to expose to him.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you are not a master of Krav Maga, then it is safer to return your money to the thief.
The Vand<0xC4><0x81>l<0xC4><0xAB> family demolishes the social house of Salta<0xC5><0xA1>a Kornvola and is laid out on the street.
The Vand<0xC4><0x81>l<0xC4><0xAB> family has been deported from their place of residence for terrorizing their neighbours, causing damage to the social home of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcok, were killed from the property in Salta Cornwall because several complaints were filed about them.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was dumped everywhere, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now detached from the property and most likely lives in some private property.
Donna Makevoya, the manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says that there are concerns that it will not be possible to restore housing.
She tells us that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people can’t live it.
In this case, several factors need to be considered, because in the future, this property in Kornvola will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who had been in possession periodically, and the police say that their terror was manifested as violence, walking down the street with baseball bats, intimidation of locals, drug use, drug trafficking and noise pollution.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, on whom the property belonged, was convicted of anti-social behaviour.
In several decommissioned house rooms, decommissioned waste was found.
In the house, where pre-trade drugs are possible, several floor boards have also been removed.
Neighbors say that they have regularly stepped on the street and were constantly called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forced them out of the property when they were given 11 weeks to be taken out of the house on a voluntary basis.
Disappointed neighbors were very happy with the eviction, because their life had been an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
I can't believe how many times I've seen the police here.
We couldn’t have asked for it this morning.
We wake up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adams Fitzpatrick, who is the head of Neighbourhood Protection at Cornwall Housing Service, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly referred to as the police.
In the mature garden of the house, various old and unusable objects were found.
He also said: "It is very unfortunate that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because getting out of the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very complicated case, because their behavior was extreme and the neighbors had been very hard to monitor their behavior.
I appreciate the work done by my entire team in this case, by the Devon and Cornwall police and commune members, who were brave and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for the neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons here had lived at different times, but all were about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress, which remained on the floor in one of the rooms after laying out.
Service personnel will now have to clean the pile of waste left at home.
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of storing Class B drugs for the purpose of disseminating them.
She insisted that the money was meant to be a memorial to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the spill, it became known that they are currently renting some private property in Plimuta.
Many walls of the house were marked with graffiti.
The police say they will continue to deport tenants who violate their leases.
Devon and Cornwall police representative Angela Krava point out that this deportation is an unequivocal warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said that: "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they please and it will have no consequences."
Devon and Kronvola police do not have acceptable criminal and antisocial behavior, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can give an impetus to the economy.

The mayor of Kannu has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort town of Kannu has banned the wearing of burkini swimsuits on the beaches of this city, which almost completely cover the body of a woman and are very reminiscent of a hydrotribe, local officials said on Thursday.
Mayor of Cannes David Linares has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"The beach outfit, which outwardly demonstrates religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create a risk of disruption of public order (drying, collisions, etc.) that needs to be avoided," says the morning.
"We are not talking about a religious symbol ban on wearing on the beach, but about foreign clothing that is linked to the trust of terrorist movements that are fighting with us," said the head of municipal services, Tjeri Migul.
He added that the burkini swimsuits have not been seen on Kannu beaches since July 28, when the right-wing member of the central party "Republicans" Linar signed this order and it came into force.
This week, an aquapark in the city of Marseille cancelled the planned private events for Muslim women dressed in burqin swimsuits, because the confusion for such an event was expressed by politicians of both the right and left circles.
In France, it is prohibited to wear headdresses of Muslim women wearing face coverings, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack carried out by the group "Islamic State" in the resort town of Kannam, near Nice.
On 26 July, two attackers who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State brutally slaughtered priests in a church in the north-west of France.
"Jysk" pern tumor turnover of 5%
The retailer of household goods SIA "Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" ("Jysk") acquired a tumor turnover of 5%, reaching 23,66 million euros, according to the information of "Firmas.lv".
The company’s turnover in 2014 was 22.57 million euros.
The profits of the company also increased slightly - from 781 235 euros in 2014 to 785 896 euros pern.
The management report states that last year the company reconstructed its existing store in Riga, Slokas Street, and closed its store in Riga, Kurzeme Avenue.
This year, as in other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
In the meantime, it is recommended to leave the profits earned undivided.
"Jysk" is an international network of stores that offers goods for the maintenance of the home.
Jysk Linnen'n Furniture Ltd. was founded in 2001.
The capital of the company is EUR 3 500 264.
The company is owned by the Icelandic company "Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC".
What is the best way to do this is to make sure that you have a good time?
I eat immediately after baking, then they will be the hottest.
The fish fillets and whiskers are caught together in a meat machine.

The festival "Kubana" started in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11, in the evening of Lucavsala, one of the last festivals of this summer was started - there until Sunday night "Cuban".
In the first evening, groups such as "Enter Shikari" from the UK were asked, which was expected in the morning, but did not disappear from the program, American banks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival, there are noteworthy words in the popular program - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", punk rock legend "Ramones" bundler Marky Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" and the punk rock program.
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
In the meantime, it suffered financial failures and huge losses, but it did not stop the organizers from rehearsing - they added a long sign to the title, included in the program a number of Latvian bands (in the past and the past for the past tense on Friday evening 19:15 on the set "All Day").
Whether these efforts will justify, still too early to judge, because the festival was only celebrated, but, as "Delfi Entertainment" observed on the first night, at least for the time being huge efforts to attract people have not succeeded and the number of visitors was similar to the other.
The British cycling team doubles the Olympic record and wins the sprint.
The British strike team doubled the Olympic record on Thursday and won the men's sprint races.
The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in qualifying, but in the first round of the competition it was again corrected by the New Zealanders.
In the sprint final, the British team met with New Zealand, and the British took the title of Olympic record holders to the New Zealanders, leaving them with silver medals.
The British team won the final with 42,440 seconds, beating the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the battle for bronze, the French team outperformed Australia.
It should be added that the record was also improved in the qualification of the women's rape ride - the UK team improved the world record, which is now 4:13,260.
The President who remained in the shadows: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12th, the 145th anniversary of the birth of the second Latvian President Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the Latvian state, but it has remained largely in the shadow of the first Latvian President J<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>s <0xC4><0x8C>akstes and the last president of the pre-war period, K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Ulmanas.
None of our fellow citizens has so much defended democracy and the rule of law as Zemgals, Arnold Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> writes in a book about Gustav Zemgals published ten years ago.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
The rest are such stiff, always very right.
He was taught not to be like this, today it might be similar to what Raimond Väjonis is.
“He was the one who was close to the people,” says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Today’s politicians know history poorly, they refer to Karl Ulman as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how negligent he was.
The only person at the government meetings to whom he did not shout was General Balodis.
Even if in the pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"The scent with its sense of humor and democracy leaves the exact opposite impression," Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> says.
Professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia Aivars Stranga agrees with "Delfi" Auzi<0xC5><0x86>a's assessment of Zemgala as a calm and esteemed citizen.
He also notes that Zemgals stood out with respect to minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At the time, it was not a customary act, after the presidency of Zemgala Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and weighted man who had to talk for a long time to become president.
He didn’t want to do it, he just didn’t want to be famous.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but he believed that the president should definitely understand it.
"During the presidency, the basics of the French language were both learned," explains Strange.
Zemgals did not allow him to be persuaded to run again, he did not like the really high positions.
In any case, he is a very respected person in Latvian history, already before his arrival to the President's castle he was in a serious position - he was a highly sought after notary.
Zemgals was also the leader of the famous Zemgala kasi Suvorova street 3, where the accumulator and lender association was located, in which the government practically negotiated the same as the Latvian state.
He has always been progressively aligned.
He wasn’t a big fan of Ulman, but he didn’t object to it in public either.
“In private talks, it has been stated at times that Ulman’s actions really do not sympathize with him,” says Stranga.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How do you remember Zemgala these days?
Unfortunately, for the most part, he associates himself with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, the views were central.
"There were no major shocks during his time, that is, he could associate himself with a truly stable presidency," Strange sums up.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, there was also a Latvian state visit to Sweden, which during that time indirectly meant Latvia's full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of the democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals visited Stockholm on a state visit.
The visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away forever in January 1939.
Just ways to help the child to cope with the rage of accidents.
I often come across the fact that the appearance of anger in the child, the appearance of nausea by parents is considered something wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" is indicated by psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small discussion about these so natural and human feelings - the anger and agitation that each person experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity aimed at another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we are adults, we are angry, anxious - usually we know what is going on with us and how to deal with it.
We can express our angers and awkwardness in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, hold on to yourself, tell about it to your friends or other close ones, we can in anger rip off the couch, smoke a cigarette for a drink.do not smoke a cigarette, do not smoke a cigarette, do not do it!
We do not turn our aggression against others, because we know different other ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they are visited by anger, do not understand what is going on with them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", you're a fool, "Bad mom," "I don't see you," "I won't mess with you" - and very rarely can you say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and genuine in the manifestation of their feelings, and are often also in the grip of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, not to talk about it and nerves, but on the contrary - to help the child.
Do you need a break in relationships?
A long day of work, in which everything has not gone the way you would, or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would want for a moment, a day or even longer to "disconnect" from the whole world.
Is it possible to press the relationship for a moment and breathe a little?
Does that mean, however, that each of the partners is on their own path?
In their opinions, gentlemen of different ages share.
John (23) is short and numerical: "In my opinion, if you need a break in a relationship, then you are not with the real person".
In the meantime, Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that might be able to help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall on your nerves for every little detail, then certainly - this is the right moment when you should explore other hunting grounds to understand whether you miss him or especially about him not thinking about him or even not wanting to see him again.
So the answer is - yes, taking a break can help you save time and understand how important the other side is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, relationships need to keep a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to get angry at each other, especially if there’s nothing else to talk about but what you’ve done during the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I have not been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment about the fact that it is better somewhere else or by another - then why this woman with whom you are together, has deserved someone who might think that there is not enough good here and behind the mountains there are the fields of paradise?
Thinking alone is already a small betrayal.
I'm not, then I'm not.
"I have, so a little condemn those who don't." says Edmunds (46).
Karl (33) has the exact opposite of my opinion.
I think everyone needs a moment to catch up.
You can't look each other in the eye every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and yell for love that never goes away.
Attopies!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everyone has their own time.
Of course, even a friend or wife, however, if both are able to maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live to the edge of the grave.
That and only that.
Marti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> (27) says: "It's hard to say whether or not it's necessary, should or should not take a break, but one thing is clear - they suggest something in a relationship to the end, something is missing."
If this question is solved, then it should be calculated that in the near future there will be some changes - on the right or the wrong side, it depends on themselves.
I think while you're still young and crazy, while you need a break - some of the time, but when everything stays serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no talk about rest.
You decide to spend the rest of your life together!
"If you can't stand each other's society now and need a room once in a while, then what will happen when you're retired, commenting on how long-haired cats bark or arguing about which day the garden should be better cared for," explains Kristaps (19).
All the words of the Lord have been changed.

For the moment, nothing is officially happening.
"If so, then I will announce it to the BBC," Leblanc said in a televised interview with critics.
The future of "Gas on the Floor!" was created in July, when Leblanc's master Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the broadcast.
After his departure, Evans acknowledged that Leblanc and "Gas in the Floor!" were "as created for each other".
Evans describes the star of the former series "Friends" as a "true and kind man", thus shouting rumors that the two had seen their friendship during the filming.
When asked by Leblanc what he liked most about the show, he replied that he was traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.

Kalvin<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>: Meldonija could be removed from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this year.
It is expected that meldonium in the composition of the drug Mildronats produced in Latvia could be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this year, Ivars Kalvi<0xC5><0x86>, the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, said on Friday morning on LNT, 900 seconds.
He said he would go to Canada in September to discuss the meldonium issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

In Sigulda, in the street of Switzerland, two cyclists collided, suffering various injuries, the State Police reports.
The accident involved males born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were transported to a medical institution.
You can also find a biker in Koknese.
In 1989, the man fell on the street in 1905 and was taken to medical care.
In 1989, a motorcyclist was born in Dobeles county, Naud<0xC4><0xAB>tes county, in an attempt to avoid a dog that ran off on the road and got drunk.
He's in the hospital, too.
In the past 24 hours, 71 road traffic accidents were recorded in Latvia, in which 16 people were injured.
You'll have to lie down and get cooler.
On Friday, there will be some expected short-term rain in Latvia and it will be some degree cooler, the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre (LETA) reported.
There is a possibility of suffocation in places.
According to forecasts, rain is expected mainly in Kurzeme and Vidzeme in the north.
The maximum air temperature will be only <0x2B>16, <0x2B>19 degrees.
In Riga, the day goes by without rain and mostly the sun shines.
However, the air will not be warmer than <0x2B>18 degrees.
U.S. modeling business will be overshadowed by the brilliance of the perverted exquisite photo session and the impatience of the horror film that he has portrayed.
In essence - a very provocative, balancing work on exquisite and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw the line between the European art house film and the territory of the Hollywood genre product.
The film with Vigo Mortensen focuses on the question of whether the conceptually chosen lifestyles of the parents (ecological, vegetarian, alternative and delimitation from the stupidity and values of the consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to the child.
The idealist father of six children after the death of his wife is confronted with questions about the correctness of the choices and the true values.

Of course, the shark does it as an attack on the beautiful girls - in the Jockeys it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, portrayed by Blake Laviglia.
The work demanded from her a fundamental heroism.
This survival solo number can be compared with a demonstration of James Frank's acting mastery in the film 127 hours and a Ryan Reinolds game in the film Description of Life.
It is possible that the main roles of the artist Mila Kunis are also at fault, whose transformations from an exemplary person to a creative person and his family values seem to have only been created by the imaginations of the desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State militants, fleeing from Menbija, Syria’s Aleppo province, have kidnapped some 2,000 civilians who are being used as living turrets, a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and observers announced on Friday.
“We didn’t shoot them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Djerabul,” a spokesman for the Kurdu Menbija Military Council said.
After two months of slump by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, on Friday announced that Menbija had been liberated from jihadists.
The Islamic State took over the Menbija in 2014.
QSD has already last week extended most of the Islamic State fighters from Menbija, but some have withstood and showed strong resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking the spoils with them.
Islamists go to Djerabul, which is located on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State kidnapped about 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that the Islamists had kidnapped the city's residents' cars, forced people to crash in them, and then taken them to Djerabul.
Islamic State fighters have also previously committed mass abductions of people.
In January, Islamists seized territory in the province of Deir ez Zora in eastern Syria and kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
Later, about 270 Islamists were freed from the conquests.
How many Islamic State fighters have escaped from Menbija is not known.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbija Military Council reported that QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people who had been captured by Islamists in Menbija.
The information gathered by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the battle for the Menbi<0xC5><0xBE>i.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova refuses to run for the post of head of the VID.
The head of the State Environment Service Inga Kolegova decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the agency LETA was informed in the Ministry of Finance.
You will be able to find a way to make sure that you have a good time with your family and friends.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible but more often invisible interests of politicians and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
“It’s not acceptable to me either,” says the former candidate for the post of VID director.
In the event that her candidacy would be approved in the government, it would be clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the necessary changes to be fully worked out and implemented in the VID, feeling the full support of the government.
Without it full-fledged work would not be possible, concludes Kolegov.
“I have often publicly stated that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is too politicized,” explains the official.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have shown, it is an experience that I value as a benefit," Kol<0xC4><0x93>geva writes in the submission to Reisniece-Ozola.
The unit said Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegov there were "substantial contradictions" between the candidate's explanations and the information available in the public registers on the costs of dividends of SIA Pallogs, as the publicly available decisions of the meetings of the members of the Pallogs provide for the non-sharing of profits.
Currently, Deputy Director-General Dace Pel<0xC4><0x97>ka is the Director-General of the VID.
In Livna, the police are involved in the rescue of two unsupervised children, the administration of the State Police of Latgale Region informs.
The report of unsupervised strollers with infants was received on Friday at 7 a.m.
They were located in Livna near the former store building.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to the doctors to provide assistance.
There was also a bag of documents and a mobile phone left in the carts.
In less than half an hour, law enforcement officers identified the possible location of the child’s parents and went there.
When the woman arrived at the civilian’s house, police found out that the woman was sleeping because she was in a high alcoholic state.
In the evening of 1992, after the previous day of the initial information, a woman born went to a friend’s house where she drank alcohol.
When she went home after a joint nausea, the woman decided to leave the children at the store under unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the barrister, who will also decide on the future fate of the children.
Riga Libertad has introduced all the recommendations of the UK regarding the Russian island project.
Riga Liberties Administration has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (UK) regarding the project on the development of infrastructure on the Russian island for the transfer of port activities from the implementation of the city center, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
Approval of the project is planned at the nearest meeting of the Riga Freedom Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the UK, in preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Free Trade Authority was also guided by the conclusions and achievements of the legal and operational audit in the project workshop conducted by the international auditor Deloitte Riga Freedom Management.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Libertarian Government does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the feasibility of implementing the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the donor - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all the construction works planned within the project are fully completed within the time limits and within the planned scope.
"To prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and also the reinforcers that the main objective of freedom is the successful implementation of the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UK regarding the management and supervision of the project in Sand<0xC4><0xAB>ya.
The existing long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring of the project’s objective was supplemented by the most important planned actions of the parties involved and the necessary decision deadlines, the definitions of meetings and regular reports, as well as the definitions of the final marks and their deadlines, the planned process builder.
The approved action plan for the achievement of the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the UK, was supplemented by implementation monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the time-limits of the activities of the other parties involved in the project by the Riga Libertarian Party.
To improve project management and to mitigate potential risks, a project management plan has been redesigned, defining the areas of project management and specifying the documents developed that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the project capacity, a project management framework has been developed, which reflects the structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the employees.
In order to improve the communication of Riga’s free administration with the parties involved in the project, a plan of communication of the parties involved in the project has been developed, which in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the principles of the project’s successful completion and the principles of the period of the project, the information of the parties involved.
In turn, in order to improve control over the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the opening of a procurement contract and the rule of law will need to be justified in more detail in the future.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built a port infrastructure that meets world standards - four new deep-water ports, railway ports, as well as engineering communications.
The co-financed constructions of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the previous year, achieving a financial savings of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.6 million.
In Slovakia, security at airports has been increased due to threats.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia on Friday stepped up security measures at several airports, the Interior Ministry said.
"Given the threats, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ice," a spokesman for the Slovak Ministry of the Interior told AFP on Friday.
“The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analyzing the information we have received,” he added.
The Slovak capital will host an informal European Union (EU) summit on 16 September, which will be attended by all the countries of the bloc except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the UK Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without the UK.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the death toll at the communist junction in the former East German border may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true death toll have still not been raised.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Checkpoint Charlie Museum of the Berlin Wall, during the period from 1945 to 1989 at the border with the Western Allied zones and the later Western Communist authorities have killed 1841 people who tried to control the territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years now and adjusts the number of victims from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including among the victims, including a six-year-old boy who drowned while his family was trying to get to Western Germany through Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the young victims of the Berlin Wall are also deserts of the Soviet army.
"The extent of the damage inflicted by the double evils of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," admits Aleksandra Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the communist-controlled country are maintained and not lost," Hildebrandes said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is inconclusive," says Johannes Stats, an expert on the history of Eastern Europe at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases.
Researchers have previously estimated that 138 people were killed by communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
Taking into account those people who died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or get into the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is considerably less than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide of East German border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors between the ages of 70 and 80 die from a heart attack after border checks," Hildebrante believes, it should have the consequences of this "brain border".
However, the State is convinced that it is necessary to make a distinction between the old people, who may have died as a result of their treatment, and those whose death was caused by a long waiting in a hot bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims, it is not easy to register, because the communist authorities of the East Germany did not collect such statistical data, and the researchers have to extract the documents in various scattered archives, states St<0xC3><0xA1>ts.
However, the State Group has recently collected new documents, and therefore it could come up with an estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone goes to Rio with the accreditation of the coach; the same is a surprise.
In recent days, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro, came with the accreditation of the coach, but he was surprised.
On Wednesday, wide agitation was caused by the statements of Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakovas coach Germana Jakubovska, who revealed that at the last moment Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro decided to go to Pone while the trainer had to stay at home.
Initially, swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, coaches Jakubovskis and Deivs Kolinss, as well as the president of the federation Pone, were confirmed in the list of riders.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for five participants to the Olympic Games, and even before the departure, Aldons Vrubljevskis claimed that Germans will have and he is looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not," Pone said, expressing the view that it did not affect Ribakova's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvja's trainer set out to help her.
The pony, who is himself a member of the LOK Executive Committee, has already criticised the LOK’s activities by blaming the Olympic sports watchdog.
In my view, it is unethical for the Executive Committee of the LOK to approve five persons and not to remove any of them.
"I don't know why there wasn't enough room for the Swimming Federation," Pone said, adding that the work of the federation and its presidents has not been evaluated in society, reminding that the presidents of the federation do not receive salaries.
Pone also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he addressed the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) with a complaint and urged Latvians not to feel guilty.
Pone, however, could not tell why he had the accreditation of a coach at the Olympic Games, who probably had to go to Jakubovski.
"I was nominated as a federation president (team leader) but for unknown reasons I got coach accreditation and now I'm not going anywhere inside."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last minute I think Germans will be, because I didn’t have any other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before the start of Ribakova she had an eye-to-eye conversation with Poni and after her swimmer had been with lice in her eyes, however, the president of the LPF himself said that it had been a daily conversation with the desire to start with the athletics.
Pone reminded that the LPF monitors five sports that are in the Olympic programme, and four of them are also training for children in Latvia.
The president of the federation said that the issues of convergence are also very important in Latvia and also he spoke about such programmes, Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro having been in the country for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup stage could be tackled in Latvia.
Staying in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programs.

During the programme of fish resources restoration of AS Latvenergo this week in Daugava near Mangalsala, salmon and measles are being introduced, and this year it is planned to introduce more than 600,000 annual salmon and measles which have been grown in the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Domes.
Latvian agency LETA informed that the introduction of fish will continue in the coming months - 6,300,000 different species of fish and cabbage are introduced into the watercourses of the Daugava basin each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016 there will be released lizard and birch hatchlings, in June - lizards, in July - single-summer salmon, in August and September - sandalwood and vimbas.
M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC5><0x86>ickis, Production Director of Latvenergo, said that concern for the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvenergo Group.
"In the conservation and reproduction of fish resources, every action is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both by carrying out the cultivation and introduction of fish toddlers in the Daugava basin, as well as by carrying out other activities," said the Minister.
This year, more than 600,000 annual salmon and measles babies will be introduced into the Daugava pond.
For the second year, babies of fish are marked before insertion by cutting the grease bar.
Today, 25,000 salmon puppies weighing 31,3 grams are brought in the cargo.
Every year, in the composition and numerical volume of scientifically-based species in Daugavpils and its basin shall be introduced into the watercourses of the fish and crustaceans.
Reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava and its basin in accordance with the regulatory acts is carried out by the Bior on the basis of an expert analysis of the loss of fish resources as a result of Latvian economic activity and by providing a conclusion on the amount of resources to be compensated for, to ensure that measures are to be taken.
The National Environment Service, on the basis of that expertise, decides on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual compensation amount of Latvians in the programme for the recovery of fish resources is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We Fish" for the fifth year, places 400 artificial fish nests in Daugava near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ile.
Cooperation with the association in promoting the natural reef of fish is an additionally supported initiative in the framework of the Latvian Fish Resources Renewal Programme.
The placement of artificial nests in the reservoir is an important measure that promotes the conservation and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
The festival "Sansusi Concert Hall" is a rural courtyard, forest, circus.
You sleep in a tent, eat like a restaurant, walk in chains and listen to explored chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature, - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansusi, which already invites the third summer to Akn<0xC3><0xAD>stes county.
The festival will take place in Susaias - a village that no longer exists - in the yard of the former farmhouse, next to the forests and in the woods.
On three days - from 12 to 14 August - you can combine the carefree enjoyment of natural and academic music on five stages.
Here the theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations meet with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the rigidity of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to the smile on the face and ease of walking only a few minutes.
"Please do not search for the program, because we have consciously chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real Sansusi taste can only be captured by spending all three days in it", invites the initiator of the festival.
The festival gates will be opened on Fridays at 5:00 p.m., and the first concert is at 7:00 p.m.
Of course, there will be programs on site with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most satisfying - from 9.00 a.m. until the next morning.
"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
In the wonderful collection of artists, there are, for example, violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Krist<0xC3><0xAD>ne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter J<0xC4><0x81>nis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zari<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, pianist Ziru<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x87>, quartet Quadra and Kir<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1> gai<0xC5><0xA1>.

Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will appoint Garland to the Supreme Court as a judge.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reid, is convinced that in case she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland’s approval since President Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch Makonnels has announced that the next president will be elected, who will replace the current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Skaliu.
On Thursday, during his conference, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
A spokeswoman for Reida later announced that he had not personally spoken to Clinton on this subject and that these were merely speculations.
He praised Garland and stated that the Clinton team would not want to "push the boat" with another choice.
Garlands is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District Court of Appeals.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "intruders" and are acting in the interests of Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presidential candidate.
He also said that Trump is not suitable for the president's job.
Treats announces a calendar of nude photos for women and men.
The magazine Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 Pirreli calendar in the style of the 70s of the last century.
In its 2017 NU M<0xC5><0xAB>zu calendar, it is planned to showcase new supermodels, not celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, the president of Treats magazine Steve Shows announced that his erotic art magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's also talking about the calendar.
In a press release on the creation of the calendar, Shaw writes: "We need to return to the indistinct and classic depiction of cowardice in the images, where the female body does not spoil, but the inspiration of both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is an excellent work of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person during casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
The buyer retweeted, trying a motorcycle, scrambled.
On August 10, at 10 a.m. a motorcycle "Yamaha YZ250" was stolen from the courtyard of a house in Rembate county, which has not been registered, the State Police informs.
The owner of the motorcycle with the help of advertising had wanted to sell the power plant.
At the turn of the day, a potential buyer arrived, got on the motorcycle as if to try it and left.
The officers of the Ogre Police Department of the Riga Region Administration of the State Police shall request the withdrawal of anyone who may provide any information useful for the investigation in connection with the criminal offence.

Greenland shark is the longest-living spine - video view
Scientists claim that the Greenland sharks have the longest life span of all the vertebrates on our planet.
According to Julius Nielsen, the longevity record belongs to a mother who may be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejects the claim to dismantle shops in the "Dschungel" refugee camp.
The French court rejected the authorities' claim to dismantle dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the "Dschungel" camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In this week's court hearing in Kale, the authorities indicated that the state should dismantle 72 self-established shops, where people in the camp area sell various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks in restiros, offer services for the hairdresser in daisies, tea for 50 cents (40 cents).
The prefecture’s office in Kale pointed out that these self-established enterprises must be dismantled because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose fire and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and the support groups does not provide for the needs of the camp, in which the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelters and food to those who need it the most.
The Lille court decided that there is no legal basis for expelling people who have set up 72 self-established stores, but it understands the concerns of the prefect of Kale.
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely unsafe conditions".
He pointed out that these places are a peaceful meeting place for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of disruption is the Jungle Book Kids camp cafeteria, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French lessons and provides advice on asylum for hundreds of unprotected minors without adult escorts.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition for the protection of a children’s café.
According to a letter to the Guardian, the liquidation of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, the two charities "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of residents of the "Dschungel" camp has increased to 9,000 people, which is the highest figure since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
The United Kingdom wins silver in a series of battles in which the Fiji State Union wins gold.
The impressive performance of the UK selection in the rebby-7 series ended on Thursday, when in the exciting final match "Deodoro" at the Rio Fiji Stadium, the National Union of Fiji convinced them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in ball management, playing balls with the foot, supporting play and playing brutal force, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history of existence.
The defeat brought a reputable peace of mind award – a silver medal that was Britain’s third medal today. The British team can be proud of their achievements in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the heavyweight semi-final, in which the Boxing team suffered a defeat with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, it is possible to play for the United Kingdom in the final.
But in any case, Fiji's selection is currently in its best shape to win 15 men's teams.
While unlikely, a known reassurance for the UK could be the fact that at least one British won a gold medal. This is Fiji's head coach Bens Raines - a former England coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Raien, they lost all the games in the rebja-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Defeat is painful, but growth is astonishing.
The Fiji impressively began the match, deflecting the techniques of the British force for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like colliding with a number of opposite-facing buses, and the World Series champions took the lead with 5:0, when Osea Kolinisau won the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the excess further, realizing the landing in the right wing.
The result was 12:0 and the British team didn’t even really touch the ball.
Michelle's excellent technique of strength did not allow the late Leoni Nakaravam to score three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji's result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalu scored in the right corner, consolidating the lead over Great Britain to 17:0.
After the overtime Nakarava increased the excess even further and by the end had remained more than a minute... by the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some misdeeds of British force techniques and crossed the line by earning points.
The landing resulted in a score of 29:0.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby-7 games while the British were just learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made a major change in the half-time, overseeing the Fiji player line... a full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, won a few more points.
Denam Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing in the left corner and achieving a score of 36-7, but the game was already lost while fans of the South Seas liners sang, waved the flags and danced in the stands.
It is not surprising to see Fiji’s life-sustaining attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even sweeter by another touchdown at the end of the game.
At the end of the game, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British were only able to sit in the hall after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where in a very lively fight both teams won downhill and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kails Brauns led the Box team, but in the second half Dens Norton crossed the line with brilliant mastery and delivered the ball between the poles, giving the British a victory.
Mark Watson, who is the brother of England's regby-15 player Antonia, the excellent technique of force at the end of the game provided the team with a victory and another silver medal.
The trainer's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heter Staning to win the air races.
It will be the most exciting gold medal in these races and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, the golden moment of Helen Glover and Heteres Staning played a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although only two athletes are on board, she was accompanied by the support of Robin Williams, who inspired her to earn up to the second Olympic gold medal in the pairing of women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
She was unquestionably dominated because she won an unbeaten, unprecedented victory for the 39th time.
The two great athletes with the elegance of the bowl sliding on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal win is a whole team that works hard so that athletes constantly improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success was given by a coach, who did not even know 30 months ago whether to experience this day of cone because he was a tinkerer.
He said that it disappeared as quickly as it appeared, as soon as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on and so did it.
If I didn’t, it would spread all over my body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The trio were pleased that William could initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 mid-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if that may be said.
I needed an income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated the recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked 6, 10 and even 15 meters long, although the doctor said that a few steps would suffice.
It all started.
Airing on its own is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought immediately was of William, who had been very anxious all morning and was more excited than usual.
Staninga, who has served at the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robins have worked.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can’t think of a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glovere and Heter Staning have not lost in any race in five years.
The pair achieves such a huge speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Staning and Glover's predominance was too great.
We felt every moment of it.
Helena yelled, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is very important not to lose concentration.
We got a good start, but at the same time we didn’t have high hopes.
We didn’t want to break records that day, we just wanted to air well and win the races, and we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventure seeker Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time, it took about four minutes.
She said, "It feels great."

According to him, now the Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>rim Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inskim (Greens and Farmers' Union) and the Minister of Finance Danai Reisniecei-Ozolai (Greens and Farmers' Union) are already "principally important" to approve the position of the head of the VID.
Rajevskis predicted that the approval of the head of the VID in this government, both Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski and Reisniecei-Ozolai, was the "first major decision" that could affect him as a politician's future.
If now begins to change the position of the head of the VID in the election of the candidate, then it will have a negative impact on the state administration of their image.
The agenda of the next week’s meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the question of the transfer of Kolegov, the head of the VVD, to the post of Director General of the VID, as evidenced by the government’s agenda.
Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egov headed the post of Head of the VID by Minister of Finance Reisniece-Ozola after In<0xC4><0x81>ra P<0xC4><0x93>tersone resigned from office and when the competition for the post of Director General of the VID ended without results.
If you are not aware of the fact that you are not a member of the public, you are not a member of the public, and you are not a member of the public, but a member of the public.
The Minister of Finance later acknowledged that no other candidates for the post of head of the VID were being considered for the time being.
In addition, the head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, Raivis Dzintars, acknowledged that the NA continues to support Kolegov's leadership of the VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit threatens the inability to form a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) submitted an opinion that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce the deficit level to the required 3% of the euro area's gross domestic product (GDP).
The calculations show that, despite the austerity measures implemented, the Portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year stood at 4.4% of GDP, while in Spain it stood at 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the foreseeable future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on the two countries mentioned is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative outlook.
Critics both point out that the EC is inconsistent in its decisions, agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then not being able to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the Federal Bank of Germany, Jens Veidmann, pointed out that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, creating the public's perception that the rules of the European Union are recommendable, not binding.
The Commission has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the time limit for fixing the deficit for Portugal until the end of this year and for Spain until 2018.
The European Commission promises to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce additional austerity measures if conditions so require.
The initial projections show that Portugal's target could be achieved within the set time frame and the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of its gross domestic product already this year.
This means that under the Stability Programme, the government of this country will have to implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, paying additional attention to the cost control of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should be 0.5% of GDP each year for the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months has made it particularly difficult to achieve these goals, and the chances are increasing that Spain may have to hold a pre-term parliament for the third time in a year.
However, public opinion polls show that the political scene of the third election in the country would not change significantly either.
The most popular party is still the popular party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoj, whose election would again win an incomplete 33% of the vote.
Its popularity has increased slightly only by the socialists, while the popularity of the party "Podemos" or "Together We Can" against the austerity measures has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wants to get Socialists and Ciudadanos involved in the government again this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval the draft budget for 2017 by mid-October.
As stated by Rafaels Hernando, the representative of the People’s Party’s parliamentary group, if the government fails and the parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will be a laughing stock for the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
When surveying the beaches for the fifth year, activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of wastes found each year is increasing, and most of the visitors to the bathing sites are to blame.
The most polluted bathing sites are right in Riga.
In the capital city council, it is clear that swimming spots are well-maintained every day, but it is very difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land during rainfall can be rinsed in water, thereby seriously damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja Beach and some places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This message was distributed this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
In the fifth year, when measuring the road along the Gulf of Riga, activists concluded that the number of waste left by residents has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, this critical assessment has come into play.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of wastes per 100 meters of the beach may even exceed 200 units," says J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Latvian Radio called, he was on the beach of T<0xC5><0xAB>ja, where the volunteer walk along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, among the various household waste and picnic-remaining activists, we have to collect even daylight bulbs, which are left in the sands of the sea.
The participant and organizer of the hike Ulme says that the contamination is directly responsible for the inhabitants.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the decomposition stage, they can no longer be identified by skein, and smoky.
Among the dirtiest beaches are also swimming spots in Riga.
For example, an average of almost 800 waste units are collected in Daugavgriva every hundred meters, which is a critical amount.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that smoking and not everywhere signs of warning or prohibition are also present when you take every step of the way.
"Average figures for all three Riga bathing sites together - Daugavgriv, Vakarbu<0xC4><0xBC>i and Ve<0xC4><0xBC><0xC4><0xBC>i - unfortunately come together large and far above the desired goal, which seems to be Latvia's goal, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 per unit of environment by 2020.
Cleaning of bathing facilities in Riga is carried out every day, even twice in the hottest summer days, explains the representative of the council Ugis Vidauskis.
However, the fight against the dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We are going back to these people's cultural issues.
"On those who allow, use alcohol, smoke and do all the things that should not, even special signs do not work," says Vidauskis.
Vidauskis therefore invites the visitors to the bathing area to report the contamination to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps some new warnings can be imposed, but, as I said, this will hardly radically change the situation.
"As everyone should simply turn to each other and be intolerant of such offenders," he emphasizes.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can establish a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, the quality of the water is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that in all 56 bathing sites the water quality has been good all the time and there are no swimming restrictions.
"Once again, we will take analyses at the end of August," says Normands Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>is, the senior environmental health specialist of the inspection.
During heavy rainfall, waste left on land may be rinsed in water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to an environmental expert.
The rotation of the Russian elite continues - the change of the leader in the Putin administration.
The mother's own brain?
Vladimir Putin told the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov would leave the post on his own and would continue to be the President's Special Representative on Nature Conservation, Ecology and Transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin paid tribute to Ivanov in front of the television camera: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have worked with you for many years and we have been doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you are fulfilling the duties entrusted to you.
I am well aware of our agreement not to use you as head of the Presidential Administration for more than four years.
That is why I will understand how I can cope with your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope that you will make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new position too.
However, it is pointed out that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important post and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Considering that next month's state council elections are to be held in Russia, rumors have been raised that this step is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called Putin's possible deputy in the post of president, so the claim that he himself wanted to take up the position of the president's representative in matters of nature conservation and transport raised doubts.
As the Lsm.lv archive shows, Ivanovs is the Chief of the General Staff of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a sensible and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in the specialties in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of his reign, the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Doctrine of Information Security" was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, but already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of enterprises of the Russian defence industry and arms exports.
Now, after the dismissal of the head of the Presidential Administration, Ivanov will also retain his place on the National Security Council of Russia, where the new head of the Presidential Administration, Vaino, also works.
The blame comes from the family Soviet party in the elite.
The position of the head of the Presidential Administration, Vaino, was recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
From the time we worked in the government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years, we have been communicating practically every day.
"Therefore, I am convinced that according to all the professional and personal qualities of character he is ready for this work," said Ivanov.
The wine comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl took up high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including for ten years until 1988 he was its first secretary.
The online edition of "Medusa" with reference to the book "The Self-Determination and Independence of Estonia" writes that in the late 1980s Karls Vaino had asked Moscow for permission to apply force against the participants of the demonstrations.
However, he had received a rejection and soon lost his post.
Shortly thereafter, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
It has been reported that in recent weeks Russia has been shaken by the deportation and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors of several regions and federal representatives.
As noted by political scientists, President Vladimir Putin will reshuffle the ruling elite before the upcoming 2018 elections.
One of the main features - more and more often at leading positions are representatives of the structures of force.
Judo cyclist <0xC5><0x8C>kiforenko also loses in the first match of the Olympic Games.
This was the first round of the fight, and the Latvian judo cykstone has finished its participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
When you are in a relationship with your partner, you are in a relationship with your partner, and you are in a relationship with your partner.
He also discovered that judo chickstone suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
Interestingly, in order to get to the Olympic milestone, <0xC5><0x9A>ikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - that is, in a weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani chickstone was 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko in the fight in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki held for two and a half minutes until the opponent scored a clean winning shot.
This means that the Latvian judo competition Rio has ended.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by Judith Yevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent against him, but sometimes ambitions are able to provide a surprise.
He didn't stop.
Art<0xC5><0xAB>r <0xC5><0x9A>ykiforenko's task was even more difficult, because the experience was smaller and the opponent was also respectful.
The result is similar, although on the tatami he held the tee for a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately Latvian jihadists lack exactly the most ambition.
Since the leadership of the federation passed by Gunnar Kirson and his financial stud Vladimir Shestakovs, Alexander Jackevich left Latvia, there is no longer a "Golden Score" - judo development rolling down a downward curve.
Jackevi<0xC4><0x87>, who consults the Kazakh judiciary here, and Vsevold Zeloni does not see the heirs.
But if we don’t grow, we won’t either.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
Because from another galaxy "Rita Panorama" echoed the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation Rio to win medals.
A flight far from reality.
In the evening we waited with impatience and concern for the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/<0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x9B>di<0xC5><0x86>s - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already "death" group - the losers of the game ended.
You can also use the following information to find out if you want to use this information in your browser.
The tension was further increased in the length of the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the wind of the card over the entire length of the match.
For the players, the gust of wind caused additional complications.
At first it seemed that it could be our ally, which is the most comprehensive.
But he didn't come.
It was quite easy to play against the Latvian duet here.
Serve so to Samoilov and wait for him to break.
In the end, the first set and the third start were broken against the Canadians, because the load was not on the bucket.
At the time, the smuggler could fish, because the work was small, but when it was done, it was done in honor.
In addition to this, it is important to note that there is a lack of transparency in the application of the rules and procedures for the application of the rules and regulations.
You can also lose by 0:2, because the second set deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind, managed to win.
The third one was already enthralled by the sign of Evans.
The chain was formed - the service was inconclusively recorded, the second inning often flew too close to the network, and Samoilov was left with very few options for a resulting attack.
If there was a foreigner Samoilov against the Cubans in the field, then this time he worked more successfully, and it would be unprofessional to inflict damage only on Sasha.
It is also a symbol of the fact that the last ball in the block was hit by him.
Losing the team.
In the third set, only two Evans attacks almost flew out of the card, but the ball still hit the line in the third set.
Two walks were next to the line.
Also controversial episodes video decision for the good of opponents.
If in the first two games Evandra fought with the serviettes, then against ours they were very productive.
All in all, the loss was on the table.
The reasons for the failure must now be analysed calmly.
Perhaps as many should have lived next to the stadium, not with a delegation to the Olympic village.
We spent two and a half hours on the road.
Perhaps a bit of self-confidence was given by a series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe you shouldn't have played in Kl<0xC3><0xA5>genfurt, but come here faster and get acclimatized better.
Maybe there was a mistake with finding the top of the sporty shape.
There are more questions than answers.
The game is over for our little ones.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments left, as well as "Masters" of Jurmala.
The smear with Samoilov has never been friends in life and will not be, because there are too different personalities.
But it is not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals has come true, there may also be an idea of a divorce, because guilt will be sought not only in yourself but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much harder to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the bait, but John and Tom have already tried and also made peace, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world’s peaks.
You can try Harald Regs, Aleksandr Solovej, Edgar Toc, to return to Martini Plavi<0xC5><0x86>a, but it will not be better than this option, which has not once proved itself in the stages of the World Cup.
Copacabana sand did not make them laugh this time.
A certain one.
Of course, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that beach volleyball becomes more popular, new couples enter the circulation, and only the rare growth is less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
We don't have any longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to get involved in the places offered by the organizers of the games, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have set up a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, for journalists who offered accommodation to all the neighbouring countries, the prices were strongly exaggerated.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes they can be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
This time, the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, apartments for rent on the border of Kopakabana and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 meters away, a half-hour walk from the main arena.
The area is quite safe, because the favelas pavilion, however, you should not lose alertness here too.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what he sometimes immediately imagines, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was realized on Friday morning.
In the 100-metre barrier run and high-speed skiing Laura Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>as has left her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of break "Porgijs and Besa" sounds in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgijs and Besa" was first studied at the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been re-enacted.
That is why the organizers of C<0xC4><0x93>su Art Festival and Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s masterpiece.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was last able to enjoy the performance of the opera, this great version of George Gershwin's "Porgi and Besa" opera concert studio is enjoyed at the "Bot<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0xBE>e" at the "Bot<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0xBE>e" concert in the new, newly-opened concert.
Opera "Porgijs and Besa" is a story told in bright musical language about love, its instability, passion, as well as the tragedies of family life and the simple pleasures of everyday life.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairis.
What I like the most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, lighting up one character or another personage, or choir, or orchestra.
"It is the most exciting, this construction", the opera is appreciated by the musical conductor and conductor of the concert studio of the opera "Porgijs and Besa" Andris Poga.
Visitors to the opera are unanimous that this is a grand event.
They are very pleased to hear the world-famous opera of Gershwin.
It’s a good thing that you can breathe the world in Liepaja.
"Performance professional", the opera is rated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special in that for the first time the orchestra played in the orchestral bed in the newly opened concert hall "The Big Dipper" and for the first time an opera concert took place.
The field near the restored building of the Art Museum could be named after Ja<0xC5><0x86>a Rozent<0xC4><0x81>l.
The Vice Mayor of Riga, Andris Ameriks, at the opening of the exhibition of the anniversary of Rozent<0xC4><0x81>la, announced that the museum’s own address in the future could not be Kri<0xC5><0xA1>ja<0xC5><0x86>a Valdem<0xC4><0x81>ra street 10a, but Ja<0xC5><0x86>a Rozent<0xC4><0x81>la square 1.
The director of the museum, M<0xC4><0x81>ra L<0xC4><0x81>ce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but overall this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga has a kind of foundation for this idea in 1936, creating a monument to Jan Rozent<0xC4><0x81>l, who stands at the museum.
William Purvitis, the then director of the museum, was one of the initiators of the construction of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I'm a little confused all the time - but William Purvitis, where are we going to put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think," said Lace.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art, after ambitious reconstruction and modernization, officially opened its doors in May this year.
This week, the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Palace will finally begin.
Drinks for about 11 million euros will be replaced by SIA "Velve".
It is planned to renovate several castle premises, including two spectators halls, as well as the building to accommodate people with mobility impairments.
The Riga Council intends to allocate six million euros of European Union funds to the project, but the Director of the Property Department of the Riga Council, O<0xC4><0xBC>egs Burovs, acknowledges that there is still no complete clarity on the European funds for the project.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start the renovation of the VEF Culture Castle by attracting the European Structural Funds, there is, for months we are waiting for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether it will be allocated money or not," says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that it all depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you make your own decision that Brussels does not make a decision here.
Now we see that another round of discussion is forming again, well, then we'll see what we can expect in the coming days.
“I want to say that the Riga Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines,” says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the immediate renovation of the building.
Although last year, the renovation of the building was still not started and the collective continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga Town Hall Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Cultural Castle is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Culture Castle and to improve the surrounding area.
It provides for the arrangement of the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as the restoration of the facade of the building.
Second - Improvement of the offer of services of the VEF Cultural Palace.
It plans to improve the studio of the interior of the building, the restoration of the walls and ceilings, the stage and sound recordings, as well as the arrangement of the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving the working conditions of creative amateurs’ collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, room heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu", the legendary rock band can be introduced at the exhibition in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
The exhibition will display various objects that characterize "Livus" - photographs, which are arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to the year 2010, when the end of the group's activities is announced.
The participants' costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert pieces will also be shown, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the wider public, which reflected the creative activity of the group "Livi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from the Liepaja Museum.
The exhibition’s visual design was made in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elite Patmalnieci.
Also, the musicians who had been associated with the group "Liv" and their relatives, responded to the invitation and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" are sought in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols, was created at the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Cultural House.
The ensemble took part in the festival "Liepajas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the sights of the city and the republic.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavitols met <0xC3><0x89>rike <0xC4><0xB6>ig<0xC4><0x97>li and founded a group in the Cultural Castle of Metallurgy, inviting Ingrid G<0xC5><0xAB>tmani, Andri Kr<0xC5><0xAB>zinu and J<0xC4><0x81>ni Grodumu to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to affirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see is not the smoke - jeans, hair and beards, these boys are feeling very different from the stereotype of the generally accepted performance gland," says music reviewer Klass V<0xC3><0xA5>vere.
The group has worked without the above mentioned musicians such excellent musicians as Igo, Vilnis Ruevi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Modris <0xC5><0xA0>terns, Valdis <0xC5><0xA0>tarks, Laimis R<0xC4><0x81>cen<0xC4><0x81>js, T<0xC4><0x81>lis Half-Barnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars <0xC4><0x81>nti Br<0xC4><0xAB>ze, Guntars Tocenieks, Dainis.
Entrance to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition can be viewed from 19 August to 30 October.
In turn, in the 27th of August Liepaja concert hall "P<0xC5><0xAB>t, v<0xC4><0x81>ji<0xC5><0x86>i" will be held the 40th anniversary celebration of the group "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" "L<0xC4><0xAB>VIfest 2".
For the first time in 8 months, inflation has been observed in Bulgaria.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed a 1% monthly inflation rate.
This is the highest figure since 2012 and the first figure above zero since last October, when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation after the PCI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016, compared to the previous year, was 101.9% and average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was a significant increase in prices for the following groups of goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural activities (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); housing equipment, household appliances and regular home care (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month's level for alcohol and tobacco, for management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s: The time is coming, and the truth is the way up.
In an interview with the Independent, the archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, Zbigniew Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s, emphasizes that if we want to gain strength in life, the Gospel message must be at its center.
For the power of truth is greater than the strength of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will the faithful there receive this year?
In recent years, the pope’s nuncio has expressed his desire to lead the main diocese in Aglona.
Therefore, the main content of the message is also in his mind.
It is also a kind of tradition that the way of the Cross is led by Bishop J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bulis.
He will also send his own message.
On the previous day, I conducted the Vigilian worship service.
Last year I addressed Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house covered in it, Earth theme in the Latvian context.
This year... of course, I've been watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach is consistent with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message should be placed at the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of human life and inspires him to take the next step forward.
Then it appeals to people.
But in C<0xC4><0x93>sis, in Lampas' discussion, you said that "we will return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person avoids the message of the church?
And does the church today have such a resource of return?
A man dies on the side of a road in the Indian capital.
In the Indian capital, no one has believed or heard of a man who died on the road - it turns out that he fell asleep on the roadside for an hour and was then overcrowded, reports BBC.
It has been reported that the man, who was identified as Matibul, rode a rickshaw during the day, but worked for the guard at night.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning walks home on the road when he is hit by a light car.
Surveillance camera footage shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour, when no one had seen a man bleed, a garnish surrounded him.
About 90 minutes after the incident, the police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died from the injuries suffered.
Referring to his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Kolegova, Head of the State Environment Service, saved the government from the fall, says Oj<0xC4><0x81>rs Skudra, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Kolegov's explanation of the revocation of the candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is related to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
Skudra, in conversation with the agency LETA, said that it was difficult for him to imagine that next week at the government meeting "Unity" would support Kolegov's candidacy.
Therefore, if the Ministers of "Unity" voted against, but Kolegov was approved in office anyway, it would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Danu Reisnieci-Ozola and the Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski.
At the same time, it was also acceding to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
In predicting whether to find a suitable candidate with the help of the competition, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be appointed or the institution as the CEO will continue to lead Dace in the Grey.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being considered, it would be a home for the Grey that he should not take part in the competition.
When you are in a relationship with someone else, you are in a relationship with them, and you are in a relationship with them.
In the case of the "Unity" objections, the government postponed Kolegov's approval for the post of Director General of the VID on Tuesday for a week.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that he was still ready to become the head of the VID.
However, it later changed its mind - in a submission to the Minister of Finance, Dana Reisniecei-Ozolai on Friday, she states that she is withdrawing her consent to transfer to the post of Head of the VID and that she has no easy choice.
The press secretary of the Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ra Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inska, Andrejs Vaivars, explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant position of Director General of the VID.
In the center of Riga there was an accident involving a police car.
In the center of Riga this afternoon there was a road traffic accident, in which the State Police car was involved.
The police car with the sound and light signals turned on rushed to the top category call, until it collided with another car at the intersection of K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a Baron and Dzirnavu Street.
The police explain the circumstances of the incident, but the initial information indicates that the second force did not launch the police car.
A woman was injured in an accident.
This year, the population of Riga has fallen
At the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital officially registered 641,000 inhabitants, the agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Administration (CSP).
In turn, in terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and major cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the data of the EU Statistical Office "Eurostat" in Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly ranked first among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe’s largest cities: 123 in Vilnius and 121 in Tallinn for every 100 men.
The warning pictogram will be placed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) - pictograms, Baiba Gailite, representative of the Property Department of the Riga Council, told the agency LETA.
At present, the repair of the glassed rapid damage of the museum, which had been caused as a result of the operation of the skateboard, has been successfully completed.
In the coming days, warning pictograms will be placed next to it.
Its inhabitants will be informed that the cover tends to be sliding rain and during snow, it is not allowed to move by cars, as well as to visit by bicycles, skateboards and skateboards.
On the above mentioned social network "Facebook" also wrote Ushakov at the time, who pointed out that no security threats damage, but "look inaccurate", and skateboarders "will be driven away".
Celebrations for children and parents- New children's playgrounds are set up in Riga.
This summer, the Riga Municipality has installed even two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalna, which are now available to children.
A wide, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, pipes and slides is installed on the beach of Gipsala.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
In the field also installed swings and various balancing elements.
The world of fantasy for small sailors is illuminated by the location of the attraction on the shores of Daugava with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there.
On the other hand, in the playground between the 4th and 5th intersections of <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalna, there is a playhouse, bats, a step track, a balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other elements of the game, as well as a gymnastics area with rings for strength and coordination exercises, etc.
Under the field, a rubber coating is coated in different colors.
Up to the playground on the side of the street is covered with a new, colorful bridge cover.
A reconstructed stage of the road has been discovered in Meduma.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC) management, as well as representatives of the builders SIA "Binders" and the municipality today discovered the reconstructed state main highway of the Russian border (Greb<0xC4><0x97>va).
Roads are a national business card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed stage on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that the co-financing of European Union funds improves the situation on national main roads.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for roads will be acquired as early as 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most heavily loaded highways in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia," Ulgrimba said.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
Construction works in the stage from Medim to the Lithuanian border (156.4.-163.05. km) started at the beginning of the year and this year they continued after a technological break.
Reconstruction costs are <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13.5 million (including VAT) co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road stage has been completely reconstructed and next year repairs will begin in the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils, with which the entire road from the Lithuanian border to even Daugavpils will be arranged," said the Chairman of the Board of the LVC.
The main roads of the country are the most heavily loaded, and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to carry out the replacement of the asphalt overlay every 7-9 years.
"This, of course, will require adequate funding, and all travellers with hopes will pay attention to the proposals developed by the expert group for the arrangement of the road financing system," Lange noted.
Within the project, road connections and lighting in the center of Medumu were arranged.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four phases large-scale restoration and large-scale refurbishment and refurbishment works, the road length profile has been aligned, which has hitherto been very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and the turnaround area for public transport has been reconstructed.
Previously, the roads had insufficient incapacity and the terrain relief was not transparent due to the mountain valleys, as well as the old road common relief.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the road stage from the Daugavpils city border to the reconstructed stage (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out different types of work on more than 1,100 kilometers of state road.
Information on all repairs planned in the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired results of weight loss, it is very important to choose the right combinations of foods," admits Lithuanian dietitian Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do during the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
The combination of thoughtful dietary products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also aim to promote various processes of the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination because it provides a long-lasting feeling of satiety and helps fight fats.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel fit.
A meal rich in cayenne peppers and proteins, such as poultry meat or protein cocktail, not only creates a feeling of satiety, but also reduces the appetite after large meals in the next meals.
This combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that cayenne peppers can help get rid of the fat deposits in the abdominal area.
Eggs contain a metabolism-promoting nutrient - choline, while pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
By taking a sufficient amount of this nutrient, you can reduce your cortisol levels, as well as the accumulation of fat around the middle part of your body.
Autumn foliage, which is accompanied by fresh berries, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Egg leaves and berries contain fibers that, according to Canadian scientists, control ghrelin - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus also the feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which aid in weight loss and also prevent the formation of fats.
Vegetables and proteins also have the ability to perform miracles in weight loss.
Such a combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, therefore promotes a feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a sense of satiety for a longer period of time.
At lunch you can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from the ready-made mixture and enjoy it along with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch found in vegetables is polysaccharide.
Fruits are broken down in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not break down until they reach the third or fourth stage in the digestive process that takes place in the intestines.
You will be divided into three different stages, which begin in your mouth.
Therefore, it is essential not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating a sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "freezing" in the stomach along with other foods, where it is not chemically digested and begins to urinate.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products together with lemons, lemons, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other sour fruits.
The enzyme ptialine, which is located in the sediments, works only in the alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
To process them, a variety of digestive juices are required, each of them with different strengths, characteristics and the time when it is necessary to reach the stomach.
Strawberry, medusmelone, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are found in the stomach together with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with solids, however the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid consuming fat altogether.
This also applies to refreshment - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (contains protein) with whole avocado (contains fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight loss.
How to cook better?
"Cooking food, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the product's initial nutrient composition," notes a dietitian.
In most cases, nutrients go into loss by boiling food in water.
However, the value of some food nutrients increases by cooking directly.
After cooking vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook the vegetables, also by steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in the composition of tomatoes.
When boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins in them, making them easier to digest.
Similarly, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals in this product more easily absorbed in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while the freezing of fiber does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-blooding iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products than bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and poultry.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blooding iron in the body by taking dietary non-blooding iron-containing products along with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blooding iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen retention in the muscles and brains.
To get the most out of the salads, add them wholesome fats, such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing butter with salmon, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines-free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine, and it plays an essential role in the process of bone formation.
Eggs (as well as other whole-grain products) along with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, oats, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilize cholesterol levels as well as avoid arterial obstruction.
Snapchat criticises the effect of "Anime" on Asian caricature
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality in a completely absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit into the painting of Roja Liechtenstein.
Lenses are nebulous, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million converted selfies a day.
Any error quickly becomes publically noticeable.
The effects of Snapchat lenses have already been criticised in the past, with concerns that the app promotes too blackened or light facial skin tones as a benchmark for ideal beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to create smooth eyes, smooth teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian caricature – “yellow genes”.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denials broke out on Wednesday when the editions of The Verge and Motherboard announced that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to depict Anime images, not to caricature people of Asian origin.
However, in people who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the resemblance to Anime.
Korean-born American art student Greis Sparapani's Twitter entry on the images gained wide resonance. In an email she notes that the lens effects are "sad and uncomfortable to say no more".
She added that it is difficult not to notice the visible similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This shows that the effect of the lens is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has entered these cultural latitudes.
American culture is also involved in the never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use in our everyday lives.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing different races, unlike the older populations, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "today such things don't go unnoticed," 25-year-old Keith Zhou said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, Product Manager at Medium, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and in a telephone interview, she explained that she believes racial problems are caused by Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with the reference <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, therefore, such decisions are allowed. Whether the company employs some representatives of other races, but they do not take a position so that they can express their opinion safely and comfortably," says Zhou, an American of Chinese origin.
She also agrees with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origins of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has hired a staff specialist who will focus on also representing racial minorities in the company, who are not widely represented and will promote inclusion in the company.
In turn, Zhou will not update his Snapchat account, adding: "Interestingly, do they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right."
The Congressional Chamber declares that military officials have altered the reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Representatives of the U.S. Central Command noted that the reports distorted the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it actually is.
Analysts of the Central Intelligence Agency express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defence Financing in the wake of the Ismama a.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report reports that the intelligence services, confirmed by the top-ranking Centcom leaders, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts were regularly distorted, depicting better achievements.
California Republican Representative Kens Calvert says, "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our troops are the ones who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are sought by organizations in the highest management.
This 10-page report illustrates in detail the existing problems in the Central Command’s reflection and analysis of the American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide irrefutable evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration would have been able to distort the reports, it does indicate that the Centcom administration has put some pressure on analysts to portray ISIL as an optimistic view of the Islamic State.
The report states that in the first half of 2015, the press releases, announcements and reports of the Central Administration to Congress represented the situation in a much more positive light than it actually was.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, Republican Party Representative Mike Pompeo said: "The months-long investigation clearly confirms this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top officials in the U.S. Central Administration distorted reports, depicting ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party has set up a working group on the news that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Centcom Intelligence Service.
Members of the Board of Directors of the Democratic Party published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the working group of the Republican Party.
In his report, Democratic Representative Adams B. Shifs said that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr <0xC5><0xA0>if explains that this process "stops the dissemination of information", worsens the work ethic of analysts and "disseminates facts that are inconsistent with the truth."
But Shif and members of the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports in line with "pre-determined or political position".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s General Inspectorate had launched an investigation into complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report until further investigations were carried out.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Administration called for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year’s indictment casts doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence recalls the more than a decade-old events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hookers published the study, claiming that the Bush administration had started the war in Afghanistan, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Huker also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, officials reported that the Huker team discovered that, contrary to public reports, the airstrikes of the Islamic State oil plants did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group in the tsunami, as they had been building.
The September issue of The Times reported that the discovery did not take place outside the walls of the Central Administration.
At the time, the commander of Centcom, General Lloyd Ostin III, received acute criticism, as many lawmakers considered that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Ostin took a vacation and General Joseph L. Votel took his place.
In the United States, in a duel with the United Kingdom in women's field hockey, the United States wins, thus achieving a fourth victory in a row.
The day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday Keitiya Bama won the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans beat the Indian team with a score of 3-0.
Five goal gains in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said that she could not remember what she would have ever done.
She said, "I don't feel."
I’m not one of those people who counts their goals.
But she knows that the result of the Americans in the Olympic Games is 4:0, which gives them in their group an indistinguishable with the United Kingdom, which on Thursday after the victory over Japan with a score of 2:0 remained undefeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round of games.
Both teams are already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will only determine which team will take first place in the group of six teams and which will be second.
The winner of the first place will avoid meeting with a strong Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group for a little longer.
Although the Saturday game has not closed, the Americans have already called a surprise storm, four years ago in London, taking the last place among the 12 teams.
It's the same with Bama.
She grew up in Bluebell, took the field hockey bat for the first time in her hands when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national selection when she was 16 years old, becoming a young player.
She did not participate in the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not enter the finals.
However, 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
In the following year, England’s Kreg Parham was appointed as the lead coach and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London, we didn’t do as much work as we do now.
We've completely changed everything.
On Thursday in the game Bama revealed the result, scoring the goals in the first half with a rear shot from a close distance.
India started the game without a win in their account, but their selection was very lively and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama won again.
She put the ball in the opponent's zone on the left side of the field, then noticed getting to the middle of the field and sending the ball to the opponent's gates, pushing the American 2-0 lead.
In the middle of the fourth period Melisa Gonzales won another goal.
This was the first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Brigge's dry game, each of the first three games to be scored by one goal.
She's got a confession.
And so is Bama.
"We're doing very well right now," said Pahams, but how well exactly, the game will show on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is "Satisfied food"
In March 1933, shortly after the election to the post of President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in an oval room to hold a meal.
President Roosevelt tasted such fine culinary delicacies as the liver paste of the gums in the soup of the sea turtles of Maryland.
But then his meal was much more modest: eggs filled with tomato sauce, potato chips and dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelman says, "It's a way of solidarity in cooking with people who were on board very hard."
Her husband, Andrew Cow, adds, "It's also a message for Americans, how they should eat."
A couple in the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
Kou in the last book "Vegetable Sautation" described Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman in his book "97 Apples" describes life through food rental in a house in the lower eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Satisfied Food," published Tuesday by Harper Publishing House, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in the culinary, they held a meal together with reporters at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple luncheon located in the Flatiron area and operating since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
The 54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered butter with smashed cheese and chopped olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered turkeys, potatoes and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered a fake rabbit, the couple recognized that his choice was very appropriate to the conversation about the food of the Great Depression.
Mrs Ziegelmane said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was a potato rabbit, a liver rabbit and a bean rabbit.
They were made from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the food.
Imagine what it is like - eat so many strawberries that they are in place for lunch.
Mr. Kou resigned.
"It probably seemed that the stomach was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American lunch table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
The women were preparing to eat their men-workers, and at breakfast, lunches and dinners freshly prepared pastries were served.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food directly to Europeans. "Sappy food" is described as how Americans adapted to the conditions when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"Food became the main focus of the American people's everyday life," Mr. Kou said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this topic.
Just as important became the new budget diets: such unknown foods as fake rabbits and shakes became everyday, shakes were "a great way to use excesses," noted Ms. Ziegelmane, as cooks could hide unattractive ingredients.
Fresh fruits were replaced by inexpensive dried fruits.
Meat, which has been a major ingredient in American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of the food were more important than the taste, gender new, yet unseen formations.
In an old cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelman found a recipe for cooking onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It wasn't a popular lunch table supplement."
Ms. Ziegelman points out: "It was real."
Peanut butter and roasted onion are not compatible.
Many home-cooked recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined state eating habits that were not experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that households become "economists" and accept challenges such as turning pasta and carrot mix into a tasty meal.
"Sati<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0x81> M<0xC4><0xAB>t<0xC4><0xAB>te" is a sweet taste of historical delicacies.
Particularly interesting is the testimony of the government's attitude towards its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Huver's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and eating in Aiowa, in fact, he ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr. Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost gilded living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely obsessed with reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleonora, had not recommended him to show an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who did not teach him how to cook, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most delicious dishes in Washington was served, but also the worst cooked dishes".
As soon as the national economy recovers, most of the culinary customs of the Depression era are gone.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science in culinary, added Mrs Ziegelman.
The couple recounts that, when writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," Mr. Kou said.
Ms. Ziegelman said, "She was actually stalking people."
Once upon a time there was an incident with wind cakes.
When we ate at Eisenberg’s restaurant, a couple of writers pulled out of a bag of home-made desserts: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"It's plum pudding," said Ms. Ziegelman, adding that at the time it was a common custom to give modest food a chic name.
It does not contain foam, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All impatiently soaked the spoon in the brown mass found on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t as bad.
Mr Kou eats a few more cucumbers.
Listening to an experienced "economist," he said to his wife, "I'd like to eat a pineapple minced hazelnut."
Gilead Will Receive Reimbursement for Legal Expenses in Fighting Merck for Hepatitis C Patent
The district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover the costs of legal services paid by it in the case of the patent infringement of Hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was fined <0xC2><0xA3>200 million for breaching two Merck patents, which threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a U.S. federal judge found violations in Merk's actions, such as lying after a misdemeanor and swearing.
In a hearing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labsons Fr<0xC3><0xAD>mens stated that Gilead is entitled to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in defending the case.
Merck is trying to gain market positions against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C drugs, which are 90% effective in cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of the Gilead medicinal product.
U.S.-backed forces claim to have completely taken control of the city of Manbij from Islamic State.
U.S.-backed forces have completely taken control of the city of Manbij in the northern part of the country near the Turkish border and the last Islamic State troops have left the city, a group representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) is now clearing the city of the last enemy soldiers who have not yet left the city.
They have liberated more than 2,000 hostage-civilians who had been captured by the militants, Sharfan Darvish of the SDS-aligned Manbij military council told Reuters.
"The city is currently in complete control of us and we are conducting a search for fighters," he told Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton’s income reached $10.75 million and the couple paid a 34.2% federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released a 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2%, respectively.
During 2015, the Clintons have donated $1 million, mainly to their Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, while acting as a spokesperson and a former secretary of state, who worked as a chef, won $3 million in public relations.
U.S. Senator Tim Kane and his wife Anna Holtone have released their tax returns for the past 10 years, according to a press release.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Keynes continue to set new standards for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hides behind various injunctions and objections so that he doesn’t have to keep his promises to disclose his tax information.
Disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers mention an audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your turn," in his Twitter account, about the Democratic Party candidate's tax information was announced by Clinton campaign partner Ians Sams.
Trump's special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until the audit is completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitch Romney and other Republicans, claim that his resignation raises questions about the amount of his real estate, the amount of donations and other commitments he has made to his business, including Kris.
Clinton was burning oil on Friday, posting a video in which several influential Republicans demanded that Trump release his tax information.
She returned to the issue again during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She announced to the crowd: "He will refuse to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for several decades."
Politico reports that during the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no taxes at all, and the New York Times business column’s author reported on Friday that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today either.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Warren Buffett’s proposal, popularizes the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
During Clinton’s speech last week in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett urged Trump to exchange tax returns.
Bafett said that he is also being audited by the Revenue Service and Trump is afraid of voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax information until 2007.
Clinton now lives in Chappaque, New York and has paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 percent and a total tax rate of around 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises hotel in Berlin for unlocking the Israeli telephone code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The director of the French-born film of Jewish origin stormed social media when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code, which hotel staff base on the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, the director of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", does not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin hotel "Kempinski Bristol" and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lancman tried to find the Israeli dial-up code on the hotel list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was wiped out and destroyed?
Write Lancmans.
Instead of Kempinski Bristol, the hotel offers a call to this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the response received was "shocked by him".
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a conscious decision by the management of the hotel".
The reason for the removal of the code made the film director even more angry.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted a hotel employee as saying.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jakovs Hadas-Handelsman, has called the case a "big mess".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
The same in itself is a big shame.
And the fact that this has happened right in Germany, right in this hotel network there is an even greater humiliation.
There is no need for explanations.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also received quite a broad resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel was simply an arab shopper.
Another record reported "shame", indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
The Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all objections, announcing that it was all a "translation" and apologizing to Lancman.
“We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the country number list,” Kempinski said in a statement.
And add that the code was added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The clash between students and police took place on Thursday in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms of the government education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to expel students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to demonstrate their dislike for the reforms of the education system.
The proposal of the Governor of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmina, envisages the closure of nearly 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be relocated to other schools in order to save money.
Some demonstrators painted graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
This protest took place just days after the previous protest, when students gathered at demonstrations with the aim of expressing support for the deposed President Dilma Rousef, whose impeachment was voted on by the Senate.
Scott Kelums Skiners finishes first, bringing the United Kingdom a gold medal in cycling
Kelum Skiners from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team to compete in a sprint race at the Rio Velodrome that took place last night. The British team defended their championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
A 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making legendary Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy proud and giving away the win to New Zealand favourites.
In the past four years, the United Kingdom won an astonishing victory when Hoyt won his fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, although Hoy had already finished his sporting career.
The problems were in the stage between Beijing and the London Olympics, as they had to replace experienced start-up specialist Jamie Stafu.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, his place was trying to fill Kians Emadi and Mets Krampton.
The UK coach put hopes on Skinner, seeing in him the potential, which he later also proved.
India, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoy and Skinner, who set the Olympic qualification record, but the best start of the race was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Indians, by their own circle, were in a tight trench, Kenya took the lead, and Skinner guarded the lead.
The change in strategy played an important role in the victory, as the Indians drove with greater gear to allow Kenya and Skinner in particular to drive faster.
Hoyt watched the race as a BBC representative and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenya and Hindes at the moment when they climbed to the pedestal of honour.
The 23-year-old glacier said, "That was an indescribable compliment."
I do everything I can to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and won the World Champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better win.
After winning with Kenya and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, the Indians admitted to deliberately falling onto the track after a failed start.
He later rejected this comment and was unable to prove the opposite to British competitors.
This time there was no such incident.
The Hindus said: "British flags in the tribals recalled London in memory."
In the last 3 months, we have become a combined team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory at the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal in the race for the country, which won seven out of ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya’s performance, he could indeed repeat Hoya’s success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
It would mean six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenya. Moreover, Kenya was born on March 23 (it appears to be a British holy day, as on this day Steve Regreve, Mo Farahs and Roger Bannisters were born as well).
What is the best way to do this?
Kenya’s next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "At the moment, I'm just enjoying it.
The team’s journey is always the best.
Because then you can win together with team members.
If you’re honest, winning one is a little lonely.”
Hindus said: "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be promoted to the rank of gunman."
It was the only fight for medals that day, but it was not the only good news for the United Kingdom.
Sir Bradley Viggins, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke and Ovein Douls showed the fastest qualifying time in the four-kilometre race.
Their time was 3:51,943
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Viggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
Yesterday before the qualifying trip he was inconsistent with the commissionership when the judges called him to measure his growth.
In the women’s journey that will continue and end today, Laura Trot, Joanna Rovsell Shanda, Elinor Barker and Keith Archibald from Milngawie set a new record time of 4:13,260.
The UK delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hoping to win medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented achievements in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio as well.
In the meantime, the technical director Shane Satton has stepped down on various backgrounds, after accusations of sexism and disrespect, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton have also ended their careers.
However, starting with the first velodrome races, it seems that as always the UK will reach the highest level in a timely manner.
The future of the Portland gas station is becoming unclear as an ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of aluminum mills and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear, as its main customer the energy company has announced the termination of the cooperation.
This Communication is based on the plans of the Government of Victoria to discontinue the subsidisation of the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidy will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2,000 jobs, both direct and indirect, could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as cassette consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry depot, which led to the discontinuation of the Anglesea power plant.
The Portland Alcove works with losses and can be closed.
These events were triggered by several years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The plant’s energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroube Valley, says that the other three owners are also likely to terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertakings, in addition to the company's shares also by Chinese holding companies CITIC and Japan Marubeni Corp.
AGL expects to continue its operations at the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply to the quarry," the representative said.
AGL announced that the contracts are so-called ‘risk-limiting contracts’, which are scheduled to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
ATL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the representative of the company.
As from the 2018 fiscal year, the potential impact on profits will be limited by favourable market forecasts for electricity wholesale prices in the future.
AGL claims that in its forecasts, it has already calculated losses of $ 187 million , predicting that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa notes that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue the operation of the plant or to supply it with energy.
The U.S. company announced that it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, but it would be terminated in November. The company does not provide an explanation as to why it would terminate its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns both about the possible closure of the Portland gas station in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the sector.
ACL CEO Stevens Michaelson said last week that analysts estimate that 600 megawatts of energy and 900 megawatts of Tomago energy will be used during the year in Portland.
If both of these factories were to leave the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people each year.
More than 160,000 people’s demands are rejected each year, and a reduction in the budget could worsen the situation.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal expulsion - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that if funding is reduced, the situation will only get worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
In the case of the case-law of the Court of First Instance, the Court of First Instance of the Court of First Instance of the Court of First Instance of the Court of First Instance of the Court of First Instance of the Court of First Instance of the Court of First Instance of the Court of First Instance.
Mr Farels pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, then the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland Legal Center is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is refused to the thousands of people who need it."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who experience divorce, workers who are unfairly fired - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary compensation.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand more citizens of Queensland will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately halt the cut in funding so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government announced its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also pay attention to the needs of the local communities and their customers and to invest in this important area for the Palazcuk government.
Donald Trump’s campaign indicted in court because one of the employees pulled a gun
New York: The organizers of Donald Trump’s campaign have been charged in court for not acting on the news that their North Carolina operation chief had turned a gun on an employee when they were driving in a car in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer, on Wednesday in Charlotte's court.
Bordini said that he has been waiting for months that the internal review of this matter will begin, but understand that it will not happen.
“He pulled out his gun, put his right index finger on the knife and turned the stick against Vincent’s end,” Bordini said in his complaint.
He also claims that when submitting a complaint to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
“Weapons don’t have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said in his complaint.
Only two days before the submission of this case, the Republican Party candidate for the post of president caused a scandal, notifying people that "the people of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners and enthusiasts of the guns, could act in the event of the ti<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>s<0xC4><0x81>n and the Kl<0xC4><0xAB>t<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0xAB>s<0xC4><0xAB>s<0xC4><0xAB>s<0xC4><0xAB> victory.
Trump’s campaign representatives announced that the media had ripped his words out of context, and he had never stabbed anyone to violence.
Bordini with his claim wants to claim compensation from the organizers of the campaign for negligent surveillance, but from Filips - for the attack, the illegal use of weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
What is the best way to do this?
I couldn't get in touch with Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently abandoned the campaign.
Also, it was not possible to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".

A new tradition - a festival of horse riding and sports in K<0xC5><0xAB>lciem.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered in K<0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0xBC>kiem for the festivals of pasta and sports.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided this time that the Feast of the Sea would no longer be held.
The new page has now been redirected.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in the traditional ways and too seriously taken, because, for example, shots had to be thrown at the sleeping target, the boot flew, with the human left hand cast, the "bubbles" have not been at all in any Olympic games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, skillful and caring he is.
After the sporting games, everyone gathered in the outdoors show, where the festival of Padesta began.
During that time, the "children's corner" also worked, where the little ones could blow out in inflatable attractions and get a new image in the make-up shop.
A novelty that could also become a tradition was the display of vehicles, in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
All were addressed by Inga Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>e-Skadi<0xC5><0x86>a, the head of the administration of K<0xC5><0xAB>lciem parish, who wanted a nice rest and dry time, but the rain was still pouring, but it was not able to disturb much.
The celebrations continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB>lciem.
It's really good that the farmhouse has been supplemented by five girls and one guy.
With the performances at the guilds had come amateur art collectives from Engure novad - spectators very much liked the senior dance group "Rudens rhythm", various dance performers "Reds" and youth dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it's nothing that someone happened to slip on the wet stage too.
Of course, the local people and villagers were delighted by the famous actors duo J<0xC4><0x81>nis Jar<0xC4><0x81>ns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildi<0xC5><0x86>a Nabi<0xC5><0x86>a and Skaidr<0xC4><0xAB>te Kr<0xC4><0x81>ni<0xC5><0x86>a, as well as the attractive wives of B<0xC4><0x93>rzciema from the fishermen's farm "Dien<0xC4><0x97>".
Balli was played by the group "Brugis".
The United Kingdom must maintain the Olympic spirit and enlarge the territory of Heathrow.
It will not only promote prosperity and growth in the local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hitros very attractive, just as we did in 2012 in London, where we put in a huge amount of work for all regions of the country to be the winners of the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Irene won a huge amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities close to the city of Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs, and finally we will set a point for youth unemployment in the Hitrova area.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, this time there will be people who will think that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global extinction.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012, and in the case of Hitrov, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitrova has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrova is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole of society, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion, creating a ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
In Hitrov works an excellent team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, including in time and budget, starting with Terminal 5, which five years from the site has been named as the best airport terminal in the world for use at the end of the day, and ending with Terminal 2.
They are now ready to create a third runway, which will be financed by private investments of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that the expansion of the city of Heathrow will be the same.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and enlarge Haiti by securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.

In Switzerland, a woman rushes to the highway, trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, we walked on the highway.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when she was hit by several cars early on Thursday morning on the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in the canton of Vo.
A report by the Wo Canton Police said that in a desperate attempt to commit suicide, the woman had stumbled onto the road in the dark, where she was picked up by several cars.
In an effort to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss man, drove several cars, including a heavy machine.
He died at the scene.
A number of drivers involved in the accident have already testified, but others involved have not yet been identified, says the police, which calls for the recall of the drivers involved and witnesses to the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been initiated in the case, which in this case is a logical step, the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers announced for Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers adds, "That's the plaintiffs."
Two similar incidents that have occurred in the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian was on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that the drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was convicted of being killed in a car accident in August 2014 by a man who was lying on the A1 road in the middle of the night near Pijernes.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policeman, who was on his way to the scene of the accident, was driving in an appropriate manner and the judge acknowledged that the sleeping man on the road was a "completely unpredictable and extraordinary incident".
Anyone who has information about Thursday's accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, we collect signatures for the holding of a new tender for the position of head of the VID.
On the petition portal "Avaaz.org" started the collection of signatures for the holding of the tender of the new Head of State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens and Farmers’ Union (ZZS) states that the society wants a transparent and professional process of appointing officials.
The petition was created on August 10th, and it is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of appointing Ingas Kolegov, the applicant for the post of Director General of the VID, is opaque and unprofessional.
It recalls the best traditions of officials of the Soviet Union.
This discredits public administration and, once again, causes society to despair of government and politicians.
"We need a call for tenders with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed," the petition said.
Its author J<0xC4><0x81>nis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for how Kolegov was elected to a position.
It is also unclear what the candidate’s intentions are in the VID.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should create a new, open competition, in which professional candidates are actively interviewed, staffing specialists are involved and an appropriate remuneration is offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reisnieces-Ozola formally promoted Kolegov to the post of head of the VID last week, this week the government was planning to approve him in the new post, but all the "Unity" ministers of the party voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played poorly.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandr Samoilovs and J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> hoped for an award at the Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro Olympic Games, however, without reaching it, there is no difference in where to close the competition, after leaving the tournament expressed Samoilovs.
One of the strongest beach volleyball pairs in the world on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the subgroup tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to Brazilians Evandra Gonsalves in Oliveira and Pedru Solbergi<0xC4><0x87> in Salgada.
In the three subgroup matches, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same relationship was for two more pairs.
In the continuation, the ratio of the three pairs of small points was counted, which was the most favorable for the Latvian duet after the hardest convincing loss in this match.
In the first set we were in control, but from 16:15 we also stayed on 16 points," <0xC5><0xA0>medi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> recalled the course of the game.
I don't even know how the rest of the set leaves me with no points.
You can't play it.
After that, in the second set everything was in order and in the end of the set managed to break the game, in addition, it should be a good basis for the third set as well.
We started it similarly, but after we switched sides, the result grows only for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so small points were important.
"You should have played more similarly, rather than scoring 3-4 points in a row several times," said the athlete.
We knew that Evandra could be served.
"In the first set we came up with it, in the second we scored 1-2 points, but in the third at <0x2B>4 he already left the game," <0xC5><0xA0>medi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> recalled.
We tried to show the best game.
Moments came, moments didn’t.
I did not see the situation before the match, but it was known that as few points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, then I played badly," said Samoilov.
We expected good service from Evans, and the first set was also pretty good, but the third set was open to him and it was difficult to form an attack.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes in taking the service directly to Peter, but it had to be done.
You will be able to find a way to improve the quality of your life, and you will be able to find a way to improve your health.
"We won, we played, we also had a defense, but we needed a better reception of service," said the athlete.
"They played well and in the end they got to the clock."
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw was the most uncomfortable that could have been.
We also had the chance to fight for first place, but we did not even get out of the group.
"All of us expected a medal and also we from ourselves, but then there is no difference - 25th or fourth place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilova Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aniro was already in his third Olympic career, since in 2008 he started in Beijing with Martini P<0xC5><0x82>avi<0xC5><0x86>a, but four years ago he played in London with Ruslan Sorokin.
In the meantime, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86>a was the second start in the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from both the position of the consumer and the potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether to join the Latvian gas market in the future, as a trader, will determine what model of the gas market and legal framework will be created."
"Therefore, on our part, we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislative acts, as well as presenting our proposals," Bidere said.
The Agency of BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economy (EM) in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas G<0xC3><0xA1>ze" has developed the draft Cabinet Regulations "Regulations on natural gas trade and use in the natural gas field" which will change the principles of natural gas production in the natural gas field.
When working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of the EM is to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and convenient service solution for the user, the "trader's central model" is chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice in a customer's account and one information in a customer's account.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the field of electricity trade.
We remind that the gradual opening of the market is intended for household users - even after 3 April 2017 those household users, who do not want to choose another natural gas dealer, will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing retailer on their premises.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to connected users at a regulated price is fixed to the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, traders will have to choose a natural gas dealer with whom to conclude a contract for the trade in natural gas.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, a certain period of time for traders to trade natural gas will be provided by the present natural gas trader at its fixed price.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the procedure for the placement of landfills for landfills for the users of natural gas, the safe use requirements of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the landfills for landfills for landfills for landfills, the rights and obligations of landfills for landfills for landfills for landfills for landfills,

Minister: Next week it is planned to decide on an increase in the salary of the Director-General of the VID.
Minister of Finance Dana Reisniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers’ Union (ZZS)) next week plans to talk with Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski (ZZS) and government coalition partners about the salary of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
In the case of the EFTA Surveillance Authority, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (EFSA) is responsible for ensuring that the EFTA Surveillance Authority (EFSA) is responsible for the implementation of the EFTA Surveillance Authority.
We also talked about a change in the terms of the competition next week.
The Minister also stressed that she does not have a specific candidate to speak for a vacant position.
At the same time, Reisniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that Inga Kolegov, Head of the State Environment Service, would have been a good Director General of the VID.
However, with regard to Daci Pel<0xC4><0x97>ko, the current head of the VID, who has expressed his willingness to qualify for this position, the Minister reiterated the view that the new VID Director-General should be "looking from the edge" and should not come from the VID structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the return of the Saeima from the holiday in order to move as soon as possible the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganization of the VID.
The Agency BNS has already announced that the Head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolegova, has submitted a proposal to the Minister of Finance, Dani Reisniecei-Ozola (ZZS), in which he withdraws his candidacy for the post of Director General of the VID.
In the submission, she said that it was not an easy choice, but in the last two weeks her relatives have experienced serious emotional pressure, even though they have not done anything that is condemned by the law.
In addition, Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which are also unacceptable.
It is also reported that the former Director General of the VID, In<0xC4><0x81>ra P<0xC4><0x93>tersone, left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock market indices in the US and Europe, as well as the value of the US dollar, are rising.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, positively influencing investors’ attitudes to the statements of the Saudi Arabian oil minister, which reinforces the expectation that the largest oil-conquering countries will achieve a stable tenure at the forthcoming OPEC meeting in September.
The three main U.S. stock indexes on Thursday reached a record high that had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in the price of oil and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and strong financial indicators of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in European stock indexes.
The value of the US dollar rose on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
In the e-commerce of the New York Stock Exchange, the price of the WTI brand’s crude oil supplies rose by 1.78 USD on Thursday to $43.49 per barrel.
The price of Brent crude oil on the London Stock Exchange rose by $1.99 in October to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of the canned producer "Zil<0xC4><0x81> lag<0xC5><0xAB>na" plummets by 33.8%.
Canned producer "Blue Lagoon" pern turnover was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual resoft database.
The report of the management of the company states that in 2015 the company was working with losses caused by a number of reasons, including due to a permanent lack of circulating funds, which was caused by the failure of "Unicred Bank" to break them out of the Baltic market.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a reduction in the volume.
The withdrawal of the bank in question from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing EU Structural Fund support projects that would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
Similarly, in the previous year, the financial creators of the company were adversely affected by the rise in the prices of raw materials and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the products produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized the price changes and were ready to buy the goods at new - the highest - prices", says the management of the company.
In 2015, the Blue Lagoon began negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's movable and real estate.
Investors have already been to the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have introduced and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes that allow for greater production productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"Several equipment has been purchased, which ensures a higher production speed," said the management of the company.
The management of the "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's factory to execute orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since intentional protocols for the sale of the product have already been signed, everything produced will be sold in accordance with intentional protocols.
The new product will increase the turnover by around 300,000 euros per month", says the management of the company.
In August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq.
In 2016, the Blue Lagoon sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the sales market to Cyprus, and in September this year it will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the US.
As a result of all the above measures, the company intends to increase turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Lagoon worked with a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,347 million and losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,113 million.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a capital of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals - Mihai Kaidanova (89,11%) and Igor <0xC5><0xA0>ir<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xB3>n (10.89%).
You are welcome to meet the bizarre Z<0xC4><0x81>ra Leanderi at the museum at 15 p.m. and attend a press conference.
Riga can be regarded as the city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the venerated cinematographer Zara Leander.
Z<0xC4><0x81>ras Leander’s village near the cross mother Rutas, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was a fateful one in Riga in 1924, because she revealed to the woman of Z<0xC4><0x81>ras Leanderes an unusual low contract, which she tried while making her debut at the R<0xC4><0xAB>gas Kabar<0xC4><0x97>te.
Perhaps it was just a coincidence in Riga that became a fateful turning point in the creative journey of the Saras against the world’s fame.
R<0xC4><0xAB>ga Z<0xC4><0x81>ra Leanderi was connected with warm memories, and she hoped to return to Riga on the road trips, but unfortunately these hopes were not decided to be fulfilled, because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and the great Ieva Ker<0xC4><0x93>vica will feel in the role of the outstanding Z<0xC4><0x81>ras Leanderes.
In the area of Aglona there are wide traffic restrictions.

The insurer pays compensation to passengers cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If the insurance company paid a travel insurance fee to a family for the flight cancelled on Wednesday, August 10 at the airport "Riga", which caused them to refuse to visit the intended music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance received a claim for reimbursement from a client.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, however, because it was not possible due to the cancellation of flights at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was charged a fee for the booking of accommodation, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the purchased 20 festivals.
In turn, the airline has promised to reimburse customers for the money spent on airfare tickets.
If Insurance out of all travel insurance reimbursements an average of 15% of the cases have paid compensation for the cancellation or cancellation of the trip.
"This time, the expenses for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets are reimbursed, as well as for the reservation of accommodation," says Dagnija Rutka, Head of Insurance Product for Insurance Persons.
As you know, on the evening of August 10, a private plane stopped at the Riga airport due to technical problems of the runway, so only several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.
Due to the repair of the neighbor, the man is at the crumbling ceiling and forced to leave the house.
In the LTV broadcast "4th studio" was directed by Dmitry Saidyashev, whose neighbor began the capital repair in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been drenched from the ceiling and there is no certainty that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors did arbitrarily construction and my apartment has a damaged ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the house managers and other organizations.
The Government said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any experts.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineers' Union, and from there will be some expert," says Dmitrys.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what had happened and admitted that the cover was in a dissatisfaction.
However, since Dmitry’s first application to the construction board, a month has passed, and until the beginning of this week, no one has been able to answer whether being in the apartment is life-threatening.
The building board said - that's the legislation, wait, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the council of Riga, but they passed the house to the manager, then the manager of the house back to the building board, and then there is the road," says Dmitrys.
After looking at all the paper piles, it is clear that construction works have been suspended, although at some point you can hear that someone is working there.
Within two more months, the examination had to be carried out and within six months, the owner of the apartment, who is doing repairs, all these defects had to be repaired.
The opinion has been drawn up by an independent expert, but the Board of Directors considers it to be incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grating in this supporting structure has been affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
“That is why we have asked for further clarification from this expert,” says Ilze <0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xAB>ka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the prohibition to carry out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there it is always heard that the construction will continue.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in this case the penalty can be much higher.
While waiting for the expert opinion, the construction board decided that both apartments should not be operated - both where the construction works and Dmitry's apartment take place.
"This is an unfortunate case in the practice of the construction board, when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, the population may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner is not able to exploit his property",
Now Dmitry is left to look for another place to live - by radio, friends, hotel or rent another apartment.
But the damage caused by Dmitry can try to recover from his neighbor in a civil order, which can take a lot of time.
Due to voluntary construction, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his conclusion, and it may have to wait up to three weeks.
The damages will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment in which the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment due to the fact that the construction board has not taken into account, also threatened with imprisonment for up to six months.

The transformation of the former Khemer sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" will cost 22 million euros, the representative of the upcoming hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" Gita <0xC5><0xBD>elve tells the agency LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the restoration of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium.
The second phase will be the wellness clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
The turtle notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Khemer resort polyclinic, which has an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri and the intended clinic is the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest money in this fund, says <0xC5><0xBD>elve.
As George Jones, Executive Director of G Capital Europe, said earlier, 12 to 15 million euros are planned to be invested in the establishment of the former resort polyclinic, totalling more than 30 million euros.
It has already been announced that in the area of more than 42 hectares of the cultural historical park, in the area of the refurbishment of the roads and streets, in the construction of an interactive natural tourism facility, in the maintenance of the territory and in the construction of a parking lot in the village of <0xC4><0x8C>emi<0xC4><0x81>la D<0xC4><0x81>rzi<0xC5><0x86>a, in the village of J<0xC4><0xAB>r<0xC4><0xAB>ma<0xC5><0xAB>.
Design works are scheduled until mid-2017, but construction and arranging work will begin in the autumn of next year.
As reported, the historic sanatorium complex "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri" is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction is long.
In contrast, the 2010 report also stated that "Ominasis" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control in the sanatorium "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and, as early as 2011, the "completed" of the hotel "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri" was completed.
In October 2014, "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" confirmed its willingness to buy the insolvency estate of the <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium owned by "Ominasis Latvia" at the auction, but a month later the auction was deemed to be uneventful, as the winner was not due in due time.
The sale price was determined according to the start price of the last non-occurring auction - 2.86 million euros.
As LETA was informed by the representative of the city council, Ieva Aile, the municipality, when signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the European Union Structural Funds co-financing the adjacent infrastructure - the restoration of the historic <0xC4><0xB6>emeru park and the restoration of the buildings.
The President will hand over the Order of Three Stars to the Commander-in-Chief Antonenko.
The President of the State, Raimonds V<0xC4><0x93>jonis, will be present next week, on August 16, to the order of the Order of Three Stars III commander, Aleksandar Antonenko, according to the President’s agenda.
The award ceremony of the Order of Three Stars will take place at 13 p.m.
As evidenced by the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from J<0xC4><0x81>zep Medi<0xC5><0x86>a Music College in 1998, where he learned the playing of the instruments and learned to sing with Margarita Gruzdev.
He studied at the Vocal Department of the J<0xC4><0x81>zep V<0xC4><0xAB>tola Latvian Academy of Music in the class of Arv<0xC4><0xAB>d Luste.
In 1997 he started singing in the Latvian National Opera Choir, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in the opera "Al<0xC4><0x8D><0xC4><0xAB>na".
He received the "Big Music Award 2003" for vocal performances in opera performances and Verdi Requiem.
It is indicated that in the 2004/2005 season became the most internationally recognized tenor of Latvia, engaged by the world's largest opera houses.
Since the autumn of 2004, he has been singing "Diseldorf Deutsche Oper am Rhein", in Berlin and Graz, Drezden's "Semperoper", in the Royal Operas of Oslo and Stockholm, in London's Covent Garden, in the Opera of Monte Carlo, in the Vienna State Opera, in the Opera of Geneva and in the Opera of Vienna.
In 2009, Antonenko made his debut in the Metropolitan Opera as Prince "N<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>".
In 2011, Antonenko sang with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in the opera Otello in Paris, in the opera Covent Garden he sang Luigi "Apmet<0xC5><0x86>a" in the new study, as well as participated in the Stockholm performance of Kristof Loja.
A year later, Antonenko sang with great success the role of Otello in the London opera Covent Garden.
The Russian hacker hacked the e-mails of former NATO commander Brydlova.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out a number of other cyber attacks, including hacking the emails of former NATO European Commander Filip Bridlova and the "Open Society" servers of George Soros's "Open Society" Institute.
The hackers published the information on DCLeaks.com.
In addition, there is also a list of Br<0xC4><0xAB>dlova and news about the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, the Institute’s computers have been available for the whole year.
According to Bloomberg news, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian special services, who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of the DNC's computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to formally accuse the servers of the Democratic Party of hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities.
As reported, the website WikiLeaks in July published about 20,000 e-mails from the DNC computer system, from which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party tried to harm the party's presidential campaign in the presidential campaign in the presidential campaign in the presidential campaign in the run-up to the party candidate in the run-up to Hilary Clinton's ex-chief.
As reported by US press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts an investigation into the hacking of democratic servers, as well as other U.S. officials, consider Russia’s involvement in the cyber attack to be unquestionable.
Macartney: Joko Ono's presence threatened The Beatles.
Paul Makartnijs admitted that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of danger for the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star is currently in a "good" relationship with the late John Lennon refugee, but at the time when she went to visit the group to record a studio, he offered Macartney because Ono was the only female member of the group - MacArthur, and Stargate - George Learney.
When the singer was asked about both relationships, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine, "They're really good."
We felt endangered at the time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group couldn’t stand it.
We were able to do it, but not very successful, because we were very tight.
We were not afraid of sexists, but the girls usually did not come to the recording studio, they allowed us to work.
When John started to meet Joko, she wasn’t sitting in the control room, but in the middle of the four of us.
The author of the engraver "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he now regularly contacts the former member of the group Ringo, and confirms the recording of the studio "Apple" from time to time, but otherwise "The Beatles" are "completed".
Asked if he still meets another single member of the legendary rock group, Macartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and at parties.
However, I didn’t go to meetings, and I felt a bit detached from it.
I went to Apple during a serious divorce.
In my place for the meetings I sent John the Truth and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can't stand sitting at that table."
It was too painful, as if we saw the death of our pet.
The company now works in such a way that I just listen to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA’s climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to study the history of Venice using tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, has ever been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have already mentioned in advance that the slow rate of rotation of Venus can be explained by a dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that there was once a plan on Venus, an Earth-like atmosphere, and its rotation slow.
The model also looks at the oldest topography of Venice.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographic diversity on it to allow life to form and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In a simulation of the GISS model, the Venusian rotation model reveals that the part of the daylight on it lasts for 2 months, GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process heats the planet’s surface and causes the matter, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as a rainbow protecting the planet from the sun’s heat.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once habitable, over the course of several billion years Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans evaporated, and the lungs were burned by ultraviolet rays.
With the total evaporation of water, only the thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse gas, the Venus, as we know it today, remains.
The scientists published the results of the new Venera climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from coaching position at Avalanche
On Thursday, Colorado's Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations, Patrick Rojs, filed a dismissal as a reason for undermining the insufficient impact in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's vice president and general manager Joe Sakiks confirmed the news and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposefully fulfilling my duties as the head coach and vice president of the Colorado club's hockey operations," Rojs, 50, said in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team to give it the brilliance it needs and achieve the results of a higher level.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of hockey operations must fully align with the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions related to the performance of the team.
At the moment, these conditions are not met.
Sakiks, who agreed to Roju on 23 May 2013, thanked Roja for his contribution to the team.
He said that Patriks informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and we wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the best coach of the league and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the knockout games, the Colorado team was defeated by Minnesota hockey players. Since then, the club has not been included in the knockout games for two years.
Avalanche ended the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team without receiving a second special invitation from the organizers of the Western Conference.
In his career, famed Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy has won four Stanley Cups - two with Montreal's "Canadien" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea Oil Platform Workers Reopen Negotiations and Delay Strike
Workers’ strikes on the remuneration of workers of North Sea oil platforms have been postponed because the two parties involved in the dispute have resumed negotiations, the leaders of the negotiations said.
Periodically, strikes against the oil treatment company Wood Group are organized on the oil platforms of the North Sea, where the company Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The joint statement states that Wood Group and Unite and RMT have agreed to reopen negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
In the coming weeks, a number of full-day meetings are scheduled to begin at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examining problematic issues.
The trade unions announced that their recent events, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are aimed at a planned reduction of wages by 30 percent.
Due to the negative market pressure, Wood Group this year reduced the salaries of workers in the North Sea by 9%.
As early as 2014, the company reduced the wages of workers on the ground by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive a market downturn.
Shell, in turn, has already reduced wages for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its work by preparing a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, and the situation makes it more difficult for Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, nearly $1.4 billion will be invested in new North Sea projects, compared to the $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades star.
The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalog of the speed of rotation of the stars in the Pleiades star.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in this star orbit at different speeds, as well as how the speed of star rotation relates to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between star mass, age and even the history of its solar system," said Pasadena's Caltech Infrared Process and Center Analysis.
The Pleiades star is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are just beginning to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They rotate at the maximum speed.
When it touches at its maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of stellar wind.
When the stars arrive in the magnetic field, they are slowing down the stars.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable region of stars, such as the solar eclipse.
The newest catalog of star rotation speeds shows that larger stars are rotating slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compares stars to dancers, larger sized dancers perform pirouettes slower than small sized dancers.
Rebulus says that in the "ballet" of the Pleiades, slow-rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster-rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to its proximity to the Pleiades star, it serves as an excellent space laboratory where you can compare the characteristics of the stars with the speeds of rotation.
Rebulus says that the Pleiades star helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of star rotation is slowing down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of the Pleiades star rotation in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
