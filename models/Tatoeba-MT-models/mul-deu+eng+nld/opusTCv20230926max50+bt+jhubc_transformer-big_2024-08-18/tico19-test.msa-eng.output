The rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom confirm that, although at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly contagious in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals and treatment units should increase their readiness for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 that will require health care, and in particular, treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases from unknown etiology had been reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the cause of the novel coronavirus now referred to as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, it has been proven that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 has evolved into a more serious disease that requires hospital treatment, while the remaining 6% have a critical disease that requires proper treatment.
The death rate of patients treated in hospital due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) country and compared those countries with Hubei Region, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with in Italy over 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced the next geographic spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world at this time according to the country's dynamics.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In a March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Europe according to the WHO case description.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 among those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), of which between 31 December 2019 and including the date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, is obtained from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare that data with Italy.
As a proxy for the active spread of COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the cumulative incidence of the last 14 days of COVID-19 cases, therefore taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the number of cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the last 14 days cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follow trends in Hubei Region (China) (Chart 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then rose significantly around February 28, 2020 (Additives).
This is mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar upward trend for the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Additives).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
He stressed that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported the same number of cases as Italy only three weeks earlier or less.
Our decision shows that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed cumulative trend of COVID-19 incidence suggests that the pandemic is contagious at the same rate in all countries.
While countries are at different levels, diversity in national public health responses and possible case definitions varies across countries as well as different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 approval, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected region in Italy described a situation where 10% of patients infected with COVID-19 needed proper treatment and media sources reported that hospitals and treatment units in the region had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or treatment units are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, the data must be collected in a systematic way to support current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the availability of neat beds and intermediary care in Europe, between 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that the country had more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of neat treatment and mediation care for every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios related to the depletion of health care capacity, with a budget for each EU/EEA and UK country for the spread of COVID-19 cases to hospitals associated with <0x3E>90% risk exceeding the capacity of beds of treatment, provided in the sixth update of the CODV-19 rapid risk assessment.
Since so far cases have formed clusters in certain regions in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as hospitals and treatment units usually control a population of clear area concentrations, information on cases and beds of treatment should be provided in Tatanama for the regional unit for statistical level 2 (NTS).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The country, hospitals and treatment units should therefore be prepared for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and an increase in the number of patients infected with COVID-19 who need health care, especially treatment, as is currently the case in the affected region of Italy.
As emphasized in the ECDC's recent rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is important to slow down the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of a contagious approach to the reduction, as they do not respond to the reduction as soon as possible, due to the expectation of a rapid increase in the number of cases that the hospital may not provide to the makers.
A rapid risk assessment also lists general health care measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity that sees countries are likely to continue to increase their control efforts to slow down SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as reduce stress on health care.
If this fails, it is likely that the health care system of other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in patients who need proper treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in disaster for humans.
Just like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also spread out of mosquitoes and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and death rate than SARS but is more likely to be infected and affects more parents than teens and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help in understanding and eradicating life-threatening diseases.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory of Chinese people being urged to sit at home throughout the holiday season and weeks after that as a result of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and a related disease called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and soon spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients allowed to go home and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the No. 1 public enemy" and has the potential to become stronger than violence.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 2,000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the indication of the virus being isolated from several patients.
This review tries to summarize the progress of research in the area of the new and rapidly developing subject.
When appropriate, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease that is caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, triggered in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other important issues.
CoV is traditionally considered to be a pathogen that is harmless to humans, usually causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice discovered high pathogenic human CoV, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks of their origin in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with severe rates of morbidity and death.
Thus, COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, an unknown cluster of pneumonia was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of death from Wuhan has been reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, regions and countries.
On January 20, infection among health care personnel has been reported, indicating that human infections to humans can occur.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was ordered to lock down all public transport services.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Rajah (Rajah 2).
As the situation is developing rapidly, the ultimate scope and severity of the disease has not yet been ascertained.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more recent illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects patients of all ages, but most are 30-65 years old.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected patients are over the age of 50, very few are under the age of 20 and only 14 individuals are under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 develops in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start of the diagnosis.
The average shelf life is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, corresponding to the time of massive movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed case mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large, protected viruses that contain single strands of sensory RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genera, ct., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among all alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
The spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors the angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptideyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for each SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane integration occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the virus gene, the genome RNA is accompanied by the surface glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein forms a virion-containing vesicle, which then forms with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a novel beta-CoV with more than 99.98% of genetic identity in 10 named samples taken from the site of origin of the disease, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transfer electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the thinnest part of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein for SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and have IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyto-EM structure for human ACE2 was fully at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in the complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed validation, has been combined as a dimer and the ACE-BOAT2 complex can combine two S proteins, which provide evidence for screening and CoV infection.
B0AT1 may be the target of therapy for drug screening to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Hoses of origin and middle
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov are derived from molluscs and are transferred to humans respectively through musk and camel.
Through phylogenetic comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, lobster is considered to be the host of origin of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two CoVs such as SARS from lobster called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediary host that helped the virus to cross the species' barriers to infecting humans remains unknown, and the pathway of transmission still cannot be explained.
Ji, et al., proposes snakes as carriers of viruses rather than larvae to humans involving homologous recombinations in S proteins.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that teddy bears - a long-distance ant-eating mammal that has always been used in traditional Chinese medicine - be a potential yag intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of genetic homology in CoV found and on SA-Coing.
However, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, the final decision to provide concrete evidence is awaited (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 45 days below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and a humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, germicides containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chlorophom, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively disable the virus.
The entire human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore considered to be easily attacked by novel viruses.
At this time, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Graph 4).
Generally, after the virus invades the host, the virus is initially identified by the host's natural immune system through pattern identification receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as lectin type C, receptors such as Tol (TLR), receptors such as NOD (NLR), and receptors such as RIG-I (RLR).
Although different pathways, the virus results in the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity and type I interferon cystesthesis (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigen macrophages.
However, the N-SARS-CoV protein can help prevent the virus from responding to the immune system.
Shortly thereafter, the immune response also counteracts the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells continue to kill virus-infected cells.
Helping T cells produce prostate cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T-cell function by resulting in T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral chemistry includes supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have been cured neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, as well as, in the worst-case scenario, the failure of some organs, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, based on early clusters, are more likely to affect gold citizens with comorbidities and pregnant women.
Being common to those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is affected, they have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The average shelf life for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the storage period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as stated above, shows that the storage period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most appropriate shelf-life, while preventing those infected but having no symptoms from spreading the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals who are exposed to, or infected by, the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually a primary and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied without other symptoms or symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, flatulence and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition immediately increases to acute respiratory syndrome, septic fits, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory help.
A similar finding has been reported in two recent family cluster and cluster studies resulting from the spread of asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptom.
However, 80% of them need respiratory help, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher prevalence by MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and neck pain (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are the main symptoms and breathing aid has been needed for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the death toll from COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with 95% above confidence (CI) 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV ranged only from 2 to 4.
The comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rates and RO of the disease is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to be transmitted than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less fatal than the two diseases.
Therefore, it is much more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster starters often occur in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that patients can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and patients who have been cured who are allowed to return home from the hospital may carry the virus again, which sends a warning to increase the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or decreased number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L includes lymphocyte counts <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive proteins as well as erythrocyte sedimentation have increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, the fibrin degradation product present in the blood, has increased, and the number of lymphocytes has decreased significantly.
Abnormality in chest x-rays is found in most COVID-19 patients and is indicated by bilaterally tangled shadows or the obscurity of ground glass in the lungs.
Patients usually have atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of fluids and fibrosis that is likely to severely affect the gas exchange.
Type-I and type-II pneumocytic dysfunctions reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension, while reducing the ability of the lungs to develop and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the finding of a poor chest radiography is usually parallel to the worst stage of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathology analysis for COVID-19 showed the decomposition of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and the absorption of interstitial lymphocytes as well as multinucleated synctium cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infections and SARS and similar pathology.
The scanning of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through transcription-reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to high false negative rates, which may advance the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiology findings is important as well as imperative to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a prototype of the use of CRISPR-based SHERLOCK techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L per cellulite per kilolitre of time using a sample.
Hopefully the new technique can significantly improve sensitivity and ease of use if confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoV, doctors can generally provide supportive treatment to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or suggested before for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have recovered is recommended to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs at the initial stage and may also attack, at a lower level, other organs that produce ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and are a major cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives as well as including general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxidation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary graphing technique used for the treatment of cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections as well as surprises of sepsis, and protection of important organ function are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that cytokine storms result from excessive immune system responses in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of cytokine series including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Suppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include cell-T-directed immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF restrictions; JAK blockage; blinatumomab; cytokine signaling blocker 4; and HDAC blockage.
Steroids, as an immunosuppressant, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
In contrast, steroids at high doses can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period of time have been recommended to be used with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this article, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous use with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in an American patient infected with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed the possibility of contraction of other single-stranded RNA viruses including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this observation, Gilead has given the mixture to China to run a pair of trials against individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly awaited.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, loya, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients who have the same disease or to protect a healthy individual from the infection has a long history.
It is true that patients who have recovered usually have relatively high levels of antibodies to pathogens in their blood.
An antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and it identifies unique molecules in the pathogen and neutralizes them directly.
Based on this, plasma has been collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and have been injected into 10 patients who are in serious condition.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load as well as increased stagnation in the blood.
However, confirmation and explanations are needed to suggest the method for large-scale use before special therapies that have not yet been developed.
In addition, due to the presence of therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can further stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma is great for treating critical patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specialized antibodies quickly to fight global epidemics.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells than patients who have recovered and identify genetic code that encodes effective antibodies or filters effective antibodies against important viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect largely depends on the combination of various components in different formulas according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the components that remain effective are unknown or leaky as it is difficult to extract and validate such components or their optimal combinations.
At present, due to a lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rates of recovery in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have been seen in some regions in China that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei region, which uses TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison because many other impact factors such as the number and degree of severity of the patient need to be included in that assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatment alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, loss of symptoms and hospital treatment was significantly shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rates for symptomatic conditions are getting worse (from mild to severe) significantly lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM<0x2B>TCM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for a more controlled trial at a larger level and in more centers.
It should also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and explain the components that are effective in the treatment of TCM or a combination of those treatments if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly have a great fear of a very easily contagious disease and can cause that death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to higher mental distress and anxiety.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, various psychiatric morbidities including ongoing depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor persistence, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide have been reported.
Mandatory contact and quarantine screening, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause people to feel more worried and guilty about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be given to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and people who are connected to them as well as the public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with constant and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are important to disrupt the transmission chain from infected animal and human areas to the affected host and usually complement antiviral treatment in epidemic control caused by the emerging virus.
Efforts have been made by developing an S-protein-based vaccine to generate long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Weakening vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and models of dangerous challenges as well as their protection against zoonotic viral infections need to be determined before clinical studies are initiated.
This may be because SARS has ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to ongoing zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, particles such as viruses and recombinant protein subunits as well as some have been tested in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulties because a long period of time (average 18 months) is required for the development of vaccines and dynamic variations of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just shown a full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover slowly without being re-infected.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high rates of morbidity and death in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognostic model for the disease is important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas that lack resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 usually occurs at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of the patients over the age of 50 in the study against 8,866 cases stated above.
Patients who require proper treatment are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are much older than those who do not need them (at a median age of 66 compared to 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients' decisions.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as stated above.
Comorbidity and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require proper treatment are more likely to experience acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiovascular disease is also the cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to ACE2-positive cholangiosites, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is reasonable to note that the age and hidden diseases are interrelated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy and final healing.
A CRP-level link to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict decisions.
This enzyme is absorbed extensively in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and is excreted when tissue damage occurs.
Therefore, it becomes a traditional marker for heart or heart dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Breast X-rays and progression of clinical symptoms over time should be considered together with other issues to predict the consequences as well as complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Viewing high doses of corticosteroids has been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As stated above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered from extreme stress as they often face long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the deaths of close family members and patient friends.
It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to a demographic study so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to doubling in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently doubling in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common discomfort.
Therefore, patients infected in the early phase or period of storage can produce large amounts of viruses during daily activities, causing it to be very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur during severe illness, while most transmissions do not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much worse and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are underway in China including lockdown orders in Wuhan and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantine for nearly the entire population in the hope of ending SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
While the move is damaging the economy and other sectors in the country significantly, the number of new patients is decreasing, signaling epidemic losses.
The most optimistic budget is that the outbreak will end at the end of March and the decline phase will run for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be much easier to infect than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the effects of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both the central turbine swab and the patient's skeleton that had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly-known virus could be a recurring influenza-like episode.
However, convincing signals have occurred in China based on the number of new cases that are falling, suggesting that current strategies may be effective.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to be controlled.
Therefore, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection may become weaker and eventually end up or become a less pathogenic virus that exists together in humans.
Comparisons between the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS are provided below (Grade (Grade 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to infect through coughing or sneezing, and can also be infected through direct contact with material that has been infected with the virus.
The virus is also found in dirt, which poses a new possibility of transmission from dirt to the mouth.
A recent study of over 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health officials.
Therefore, careful precautionary measures should be used to protect people, especially health workers, social workers, family members, friends, even those on the roadside who are connected to the patient or the person who is infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing a face mask; both the use of a surgical mask and an N95 breathing mask (series <0x23>1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droppings from individuals who are likely to be infected from spreading through ventilation or attaching to the surface of the material, which can then be spread to others.
However, only N95-type masks (series <0x23>1860s) can protect against virion absorption as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions that can penetrate N95-type masks; SARS-CoV-2 is almost the same as SARS-CoV in terms of size where both are approximately n85.
Since virus particles can penetrate five surgical face masks that are worn together, health care workers who have direct contact with patients need to wear N95 masks (series <0x23>1860s) rather than surgical face masks.
In addition to face masks, health officials need to wear self-protection equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he had worn an N95 face mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eye that was suffering from inflammation.
In this regard, health officials also need to wear a lutsinar face protector or safety eyeglasses when dealing with patients.
For the public in the affected or likely to be affected area, it is recommended that all residents wash their hands with germ-repellent soap regularly, stay at home and reduce contact with individuals who are likely to be infected.
A three-legged distance is considered to be a suitable distance to distance yourself from the patient.
These measures are an effective method in reducing the risk of infection in addition to preventing the transmission of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, a high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 warns China as the SARS outbreak struck in 2003.
However, it was only on January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to reduce the concerns of its citizens by saying that the novel virus had a low rate of infection and limited reproduction in humans as well as prevention and prevention of the disease was not an issue.
The message has eased public concerns, especially when the entire country is preparing for the Autumn Festival, and it cannot be welcomed to curb the spread of the outbreak on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China can take a look at this and make improvements in the future.
For example, the appropriate agency should (1) be more careful in making public announcements, since every detail presented affects the attitudes and decisions of the people; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the extraordinary information received from the clinic than the clinician; (4) be more careful in waiting for a formal report than a doctor or an official; and (3) be more sensitive and responsive to the extraordinary information received from the clinic.
COVID-19 transmission was caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that began in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, it has spread to all over China and nearly 50 countries around the world when this writing was created.
Since the virus is almost the same as SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also almost the same as SARS, the transmission of COVID-19 has created a feeling that the SARS outbreak has been repeated.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important in containing the epidemic as well as treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals than young people and more impacts on men than women, obesity and mortality rates are also higher in older citizens than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without experiencing any symptoms while SARS patients spread the virus in a diseased state, which results in difficulty in containing the transmission of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains the cause of SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The RNA test results for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.
However, patients who have recovered are able to recover positively from the virus.
This discovery indirectly increases the risk of transmission of the virus.
Based on the rapid progress in the study of COVID-19, some critical issues still need to be framed, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homologs are found in SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs such as SARS molluscs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is also derived from molluscs.
Are animals that are intermediary species that spread the virus from the home, for example, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can't resolve the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical model tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how can viruses actually enter airway cells and so on result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2 expression cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis as well as effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically through transmission in humans?
Will it be a worldwide pandemic, eradicated like SARS or repeated periodically like asthma?
This is important but it will take time to find answers to the above questions and various other questions.
However, regardless of the cost to be charged, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as quickly as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronavirus
Mutations and adaptations have been driving co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its main hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) had been known to cause mild illness, such as bronchitis.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks have changed views and revealed how HCoV is horrific and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 has attracted attention to CoV and surprised us with its easy but less pathogenic transmission compared to SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonosis and understanding about the origin of zoonotic HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs are derived from non-pathogenic molluscs.
Intermediate reservoirs for some HCoV are also known.
Recognizing animal hosts has direct implications for human disease prevention.
Investigations on the interaction of CoV hosts in animals allow an understanding of the importance of CoV pathogenesis in humans to be obtained.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing knowledge related to seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of its discovery as well as the origin of zoonotic and transmission between species.
More importantly, we compare and distinguish the difference of HCoV from the perspective of virus evolution and genome reintegration.
Epidemic diseases during COVID-19 are discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful host exchange as well as the implications for the evolution of the virus against the severity of the disease is also emphasized.
Coronavirus (CoV) is a family of Coronaviridae, which consists of a single-stranded, positive-skinned, overlapping RNA virus group.
The genome is between 26 and 32 kilobases long and is the largest genome among RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological shape that looks like crowns under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoV has a non-segmented genome that shares the same composition.
It is estimated that two-thirds of this genome has two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are mutually correlated, which are then translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replication.
The polyprotein is then processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins, known as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORFs for structured proteins, including capacitors (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some customer-specific protein accessories are also encoded according to different CoV customers.
Based on the difference in protein sequence, CoV is classified into four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-Cov gene consists of most HCoV and is divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that mosquitoes and mice act as gene sources for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the primary reservoirs for gamma-CoV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, CoV has overcome species barriers and some of them have emerged as important human pathogens.
So far, 7 human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually result in mild symptoms, such as dizziness and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with a high likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients suffering from coma in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both resulting in self-control symptoms.
This concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is harmless until SARS outbreaks appear.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and was one of the worst in history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a roughly 10% gross death rate.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread around the world.
The novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later dubbed SARS-CoV-2, is an ongoing epidemic-causing agent of the 2010 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as of March 3, 2020.
A warning has been issued and the world needs to be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from mosquitoes, mice and domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all HCovs from mosquitoes, where viruses are easily adaptable and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-2019 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Zoonotic origin detection of HCoV provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving forces and restriction factors for species jumping.
It may also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir animal hoses, intermediates and inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in future abundance prevention.
In this review, we present an overview of the origins of zoonotic, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis for HCoV.
In particular, we outline and discuss a common theme in which the HCoV virion is not pathogenic within the host's natural reservoir but becomes pathogenic after the transmission of the interspecies to the new host.
We also re-examined the direction of HCoV evolution flow, where increased transmission often appears with pathogenic reduction.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoV has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients suffering from bronchitis, different CoVs had been isolated in a variety of infected animals, including duck, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological rules (Table 1) can provide information and instruction.
The first strain of HCoV-229E had been isolated from the respiratory tract of patients who had an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and had subsequently been adapted to grow within the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E are seen with symptoms of coma, including headache, sneezing, bruising and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10-20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 had been isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial citations in the brain of lactating rats.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection is seen similar to HCoV-229E infection, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to become more contagious during winters in temperate climates.
Typically, the shelf life of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild common bronchitis.
Only a few compromised patients show a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is a pandemic caused by the first well-recorded HCoV in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to the super spread, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a shelf life of between 4 to 7 days and a virus-free peak appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed myalgia, headache, fever, dedar and cold, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as a symptom.
Lymphophenia, an elevated liver function test and increased creatine kinase are normal laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffusion of alveolar damage, development of epithelial cells and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require proper treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to infection of the lower respiratory tract, various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in this severe case, usually accompanied by a cyclone of cytokines, which can lead to death especially in compromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from a brother's open lung biopsy to an index patient traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, many attempts have been made to investigate HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 has been isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, the virus was found to be widespread among children, gold citizens and patients compromised with respiratory diseases.
The presence of cortisol, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another free study describes the same virus isolation from the nasal specimen of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is known for certain in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and the peak time of occurrence of the disease is during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and infected bronchiolitis in the community, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Just like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four HCoVs infected in this community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and then cause a highly pathogenic disease, although the accident did occur for an unknown reason as there have been rare cases in China that have been reported in recent times in the more recent HCoV-NL63 subgenus.
In general, when this HCoV acquires the ability to spread efficiently and to remain continuously in the human body, the virus also becomes less mutagenic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most cases confirmed by the lab come from the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary transmission to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations for MERS equal SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients suffering from MERS also experience acute renal failure, which so far is unique to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high case death of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the worst viruses affecting humans.
During mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection had been detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency at the International Level and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with gross case deaths of 3.4%.
The death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the death rate outside the region is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly increase into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the homology of high nucleotide references of 82%, the virus is grouped into different materials on phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more easily contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to rapid worldwide transmission.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from six other HCoVs reveals similarities and very interesting differences.
First, the timing and duration of the occurrence of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs found from the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a feature that is more commonly seen during an HCoV infection found from the community, including the presence of unspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly low.
Thirdly, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also showed interesting pattern characteristics for both HCoV found from the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is at least as high as the HCoV found in the community.
On the other hand, it is difficult to confirm whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is reduced after human transmission as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in dirt samples.
Whether there is a transfer of dirt to the mouth for SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain circumstances awaiting enlightenment through future studies.
It's also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may be triggered according to the season as in the case of infected HCoV in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 include the persistence of infection, pathogenesis and post-human dissemination will affect the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four HCoVs infected in the community causing mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived a past HCoV pandemic.
HCoV that causes severe diseases in humans and humans with severe HCoV disease has been eliminated.
In order to allow this to happen, HCoV needs to be multiplied in humans to a level sufficient to allow the collection of appropriate mutations that fight the host restriction factor.
Therefore, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chances of the virus being fully adapted to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to block with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four CoVs infected in the community circulated in the human population, triggering common paralysis in compromised subjects.
The virus does not require a reservoir of animals.
Instead, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and the transmission of the virus in humans cannot be sustained.
The virus needs to stay and breed in its zoonotic reservoir as well as find an opportunity to spread to easily infected human targets, possibly through one or more host intermediates and breeders.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same characteristics as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoV infected in the community.
It's very easy to infect like HCoV infected in the community, at least at this time.
However, the virus is more pathogenic than HCoV infected in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The time will determine whether the virus will fully adapt to humans and spread among humans without a reservoir or host of intermediate animals.
Before discussing the origins of animals that are the cause of HCoV, it is better to discuss the definition and characteristics of the host of evolution, nature, reservoirs, intermediates and breeding of HCoV.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it has a very close inheritor who shares high homology at the level of nucleotide motion.
The virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, the reservoir hoses store HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host is usually infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or its virions.
Conversely, if a new HCoV is introduced to the intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus does not adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
These intermediate hoses can act as a zoonotic source for human infections and play a role as breeding hoses by allowing the virus to multiply temporarily and then spread the virus to humans to strengthen the scale of human infections.
HCoV can be infected dead if it is unable to maintain its infectivity in the intermediate hose.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediary hoses and also create long-term adjustments.
In this case, the intermediary host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals restrictively that SARS index cases have a history of contact with stray animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies show that animal vendors have a higher anti-SARS-CoV IgG prevalence than the general public.
Mushrooms (Paguma larvae) and snails in the live animal market were initially known to carry viruses such as SARS-CoV that are almost similar to SARS-CoV.
This is supported indirectly with the fact that no SARS has been reported again after killing all the mussels in the market.
However, it has been reported that mosquitoes from forests or farms without exposure to the market of mostly negative SARS-CoV live animals, suggesting that mosquitoes may only be a host of reinforcing mediators but not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Most notably, given that 80% of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that various species of small mammals may also be hosts of strengthening mediators for SARS-CoV should not be eliminated.
All of this seems to be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV.
Further research for natural animal hosts for SARS-CoV reveals closely related CoV molluscs, called CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) Rhinolophus molluscs related to SARS, which exist in Chinese molluscs.
It is positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
This and other CoV strains share 88-92% of the homology of nucleotide references with SARS-CoV.
This study has provided the basis for the new concept that lobster hosts produce human pathogens.
Some CoVs such as SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from lungs, but none other than one called WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known as the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from pollen samples of licorice is shown to use licorice, musk and human ACE2 as the receptor for cell entry.
More interestingly, SARS patients who are recovering have been found to be able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related lineage for SARS-CoV in lungs, sharing 95% homology of nucleotide references.
Although there is a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct-moderate virus for SARS-CoV and larvae are not a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same groups as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV larvae use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
Indication of RNA polymerase depending on the RNA of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the virus in certain beta-CoV larvae known from Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV can be found in wild molluscs.
MERS-CoV and the closest family of CoV-HKU25 larvae share only 87% of the homology of nucleotide orientation.
Therefore, the larvae may not host the reservoir directly to MERS-CoV.
In contrast, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels have a positive effect on MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to camels in the Middle East that come from various African countries.
MERS-CoV living viruses found in humans have been isolated through the nasal swab of the Arabian camel, further indicating that the camel functions as a pure MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It is also worth noting that generally the symptoms are mild but a large drop of the virus has been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
In particular, infected camels release viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the mucous membrane, which is also the pathway for viruses to be released from the lungs.
However, the issue remains since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly associated with the human spread pathway to humans or the unknown spread pathway involving an unknown species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% homologous nucleotides with the CoV RaTG13 molluscs isolated from Rhinolophus affinis molluscs.
In the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the bias deviation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent relationship.
It can be said that the larvae may not be the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 but a similar larvae CoV found in the future.
Possibly, the host of SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animals is one of the wild species sold and killed in the Huanan Marine Food Wholesale Market, which is associated with many early COVID-19 cases, showing the possibility of animal prevalence events to humans.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a small group of endangered mammals known as the javanica may also store beta-CoV strains associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This covalent CoV genome shares 85-92% of the homology of nucleotide references with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90% identity at the nucleotide reference level.
They are collected in two sub-generations of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the pylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RDB) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid reference identity.
In real differences, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more deviant, although it has a higher degree of homology across the genome.
A previous study of infected ticks also reported virus-containing detection of lung samples, which were later found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a collection method and selected a manual array to generate a portion of the partial genome forwards that comprised approximately 86.3% of the full viral genome.
We can't rule out the possibility that tequila is one of the intermediary animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, at the moment there is no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 stems directly from sputum due to a bias between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV related to SARS-COV-2 sputum.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-COV-2 ticks.
The pathway of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in molluscs, molluscs and other mammals still needs to be established.
While the highest homologous sequence has been found in the RBD between SARS-COV-2 and skeletons, beta-CoV is associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 which share the homologous direction of the highest genome.
Strong speculation states that the high-level equation between the RBD of beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 patches and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the choice-based evolution.
One suggestion sided on the recombination of beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 ticks and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As the driving force of evolution, replanting occurs extensively in beta-CoV.
Research is still being done on the direct zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the mollusc CoV, while the virions HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that the ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) molar detected in three-color North American molars shows close links with HCoV-NL63.
Instead, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another beetle CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which has been detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as intermediate host.
For the sake of clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCoV is formulated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for HCoV transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic had been recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species is vague.
But alpha-CoV molars closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them are alpha-CoV alpaca.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from the virus to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas may have contact with insects in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated alpha-CoV molluscs are diverse and non-pathogenic in molluscs, whereas alpha-CoV alpaca triggers respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to exclude that alpaca get HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, rabies is a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too difficult for the mosquitoes to transfer HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, although alpha-CoV is a powder of the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and camels may be a host of intermediates that transmit the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of the transmission between species from squirrels to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolution of the origin of MERS-CoV from lobster is known at the beginning of its introduction and has been reinforced with subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that larvae provide a pool of virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interactions and a strong flying ability are all conditions that encourage the larvae to become the ideal ‘virus spreader’.
In addition, MERS-CoV has been introduced to Arab camels for decades.
It adapts well to these camels that have switched from intermediate hosts to stable and natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains relatively low mutation rates in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is unintentional and humans remain the final host to MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the camel function in the MERS-CoV distribution, the peeling function, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, beta-CoV peels are highly pathogenic in peels.
They may be the final host for beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2, similar to the mustang in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animal to human should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, it can be a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with charcoal through sacrifice or coal mining.
Secondly, tequila can be one of the newly recognized host of intermediate enhancers by the SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Humans are infected with the virus through slaughter and eating runaway animals.
It is possible that many mammals include domestic animals that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
One review of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
The third, as stated above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that had contact with both squirrels and ticks.
The search for animal origins for SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of host animals, the three main factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoV crossing the species' barriers.
First, their mutation rates are relatively high in RNA doubling.
Compared to single-stranded RNA viruses, the predicted rate of CoV mutation can be considered as "simple" to "high" with an average exchange rate of <0x7E>10-4 exchanges per year every 2 sites, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the novel host.
CoV has exoribonuclease test readings, its extinction causes very high volatility and weakness or possibly even a lack of viability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV doubling through this exoribonuclease encoding and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than its host.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when CoV is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, the mutation rates in SARS-CoV-2 seem low, suggesting a high level of adaptation to humans.
Perhaps, he has also adapted to other hosts who are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also applicable to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to Arab camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic marker will make the vaccine and antivirus against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short period of time.
Second, the largest RNA genome in CoV uses additional plasticity in genome changes for mutation and recombination, while increasing the likelihood of joint evolution between species, which is beneficial for the emergence of CoV novels when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoV exchanges templates randomly and frequently during RNA duplication through a unique "three-choice" mechanism.
In the host that serves as a former mixture, the exchange of threads often occurs during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic full RNA can be recombined to produce a new CoV.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural incorporation has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as with CoV animals such as SL-CoV molluscs and CoV-HKU9 molluscs.
The interaction of the host virus is related to transmission.
In addition to the three virus factors stated above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor that affects the transmission between species.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during transmission events between species.
Based on the analysis of comparisons between human ingestion and SARS-CoV mutations, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different host, especially with mutations in RBD on the S protein.
Generally, RBDs on S proteins on CoV interact with cells and are strongly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as joint receptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including mosquitoes, mosquitoes, rats and snails, allowing the spread of viruses between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are observed as distinct from human and mucous viral secretions in RBD and 4 of them are located within receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The mutant SARS-CoV has the mutations K479N and S487T on its RBD, which may enhance the interaction relationship of proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor cells as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV within the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the binding of this S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, the cryo-EM research shows this bond binding that is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors may be necessary for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
More interestingly, the HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors that exist, such as aminopeptidease N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after transmission between species from its animal host.
In addition to cellular receptors, the effect of transmission between HCoV species also depends on the dependence of host and other barrier factors.
The difference between these host proteins and the host of natural HCoV reservoirs such as lobsters, arabic camels and rodent may create barriers to transmission between species.
HCoV needs to capture the host dependency factor and reverse the host restriction factor for transmission between successful species.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the important area of the interaction of these viruses are still unknown and characterized.
Networks around non-biased genomes for host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may yield results.
HCoV novel: back to the beginning
The variety of CoVs gives a wide range of opportunities for the emergence of HCoV novels.
From this point of view, CoV larvae act as a pool of HCoV genes.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein encoding genes has the potential to drastically alter the viral phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV-associated proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adapting to humans, as the SARS-CoV-associated beetle virus has been isolated but found to encode the splashing ORF8 protein.
The nucleotide-29 depletion feature of SARS-CoV has been found in strains isolated at the onset of human epidemics.
This extinction separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that encourages the exchange of host.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma CoV strains, which most smaller recombinant areas have been identified in RNA polymerase depending on RNA.
The recombination location is also known in nsp9, most nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to experience re-combination between different races, which occurs in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events are also observed in other HCoVs, which see HCoV re-assembled with other animal CoVs in non-structured genes.
A warning should also be given that false selection can contribute to unintended changes in the virus's genome, which are most likely to result from freeing the virus from the pressure of the selection being exerted, such as by the host immune system.
One example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strand, as a result of the extinction of two nucleotides.
While strong ORF4 can be seen in HCoV-229E-associated cartilage and camel viruses, alpha-CoV alpaca exhibits single nucleotide insertion, which results in skeletal folding.
Finally, the evolution of the novel HCoV was also triggered by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms have only been detected when a hernia is infected with CoV, indicating a joint adjustment between CoV and hernia.
It seems that the larvae adapt well to CoV anatomically and psychologically.
For example, damage in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses in the bladder effectively reduces the pathology caused by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in tumors is inhibited due to increased regulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 chain and low expression levels for the major histoceseran complex class 1 molecules.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of the larvae can both withstand CoV doubling and affect the test reading by exoribonuclease, while providing selection pressure for the care of a highly pathogenic strain of the virus when introduced to the new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three HCoV novels have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as lobsters and camels.
It quickly doubles without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where lies the secret of the asymptomatic carriers seen and the cause for severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mostly due to the activation of a hyper immune response and a cyclone where the stronger the immune response, the worse the damage to the lungs.
Instead, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been compared to CoV doubling.
The same strategy that disengages the immune response may have a beneficial effect in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is very strong in the lungs.
Therefore, the administration of type 1 interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of inflammatory hormones in the bladder is ineffective.
For this reason, the NLRP3 inflammatory blockage with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common themes of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-CoVs that share 95% of the homology of nucleotides with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also beta-CoVs that share 96% of the homology of nucleotides with SARS-CoV-2.
Although mosquitoes and other animals on the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the direct host for SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
A highly homologous beta-CoV tequila with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, indicating that tequila may be one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV tequila may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was produced by humans either intentionally or inadvertently.
CoV has returned to focus as a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies on CoV in molluscs and other animals have drastically changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from molluscs and transferred to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and mussels in the market, shutting down the wet market and killing mussels should be able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, ticks should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of multiple beta-CoV offspring of ticks closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through ticks and other mammals needs to be explained in future investigations.
Instead, MERS-CoV has existed in Arabic camels for a long time.
This camel has become an important tool for transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and fur products for the local community.
This camel is found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as is done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the retransmission of MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine to fight MERS-CoV for camels, which is combined with other infection control steps.
Since we can't get rid of this virus, new genotypes may appear to cause outbreaks.
Several zoonotic CoVs are scattered in the forest.
In particular, the CoV has a wide range of zoonotic potentials.
There are many opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and rejoin, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more easily contagious and/or potentially deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a long time.
The virus stays in the natural reservoir until there is a chance to become infected.
Although mosquitoes have many features that facilitate the spread of the virus, human chances of having contact with mosquitoes and other wildlife species can be minimized if the community is educated to keep the animals away.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans as well as outbreaks in the future.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonosis of the virus is with humans to keep away from the natural ecology of the reservoir for the zoonotic virus.
Some of the questions about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still unanswered.
Firstly, if the larvae transmit the inherited SARS-CoV-2 virus to the larvae, it is definitely interesting to see how the larvae and larvae can share the same ecological nic.
Secondly, if the cradle plays a more direct role in transmitting to humans, we must determine how humans get in touch with the cradle.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a real intermediary host, how it interacts with different species including humans, molluscs and molluscs needs to be explained.
Finally, since many mammals including exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it be molluscs, ticks or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar mutant virus will be identified in its natural host in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this area will explain the pathway of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of diagnostic criteria "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" for COVID-19 required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline provides our sera experience as a good reference to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is slowly increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we have responded to one review on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named acute respiratory syndrome severe coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO announced COVID-10 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick guidance guideline and the guideline has been published in the Resistance Military Health Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is slowly increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies to be updated continuously.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, have issued a number of seven editions with several contexts being changed.
Now our guideline receives reviews by Zhou et al., they introduce easy marketing suggestions based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence to our guidelines and also become a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We recognize their important efforts and say thank you.
However, their efforts also require an update according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Trials Edition) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires a combination of any one item from the epidemiological history feature with two items of clinical manifestation to produce a thorough analysis, or need to meet three items of clinical manifestation if without a clear epidemiological history:

Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the imaging characteristic of COVID-19 infection; (3) white blood cell counts indicate normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte counts at the initial stage.
The confirmed positive case diagnosis must be based on the suspected case with any pathogenic or serological evidence such as the following: (1) a real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a reference to the genome of the whole virus shows high homogeneity to the known novel coronavirus; (3) a positive to the novel coronavirus.
We can see that real-time PCR tests for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples have been added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples has been included in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then serological evidence is included in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the ongoing work of researchers looking for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for immediate detection, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which improve the availability of different specimens, and support the bringing positive antibody decisions that have been specifically credibly in place.
In addition, there is an increasing amount of evidence that reminds us to be wary of typical or asymptomatic symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart from Zhou et al. should be updated, as they describe invidivu without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be confirmed in subsequent clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and invite readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we propose to monitor and comply with the new guidelines of their country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily count
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day caused by the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Pest Studies (IEDCR) reported the number of infections recorded including 114 active cases and 33 home-based recovery cases.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two of them 51 and 60, and 41-50 years old.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials told a local news source, the Anadolu Agency, that one of the patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Maitree Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed longer than the original plan, until Saturday.
The public transport closures originally started on March 26 and are scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of important goods -- medicines, oils and food -- is still allowed.
The first Covid-19 incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people returning from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths have been linked to COVID-19, an outbreak caused by the coronavirus.
Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infection on the same day and Zambia had the first coronavirus-related deaths.
North Korea claims, so Thursday, it is among the few countries that are free from coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, contributing to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting from Johns Hopksins University data, more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday as a result of a coronavirus infection.
Around the world, countries announce more stringent measures to stop the outbreak from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergie Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
Across the country, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian people may continue to be paid salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the emergency to 15 days; the vote was approved with 215 votes in favour, ten exceptions, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the lockdown order in the holy cities of Makkah and Medina to throughout the day; previously, the lockdown order was only carried out between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to execute a lockdown order between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the house seating order until May 1.
Shops in Australia have lowered the limit of toilet tissue once in business.
In the evenings of Sunday and Saturday, the Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet tissue to two and one package of one deal each in all stores at the national level.
ALDI also introduced the limit of one package, on Monday.
This had been broadcast as an order on the exit list, and on the chain's Facebook page.
Buyers are reported to buy stocks due to COVID-19 fears if individuals need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet tissue for the purchase of home delivery to one package per order.
This change was followed by a four-pack restriction for each deal introduced by Woolworths and Coles respectively on March 4 and 5.
Coles, in a media broadcast on March 8, reported that with the implementation of the four-pack restrictions, "many stores still run out of stock within an hour of delivery", and labeled the request as "never happened", while ALDI, in a Facebook broadcast on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales rose in "suddenly highs" last week, according to Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To continue to alleviate the shortcomings, Coles booked larger packages than suppliers and increased delivery rates, Woolworths booked additional stock, while ALDI made stock for special Wednesday plans that could be obtained early.
Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers were trying to increase stock but local council restrictions at the time of delivery by truck made it difficult.
He expects an increase in the cost of the product, when the supplier tries to meet the demand, and a little special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following initial stock production, some stores may not run specials on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer at Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills the inventory every night.
He told the toilet tissue was a big thing, leading to a low amount of stock, and, when it was sold out, leaving a large empty shelf space, further strengthening the feeling of deficiency.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [about] if there are a variety of items on the shelves, if products such as toilet fabrics and napkins can be [buyed] and have a quantity, you'll probably reduce the panic, says Russell Zimmerman on ABC News.
The toilet tissue manufacturer recycled publisher Who Gives a Crap on Wednesday they had run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who created Kleenex Tandas Tissue, and Solaris Paper who created Sorbent, confirmed that they were working 24/7 to maintain supplies, according to a New.com.au report.
Domain.com, the real estate site, reports that some property sellers offer free toilet tissue to the first riders at a seance session in Melbourne, when a small amount of seance is held as buyers face off during the long days off of Labor Day.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight faces of additional letters intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
The stores initially refused to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 that witnessed them saying they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, composting materials, dry food, hand-washing tools and flooring.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday evening the online supermarket Ocado was seen limiting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 as a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak — a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, not how dangerous the particular case is, the WHO is aware of the need to urge the government to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If a country detects, tests, treats, isolate, monitors and moves its people to act, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s Chief Executive Officer.
We are very concerned about both the worrying stages of transmission and anxiety as well as the worrying non-acting stages.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a citation published by CNN in February, "other than the flu, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the emergence to the ongoing worldwide transmission."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to announce the outbreak as an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "in short, the situation will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak had been identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, announced as a General Health Emergency at the International level on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, causing approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate has been estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide between 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may be between two to fourteen days.
No specific vaccines or antiviral treatments are known.
The main treatment is symptomatic therapy and support. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, closing the mouth during coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring as well as self-isolation for those who suspect themselves of being infected.
Authorities around the world have reacted by implementing travel restrictions, quarantine, lockdown orders, workplace hazard control and facility closures.
This pandemic has led to a global socioeconomic disruption, a suspension or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread supply shortage driven by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, others of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, as well as those from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of travel reductions and heavy industry closures, there is a decrease in air pollution as well as carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei province's capital) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases from unknown sources on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases are related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and cause the virus to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the coronavirus, the tick-borne virus, and SARS-CoV.The earliest known person to have experienced the symptom was later found to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent relationship with the virus.
For the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case that was traced back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province, may be the first case.On February 26, 2020, the WHO outlined that, while a new case reported in China, it was reported that it was in China, but suddenly it was in China.
There may be a corresponding number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among adolescents, with those aged 19 and below equaling 2.4% of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom's scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before immunity is grouped.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose tests have been positively confirmed according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had an official basis not to test those with mild symptoms alone, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections have not been detected, and that this unrecorded infection is a source for 79% of the cases recorded.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was greater than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the number of increases (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formulated that the number may be 5.7.
Most people who suffer from COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who don't, the time to develop symptoms until death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths were among those over the age of 60, and 75% had existing health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to people who have been tested positive for COVID according to the protocol ra.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who died without being tested - e.g. at home, in care centers, etc.
Separate data from Italy found that the excessive number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: "We know [the number of deaths declared] is less than the budget," a statement backed by the first controversial report on the undercount in the U.S.A.A.A.A.'s January 1 death rate was less than 1 in 2009.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths each country has been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and regions have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Several steps have been commonly used to declare the death toll.
This figure varies by area and by time, as well as is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the choice of treatment, the time since the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health. The proportion of deaths in a given case describes the number of deaths divided by the balance.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death toll for global cases was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary depending on the area.
In China, the estimate for the mortality rate with cases decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020).Other dimensions include the case mortality rate (CFR), which describes the percentage of those who are diagnosed with undiagnosed cases and those who die from disease, and the rate of infectious death (FR).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a special population from infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate this number for a special population.
The University of Oxford's Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above budget for this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on the CFR budget.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and peak period of the outbreak is uncertain and can vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Leave unchecked, the infectious outbreak is usually horizontal and then begins to deteriorate when the disease runs out of available housing.
But it's almost impossible to make any reasonable assumptions now about the timing of the situation."
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the pandemic could end by June" if all countries can be moved to comply with the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, perhaps for a year or two".
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical custody and other measures would be required "so that vaccines are available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I don't think this coronavirus—because it's so easily contagious—will disappear completely" and it "may be a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The incidence of that recurrence will depend on the immunity of the group and the stage of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific and the person infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Uncommon symptoms include fatigue, earning respiratory sputum (right), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people suffer from it.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the symptoms of anxiety as persistent difficulty breathing, pain or pressure on the chest, shocking confusion, difficulty in getting up to sleep, and eye or lips can turn into bluish-blue as soon as possible; medical treatment as soon as possible, as soon as possible.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with the results of a test confirming the infection, so researchers have issued advice that they with close contact with the confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and checked to ensure no infection.
China estimates that the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a little to 44%.
The usual shelf life (the time between infection and symptoms begins) ranges from one to 14 days; most commonly five days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimated breakdown of people suffering from COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small drops produced during coughing, sneezing, or speaking; with close contact being at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that unprotected coughs will cause ai droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transferred through a small permanent drop in the air for a longer period, which may be generated while speaking. Respiratory titration may also be produced during breathing, including while speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The titration may land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby or may be sucked into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the respiratory tract to become swollen and thus result in the dispersion of the air.
The virus can also spread when a person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, and then they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns that the virus can spread through dirt, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of transmission of the infection into the mouth of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most easily infected during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but the infection may occur before the onset of symptoms and at a later stage for the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggest that transmission may occur before there is a significant symptom.
There are few confirmed asymptomatic cases in the lab, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during the contact detection investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not so clear how easily the disease spreads, one usually infects two to three others. The virus persists for hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus is found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for a day on cartons, and for up to four hours on copper.
These, however, vary based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people suffering from pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the home soap, which destroys its protective cover.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (descent B) along with two strands obtained from the larvae.
The virus was 96% similar at the full genomic stage to a sample of other coronaviruses (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in a certain portion of the genome's orientation between viruses rather than smearing with viruses than humans.
The entire genome difference so far found at most 92% of the genetic material shared between the tick coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove ticks as an intermediary housing.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily on the basis of symptoms, even if the certifier eventually undergoes reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for infected strains or CT imaging.
One study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with most of its imaging features overlapping with the process of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to screen or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
The WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-1, with the first being released on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on a respiratory or blood sample.
The test results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is carried out with a nasopharyngeal swab but a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have proven to be appropriate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging features on X-rays and computed tomography (CTs) for symptomatic fungi include asymmetrical side-glazing and absent pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiology Association is gathering an international online database to find a remedy for a confirmed case.
As a result of its association with other infections such as adenoviruses, PCR-enabled imaging has limited specialization in identifying COVID-19.
One large study in China compared the results of chest CT to PCR and showed that although impregnation is less specific to infection, the method is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that the method is considered as a scanning tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging viruses with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining overall good self-cleaning, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwash hands, and coughing or sneezing on tissue and placing the tissue directly into a garbage can.
Those who may have been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Physical detention measures are also proposed to prevent transmission. Many governments have blocked or advised to avoid all unimportant travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has already reached the level of community transmission in much of the world.
This means that the virus is spread in the community, and some community members do not know where or how they are infected. A health care provider that takes care of a person who may be infected is recommended to use standard cautionary measures, precautions for more contact, and eye protection. Scanning and contact is an important method of detecting.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement requesting restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log close to a user with another cell phone.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Wrong responses are circulating about ways to prevent infection; for example, rinsing their noses and coughing up with a mouthwash is ineffective.
There are no COVID-19 vaccines, although many organizations are trying to develop the vaccine.
Washing hands is recommended to avoid the spread of the outbreak.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after inhaling their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective bubbles.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitization with at least 60% alcohol depending on the content when soap and water are not available for use.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to an infectious agent for stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and krohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in facilities such as offices or day care centers, all areas such as offices, water rooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by a sick person must.
Health organizations recommend that people close their mouths and noses with bent arms or tissues during coughing or sneezing, and dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing masks can limit the amount and distance of travel of scattered droplets during speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of using masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene care."
The WHO has recommended wearing masks by those who are healthy only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for people who have COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of face masks by community members.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy community members, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask while using public transport or in a crowded place.
Thai health officials encourage people to make fabric face masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia ban access to public places without wearing a mask or covering someone’s nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to a public place to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government stipulates that everyone who enters a retail store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks every day since mid-March, asked train and bus passengers between the cities to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has required the wearing of a face mask when it comes out, while also recommending making a face mask at home for those who can't buy a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social imprisonment (also known as physical imprisonment) is accompanied by infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social imprisonment methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless shelters, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments now require or recommend social imprisonment in the region affected by the outbreak.
The maximum assembly size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations is rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 transmission in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public holidays by more than two people. Elderly adults and those with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and the immune system could be socially compromised in the face of the risk of "increased diseases and complications as well as dynasties."
The use of the term "social prison" has led to the implication that people should undergo full social isolation, rather than encouraging them to get in touch with others through alternative ways. Some parties have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
This includes suggestions for having sex only with someone who lives with you, who doesn't have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended to those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or proposed self-quarantine to the entire population living in the affected area.
The strictest self-quarantine directives have been issued to those belonging to high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have previously traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategy in controlling the outbreak is to block or suppress, and reduce.
The immunization is carried out at the initial stage of the outbreak and aims to monitor and isolate those infected as well as introduce measures to control infection and other vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the transmission of the disease, the effort then moves to the level of sterilization: measures are taken to slow down the transmission and reduce its impact on the health care system and society.
A combination of damping and reducing steps may be carried out at the same time.
The pressure requires more decisive steps to bring down the pandemic by reducing the number of basic breeding to less than 1. Part of the task of managing the spread of infectious diseases is to try to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as the flattening of the epidemic envelope.
This reduces the risk of health services becoming overloaded and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
China's non-pharmaceutical hand-to-hand interventions that can manage the transmission include personal prevention measures, such as hand-to-hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; society's actions aimed at physical incarceration such as closing schools and canceling mass gatherings; community engagements to inform.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the transmission of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and local quarantine, as well as issued a warning about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who quarantine themselves and imposes a high fine on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the earnings of face masks and penalized the increase in medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that reductions (slow but do not stop the spread of epidemics) and stress (reversing epidemic growth) have a major challenge.
An optimal reduction policy may reduce health care demands to a peak of 2/3 and deaths by half, but it still causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and the health system to be burdened.
Pressure may be optional but it should be maintained as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until the vaccine exists, if it comes first), as the spread will immediately resume when the preventive measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic resulted in social and economic costs.
No antiviral drugs have been specifically approved for COVID-19, but efforts to develop them are underway, including testing existing ones.
Eating an antiperspirant given in the counter, drinking water and resting will help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids may exacerbate the consequences.
Some compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and home treatments" can provide relief to the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adjustment of health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a basic outbreak response step.
The ECDC and WHO regional officials in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and major health care services to mobilize resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, rescinding personnel with COVID-19 testing and rescinding elective procedures, dissolving and dissolving COVID-19.
There are various theories about where the first case (called an empty number patient) originates.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei slowly increased.
The case is mostly associated with the Huanan Marine Food Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus originates from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, has zoonotic origins. The inflammatory cluster of lungs of yag is not known to be the cause of the lungs.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about "coronavirus-like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, have been warned by police for spreading false wind news, and another, Ai Fen, has been harassed by his superiors for raising the matter.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation in early January. At the initial stage of the outbreak, the number of cases more than doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, aided by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan became the hub of transportation and a major train exchange.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had also shown symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States had overcome China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have been confirmed.
About 200 countries and regions have had at least one case.

On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in an emergency form, rising to 2.6 billion two days later — about one-third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report suggests the initial case was on 17 November.
Doctor Zhang Jixiang observed a cluster of unknown cases of pneumonia on December 26, then his hospital informed the CDC Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
Initial genetic tests for patient samples on December 27, 2019 showed the presence of coronaviruses such as SARS.
The public notice was issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was informed on the same day.
At the time of the announcement, doctors in Wuhan had been warned by police that they had "disseminated wind news" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission to humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to prevent the spread of the virus.
In a situation that has been dubbed the "largest quarantine in human history", the quarantine convent has been announced on January 23 that stopped the trip in and out of Wuhan, which has been extended to a number of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a number of at least 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.

In addition to the newly built hospital, China has also modified 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government began the next step to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and continuing the Spring Festival holiday.

The Hong Kong and Macau regions began several steps, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
Work from a distance has begun in some parts of China.
Travel restrictions are designed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public movement controls have been implemented in many cities, and it has been estimated that approximately 760 million people (more than half of the population) are facing some sort of external restrictions. After the transmission entered the global phase in March, the Chinese government took strict steps to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has enforced 14 days of mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On 23 March, Greater China only one case of spread in the country within 5 days, in this example the traveler returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the widespread domestic transmission case had been essentially blocked and its transmission had been controlled by China.

The national health agency reported a marked increase in cases confirmed on February 20, largely linked to the gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
The Shincheonji attacker who visited Daegu from Wuhan is suspected of being the cause of the transmission.

All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirming that three members of the army were positive for the virus.
The airline’s schedule was also affected and the schedule was therefore changed. South Korea introduced a program that is considered to be the world’s busiest and most regular program to filter populations for virus detection, and isolate any infected individuals as well as track and quarantine people associated with them.
The scanning methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptons by new international arrivals through mobile applications, guided virus testing past with decisions available the next day, and improved testing capabilities that allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.
South Korea's program is considered successful in curbing the outbreak even though it does not quarantine the entire city. South Koreans were initially opposed to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.

The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several incidents of shortages of supplies, due to the use of equipment to combat the increasing outbreak worldwide, panic purchases, and disruptions to factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increasing consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Some areas are also witnessing panic buying that leads to slippery shelves from items of need such as food, toilet tissue, and bottled water, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry has mainly warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the regular price and also caused delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that this would endanger the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity has caused a shortage of baby formulas in several supermarkets and has been banned by the Australian government before. Behind the prevalence of high COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the continued high demand for food products, both regions have survived from severe food shortages.
The steps taken by China and Italy to combat the collection of goods and the sale of illegal products have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages that have been expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with significant agricultural output does not see a large reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
The vacant food shelves are only temporary, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released khinzir storage to ensure adequate housing for the population.
The same law exists in Italy requires food producers to keep reserves for such an emergency.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China has been badly affected in the first two months of 2020 as a result of steps taken by the government to control the spread of the virus, and retail sales plunged by 20.5%.

Short-term work compensation schemes have been implemented by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sector has been profoundly impacted by the pandemic, impacting the organization's operations as well as individuals both working on payroll and work-free around the world.
Art and culture sector organizations seek to enhance their (usually publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to communities, maintain the safety of their workers and communities, and support artists whenever possible.
Until March 202, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions have closed exhibitions, event presentations and shows were cancelled and suspended so that time is uncertain.
In response, there are intensive measures to provide alternative services through a digital platform. Another recent and growing fallout as a result of the outbreak is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology seminars, and conferences.
The film industry was also affected. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week welcome in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian-repentant season, has been cancelled.

The outbreak affected the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to the date after 2020 but not exceeded the world's current date in the summer of 2021".
This has caused many gambling feet to switch to online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new enrollment rates. The entertainment world has also been affected, with various music groups hanging out or cancelling a sightseeing concert.
Many large theaters such as the Broadway theater also hang all the performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or making web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and introduce their works.
On the internet, many Internet-themed coronavirus memes have spread as many turn to jokes and entertainment behind uncertainty.
Since the onset of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hot locations in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fears, suspicions, and atrocities have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) have recorded racist sentiments described in various groups around the world saying Chinese people deserve the virus or accept what is claimed as fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Most Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination based on their region of origin.
There is support for China, both online and offline, as well as against them in areas severely affected by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak into the new hot zone country, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, can also be the suspects of wasangka and xenophobia.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods for detecting the presence of viruses as well as methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibody screening (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show the number of patients who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to be reported or who are asymptomatic.
The exact rate of death due to the disease and the level of immunity of the group in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
As a result of limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has data that can be expected about the prevalence of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is considerable diversity in the number of tests that have been conducted across countries.
This diversity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case death rate, which may be overestimated significantly in some countries.
Using reverse polymerase chain reaction transcription (rRT-PCR) real-time tests can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.
The decision is usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a throat swab can only be trusted in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear in the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second ear, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from within the airway of the yag in the use of an absorption catheter or the material causing a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse polyemerase response transcription (rRT-PCR), and became the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed the test by January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the PCR-based, clinical grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection kid SARS-CoV-2 on January 28, 2020.
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Product Administration of China.Non-Commercial (Non-Commercial) Data for SARS-CoV-2 detection kits (Non-Commercial) to China.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit led to uncertain decisions due to damaged reagents, and a bottle neck test at the CDC in Atlanta; this generated an average of less than 100 samples a day successfully processed throughout February 2020;
Tests using two unconfirmed components were reliable until February 28, 2020, and before that state and local labs were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Licensing. The U.S. commercial laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics also makes COVID-19 tests available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit has been announced; sampling and processing must be carried out according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests have been developed and produced by the VECTOR State Center for Research in Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test for detecting COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was granted a one-time, 4, 24-hour, 24-hour FDA approval for a test that could be performed in 3.5 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use (USA) license to Abbott Laboratories for testing over the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued a similar license to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also accepted the U.S. from the FDA for a test that lasted approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid magnification technology rather than PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of temperature-changing cycles this method can give a positive result in as fast as five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to speed up production to deliver 50,000 tests a day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the proteon nucleocapsid (N protein) novel of the novel coronavirus are being developed in Taiwan, with the same hopes that the mini-tests can provide 20 tests.
In March 2020 a review of the paper concluded that "the chest radiograph has a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the discovery of CT [computer tomography] may have been present even before the symptoms began."
Typical features of CT include the divisive multilobar earth glass folding with side, asymmetrical and posterior scattering.
The dominance of the subpleura, the opening of the mad and the merger formed as the disease evolved.
One study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, with many of its imaging features acting on the process of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the College of American Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect the infection in individuals starting 7 days or later after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Assessments can be done in the central laboratory (CLT) or through point-of-care (PoCT) tests.
The automatic high cell count system in many clinical laboratories will be able to carry out this assessment but its availability will depend on the rate of income for each system.
For CLT single peripheral blood specimens are usually used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT a single blood sample is usually obtained through a puncture on the skin.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required prior to assessment. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that gave the agency the information as needed and therefore could now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the approval of emergency use.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than the conventional PCR assessment for viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the UK found no purchased antibody test kits good enough to use.
Hong Kong has provided an outpatient scheme for patients who are at risk of being able to stay at home, the "emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they are sliding into the tube, sending it back and getting a test result soon after. The NHS British has announced that they are leading a scheme for testing cases.
Last guide center has helped South Korea conduct among the fastest, most comprehensive tests compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Medical Health Insurance Experts Statutory said on March 2, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests a day in an outpatient setting and 10,700 in-patient examinations had been conducted.
The cost is borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a medical professional.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, the driving test has been offered in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany is unknown, as only positive results have been reported.
The first laboratory examination was conducted in February 2020 with a minimum of 483,295 samples tested, including the week of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam reported that they developed and tested 64.
With construction monitored by BGI founder Wan Jian and taking 5 days, the model has shown cases in Hubei will be 47% higher and the corresponding cost of controlling the quarantine will double if the test capacity does not reach the target.
Wuhan's lab has been immediately inspected by Hou Yan's lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a number of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020 the total daily amount is 50,000 tests per day. Open source, multiplex designs issued by Origami Assays have been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assessments. This balanced design can be carried out in the lab.
Until March, shortages and insufficient reagents have made it difficult for large-scale testing in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted several authors to explore the sample supply protocol that involves heating the sample at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.On March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was in the process of testing more people for the Coronavirus.
This is through a combination of past leadership capabilities, and the purchase of a population-scale-mass-processing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Hou-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is able to run thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world on this scale to be controlled outside of China.
A variety of tests that target different parts of the coronavirus's genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted a German method for earning kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was published on January 17, 2020; a protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not exist until January 28, delaying existing tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had a problem with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of its draft, and the country and Australia were unable to comply with the provisions of the existing kits.
On the contrary, experts said South Korea's widespread willingness to make tests helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for improving the testing program as the best method to slow the pace of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus led to the suspension of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of chemicals and reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately on their test kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had a "weakness;" the government subsequently issued bureaucratic restrictions that had prevented private testing. The Spanish state bought the test kit from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co. Ltd, but found the decision incorrect.
The company explains that an incorrect decision may result from failure to collect samples or use the kit correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would retract the kit that returned the wrong decision, and would replace it with the different test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China made the wrong decision. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that this kit be discarded to the Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health told the test kits that Turkey bought from China had "a high rate of error" and did not "use it". The UK country bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 it was not allowed to announce the test kit.
The tests, followed by quarantining those tested positive and detecting those associated with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals in, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the first site of COVID-19 deaths in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests on an entire population of nearly 3,400 people, approximately ten days away.
Nearly half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found had been quarantined.
With travel restrictions, this has eliminated the new infection as a whole.
With aggressive contact detection, travel restrictions, tests, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has moved slower than other developing countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail stores.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun advising its people to sit at home on March 28, but the school will reopen in time after the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries have also controlled pendants by aggressively tracking contacts, entry restrictions, tests and quarantine, but with less aggressive emergency orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
One statistical study found that more countries do tests, relative to the number of deaths, have a low mortality rate, perhaps because these countries can detect those who have only mild symptoms or no directly better.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries that do not have the capacity of national testing and laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for validation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "Positive as % test" is influenced by the state's test policy.
Countries that only test individuals who are admitted to hospital will get a higher positive score as a percentage of tests than countries that test all people, whether they show symptoms or not, the rest are the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning a person's hands that aims to remove soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at a certain "critical time" during the day prevents the transmission of many diseases, for example diarrhea of chickenpox and years, which spread through the dirt pathway to the mouth.
Individuals may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five critical times during the day that witnessed washing hands with soap are important include: before and after disposing of large water, after cleaning the child's back or changing the diaper, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or controlling raw meat, fish or birds.
If there is no water and soap, the hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after meals.
Before and after the treatment of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning the children who have used the toilet.
After ingesting the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal dirt.
Medical hand sanitation refers to the practice of sanitation related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before controlling the drug or taking care of the medicine can prevent or minimize the transmission of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who control food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, coronaviruses and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lowering the death rate of the baby at birth at home.
A study in 2013 showed that improved handwashing practices would lead to a small increase in high growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates associated with respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, for example, washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that recommend hand washing can reduce the episode of gout diarrhea by about one-third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in episodes of gout diarrhea can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to avoid diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behaviors are performed at home, school and the entire world community.
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under the age of five, sacrificing the lives of about 1.8 million children a year.
Sneezing and pneumonia together cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, planting a habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or combination of medications, reducing diarrhea deaths by nearly half and deaths by acute respiratory infections by nearly a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other hand sanitation interventions as part of a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program.
Washing hands can also protect against impetigo that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect when washing hands too often is that washing hands too hard can lead to skin damage due to dryness on the skin.
A study from Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among health care workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day at which washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the transfer of a dirty outbreak to the mouth: after using the toilet (kissing, sneezing), after cleaning the back of the child (changing diapers), before soaking the child, before eating or/after preparing food.
Another time when washing hands properly should be practiced to avoid the spread of disease including before and after treating cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing the nose; after touching the animal's dirt or controlling the animal; and after holding the garbage.
The rate of hand washing using soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, a recent study on hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households had a practice of washing their hands with soap. In 2014, a study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle of the rate of 77 percent; and China was at the lowest rate of 23 percent.
The Important Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Rinse twice a year, plus wash your hands every day with soap, and rub your teeth every day with florida.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be enhanced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solutions, and increase solubility.
Water is not an effective skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, are not soluble in water.
However, proper water flow helps to clean up..
Due to its reusable properties, peeled soap may store bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated soaps found that transfers are unlikely because bacteria are discarded when washed with foam.
The CDC site still states "liquid soaps that are removed without using hands are better".
Antibacterial soaps are highly promoted to health-important people.
There is no evidence so far that the use of antiseptics or disinfectants is recommended to choose antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistance to strains of organisms.
So, even though antibody-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, this advanced formulation may contain acetic acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, active benzoate acid antimicrobial and further skin burners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, etc.) are anti-inflammatory.
Water is not too hot to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove natural oils that have soil and bacteria.
Unlike what many people believe, scientific studies show that using soda has no effect on reducing the content of microbes on the hands.
A hand cleanser or antiseptic is a non-water-based hand cleanser.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcoholic beverages (also known as alcohol-based beverages, antiseptic beverages, or hand sanitizers) began to be popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with thickening agents such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into gels, or humectants such as glycerin into liquids, or foams for ease of use and to reduce the effects of alcohol drying.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide will further increase antimicrobial activity. Hand cleaner containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol is an effective germ remover.
Drinking alcohol kills bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and several viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol liquor cleaner containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logs, equal to reduction of 35 decibels) bacteria on the hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% (reduction of 4 to 5 logs) bacteria on the hand 1 minute after use. Hand cleaner against several viruses. Most effective against bacteria and less effective.
Alcohol-based handwashing is almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) type virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. An adequate hand antiseptic or alcohol smear should be used to dry or protect both hands properly.
The front and back of both hands and between the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel becomes dry.
Fingertips also need to be washed well, by rubbing them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than hand-washing gums, especially when the hands look dirty.
The use of this agent increases due to its easy use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms. However, it should not replace proper hand washing unless there is no soap and water.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand cleansers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effects of drying alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand cleaners containing emollients cause a marked reduction of irritation and dryness on the skin compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergy contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol shakes are rare.
The tendency to more reduce irritating contact dermatitis becomes attractive than using soap and water to wash hands.
The agent is not water, although effective, does not clean the hands of organic matter. It just wipes out germs.
This is because handwashing is not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as the pathogen is still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free handwashing depends high on its herb and its formulation, and in terms of its history it is less successful than alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol that has been shown to reduce its effectiveness after multiple use, possibly due to an inappropriate reaction to the skin progressively.
Most low-income people are unable to have soap, instead they use ash or soil.
Dust or soil may be more effective than using water alone but may be less effective than soap.
Anxiety exists if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms that may increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Abu is also a soap-like germ-repellent agent because it forms an alkaline solution if it comes in contact with water.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of the disease include the following steps:
Wet hands with soft or cold running water.
Water flow is recommended because standing bran may be evaporated, at the same time the water temperature does not seem to have an effect.
Wash your hands while rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hand, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than just water.
Sental for at least 20 seconds.
Touching creates a shift, which helps to get rid of the germs from the skin, and tingling with longer discards more of the germs.
Wash well with flowing water.
rinsing in the rinse can resuscitate the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry by air.
Wet and damp hands are easier to get dirty again. The fingers, wrists, the part between the fingers and under the fingernails are the part that is always overlooked.
Microorganisms may be stored in fake nails and leaked nail paint.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent the hands from becoming dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
There are various inexpensive options to facilitate hand washing if there is no pipe and/or soap, etc. draining water from a hanging or pumpkin can with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in the country of construction. In case of a limited water supply such as other "reservoir water" (such as in schools or out-of-town areas of construction).
Tippipe is an easy-to-use technology that uses a jag suspended with a rope, and a foot-controlled lever to pour a little water over your hands and a piece of soap.
An important part of the hand cleaning process is effective hand drying, but there is debate about the most effective form of drying in a public water room.
More and more studies have shown that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryer found in most rooms.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, compared the level of cleanliness when using paper towels, warm air dryers and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips is found to increase by an average of 194% and in the palm of the hand by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer causes an increase in the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips by an average of 42% and at the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing and drying the hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the end is reduced on average by up to 76% and at the site of the hands by up to 77%. The Saintis also perform tests to determine whether the potential cross-contamination occurs from other water room users and the environment of the water room from each type of carpet.
The jet air purifier, which inhales air out of the unit at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 bsj), is capable of infiltrating the microorganism out of the hand and the unit and potentially contaminates other users of the room and the surroundings of the room as far as 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes are found in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers compared to paper towels for drying.
Washing hands using hand-washing cloths is an alternative option when traveling when there is no soap and water.
Alcoholic hand cleaners should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Washing hands for medicine has long been an obligation when Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis of Hungary discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There is an electronic device that warns hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found its use could lower the rate of infection.
Wash your hands in medicine for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to squeeze and rub each part of your hand.
The hands need to be rubbed together with the fingers inserted in a swivel.
If there is dirt under the nail, the fur brush can be used to dispose of it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, we need to rinse them well and soak them until dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, the paper towel should be used to cover the water (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again when touching the surface.
Washing hands in a health care environment is aimed at disposing of pathogenic microorganisms ("commons") and avoiding spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that poor hand washing is unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient, then spreading the microorganisms.
One study showed proper hand washing and another easy procedure could reduce catheter-related infection rates by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published one document showing standards for how to wash and rub hands in the health care sector.
Draft guidelines on hand sanitation by this organization can also be found on its website for public comments.
Relevant review has been conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and confirm the cleanliness of the hand, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/dissolved body
before the aseptic task, and
after the treatment of the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "cured" or "antimicrobial") gives the action of killing the hand-washing agent.
Such a killing action may be desirable before surgery or in a situation where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To 'wash' a person's hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a pipe that can be turned on and off without touching the fingers to the touch of the fingers and the other to the touch of the fingers.
All items of jewelry have to be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and lower arms so that the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A long period of time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, the water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back to the hand.
After finishing washing the hands, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and surgical clothes are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after treating sick people.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand washing comes from the first 20% washing, and very few additional benefits are obtained when the frequency of hand washing exceeds 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the rate of infectious disease transferred to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Compare rubbing hands with an alcohol solution by washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds, each showing that rubbing hands with antibacterial soaps is 6% more expensive than rubbing with alcohol reduces.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashing to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the spores of Clostridium difficile from the hands. Interventions to improve hygiene in the healthcare environment can involve education for employees on alcoholic and alcoholic handwashing, increase the effectiveness of the handshake.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health environments.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as an effective and important tool for achieving good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of an expected water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in the home, at school and at work make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior.
For example, in most suburban areas in Africa, hand-washing pipes close to any private and public toilets are very rare, although there are cheap options available to build a hand-washing station.
However, the low rate of hand washing can also be due to the embedded habits of a lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocacy for handwashing with soap can affect basic decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to carry out monitoring and evaluation.
A systematic review of 70 studies found an effective community-based approach to improving hand washing in the LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of the promotion of hand washing in schools was the "Three Star Approaches" for their patronage by UNICEF which encouraged the school to take steps.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one to the end of three stars,
Developing a hand-washing station can be part of a hand-washing promotional campaign to reduce illness and child death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness raising campaign that is trying to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, UNICEF has promoted the use of handwashing emoji.
Several studies have considered the effectiveness of the cost of washing hands thoroughly in the developing country in relation to DALY.
However, one review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is much more cost-saving than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as a newborn mother giving birth to a child or an injured soldier in a hospital – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand sanitation: the doctor from Hungary Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria's "Inpegger and Forence Nightingale".
At the time, most people still believe that the infection is caused by a rotten odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and infections related to health care led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more vigorously promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine fever in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness about in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "the right hand washing technique" are hung next to a hand washing sink in a public toilet and in an office building and airport toilet in Germany.
The phrase "washing someone's hands off" of something, means declaring a person's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share the involvement in it.
It originates from the Bible verse in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Macbeth by Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to wash imaginary stains, representing her guilt over the crimes she has committed and which she influences her husband.
It was found that, after remembering or rethinking unethical acts, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and appreciate hand-washing equipment more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a hangover are less likely to be involved in other payment "washing" actions, such as doing volunteer work.
Religion establishes hand washing for the purposes of cleanliness and symbolism. Hand washing symbolically, by using soapless water to wash hands, is part of the hand washing rituals found in many religions including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> faith, Hindus, Hindus, sects and sects of Islam. The Yad<0xC3><0xA1>yim sects in Judaism, the Lavabo sects in Christianity as well.
Hindus, Jews and Muslims are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Islam also require washing their hands before and after eating.
Controlling the workplace hazards of COVID-19
Occupational hazard control for COVID-19 is an application for occupational health and safety methodology for hazard control to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace hazard control depends on workplace and work tasks, based on risk assessments for sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors for any worker who may be exposed to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), work with a low exposure risk has minimal work contact with civilians and other co-workers, which basic infection prevention measures are proposed including hand washing and sickening, encouraging workers to sit at home.
Work with a risk of simple exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact with an unknown or suspected person who has COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in an ongoing community or international travel.
These include workers who have contact with public figures such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and some retail environments with high volumes.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures including ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, rinse guards, and having self-protection equipment in case of contact with people infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health care workers and carcasses who are exposed to known or suspected to have COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol production procedures on, or collect or control specimens from known or known persons.
The appropriate hazard control for these workers includes engineering controls such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure and self-protection equipment that fits the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may not be present to work because of illness, need to take care of others or fear of being exposed.
The pattern of trade may change, either in terms of the goods requested, and how to get these goods (such as shopping outside peak times or through past shipping or guide services).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas directly affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. Preparing and planning for an infectious disease response can be used as a guide to protection measures.
The plan addresses the level of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks including exposure sources, risk factors arising from home and community environments, and risk factors for each worker such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the necessary controls to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparatory plans and responses to infectious diseases may be subject to a national or sub-national plan.
Objectives for response to outbreaks include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at high risk for serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located has an impact on the response taken.
Hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control according to effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the latter is self-defense equipment.
Engineering control involves the removal of workers from work-related hazards regardless of the behavior of workers, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policy or procedure that requires the action of an employee or employer.
Self-protection equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of hazards to workers, properly installed according to suitability (cth respirator), used properly consistently, always inspected, maintained and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal work contact with civilians and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include washing hands frequently and thoroughly, encouraging workers to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics include closing when coughing and sneezing, providing tissues and other garbage containers, preparing for telework or work shifts if necessary.
The identification and expeditiously eviction of potentially infected individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers who have acute respiratory symptoms sit at home so that they are free from fever, signs of fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using medications that reduce fever or medications that cause extraneous or alter other symptoms.
According to OSHA, exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact at six feet (1.8 m) from people unknown or suspected to be COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 as a result of the recent transmission of COIDs or COVID-19.
This includes those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public, those who are in contact with the public and those who are in contact with the public.
Workers in this risk group rarely require the use of a respirator.
If a person falls ill on board the aircraft, the proper controls to protect the worker and other passengers include isolating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew to care for the sick person, and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to close the mouth and nose with a tissue.
The cabin crew needs to wear disposable medical gloves when treating a sick traveler or touching a potentially contaminated body fluid or surface, and may have additional protective equipment if the sick traveler has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items need to be disposed of in a biohazardous bag, and the contaminated surface needs to be cleaned and cleaned after that. For commercial shipments including cruise ships and other passenger ships, other symptomatic hazard controls include delaying travel in case of illness, isolating themselves and informing the centre of the accident.
Best of all, medical follow-up actions need to be made within the cabin of the displaced person. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or eliminate germs if the infected person has been inside the school building regardless of the spread of the community.
When there is minimal to simple community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field visits, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education and koir classes or dining in cafeterias, adding space between the tables, the time of arrival and return to symptom-based sequentials, restricting visitors to bed-based locations.
When there is a high dissemination in the local community, in addition to a social distance strategy, further school dropouts can be considered. The CDC considers the health risk of hygienics for members of power boosters who perform routine activities to be low.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with an individual who is confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians including proper self-defense equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers need to clean and defrost their belts and duty equipment before reuse with a spray or household cleaner wiper, and follow the standard operating procedures for the condensation and dismantling of PPE used and for laying and washing clothes.
OSHA considers health care workers and carcasses to be in a high or very high category for exposure risk.
High-risk work at risk includes the delivery of health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It becomes a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs aerosol-generating procedures on, or collects or controls specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
The work of the cadaver house includes workers involved in providing the cadavers of people known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of their death; it becomes a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering control for this risk group includes a segregation room for COVID-19 patients known or unknown.
Irrigation with special negative pressure may be suitable in some health care settings and cadavers.
The specimens must be controlled with the vigilance of Stage 3 Biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who will enter are evacuated to a different waiting area depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to the PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of their known, or suspected, aerosol patients.
In the United States, N95-approved face filter respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including fitness tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide higher protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend covering clothing because COVID-19 is an respiratory disease that is not spread through body fluids.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks for entrance examination staff.
For those who collect respiratory specimens from, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without an aerosol-producing procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protectors, or face protectors, protective clothing and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the global supply of PPE is not adequate, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, using only PPE that is necessary for the specific task, resuming the same use.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Relieves the burden and prepares for the future
DATE/MOST OFFER: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Note: CC0: No rights reserved.
We are in a very special situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our interconnectedness in the world and the responsibilities we have towards each other clear.
We don't have a challenge like this before, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of empathy, collaboration and community building that is in the midst of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have seen among all our coworkers via email, phone and spam is an extraordinary confirmation for the extraordinary human we are fortunate enough to be able to work together.
I am so grateful and proud to be your ally.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This reminds me of how much the world means now when it can refer to Wikipedia, and how much it becomes a symbol of power because this critical source remains online and available to all.
Your work makes all of this possible, whether you make sure your website stays active or your coworkers are paid or our community is safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, more so at the present time.
It's not just what we do but the way we do it, it's going to make a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Aligning our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c team met last night to discuss our approach and the schedule for the days and months to come.
In that discussion, we consider what we think will be a response to what we face and the best way to ensure this organization can survive at this time.
Together, we want to get rid of stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down a little, that's okay.
To all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week so it will be announced next.
We don't announce leave - if you can work on regular time, the mission can use you.
However, the world is now unpredictable. Whether you need to take care of loved ones, buy kitchenware or meet a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We won't take your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been told, but we did.
There's no need for a sick day or PTO - just let your manager know and help your team re-check the calendar and schedule to make sure the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure that you receive appropriate attention from the management.)
Those who are paid per hour will be paid in full.
We have communicated and reaffirmed our commitment to respect the commitments of our contractors and paid hourly staff members.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be so satisfying to us, especially in times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We just ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt it accordingly.
Some of the work is considered important.
There are some things we have to keep going.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security, and Fundraising teams (among them) do critical work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our mission.
There’s a lot to do for all of us, we’ll just focus on the most important project.
The crash now won't hurt later.
We do not plan to move "double times to pursue what is left behind" once this pandemic has passed.
You are not expected to work more time to meet the deadlines that are now unrealistic.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and will try to set new goals and timelines if necessary.
What Happens to the App (Annual Plan)?
To adapt to the realities and expectations of our daily working hours, we want to adjust our 2020-2021 Annual Plan delivery timeline.
Our desire to recommend further plans for 2019-2020 that allow more time for budgets to allow workers to prioritize critical work, self-care and care of their loved ones while helping those who need or want to work with reduced working periods for the next few weeks.
The extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and current planning pressures throughout the organization.
We will present our proposals to the Board next week and will inform representatives and teams of the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the team of App on your leadership in this regard.
Office Status, Exposure and Cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary step, we have hired an antivirus cleaning team to infect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus solutions to infect every surface as well as lobby and elevator systems that reach our levels.
The building uses its own protocol of care tasks in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We felt comfortable that the office would be well available when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which shares the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
As of last week, our DC officials switched to supplies far in full alignment with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some NYC-based co-workers know, we're also talking about rejuvenating one location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is ongoing but may be postponed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
A long-term employee for as long as we know that it can be a customization and would like to give you some advice:
Hold the meeting for an additional one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to split up for a few days.
Determine the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the reading material first.
Create default videos, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Having a chairman to control each meeting, someone to monitor conversations for questions and track the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or do note taking collaboratively).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable headphone.
Make use of your well-being allowance for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to talk to your co-workers about the tasks carried out
The HR Operations Team is looking at an ergonomic webinar guide to support the improvement in tasks carried out across the Foundation.
In recent weeks we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editaton so that the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions may be something that is impossible in preparing their approved grant activity and that no action will be taken due to delays or changes to those goals.
Next week we will be making follow-up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The common sentiment of the entire global community seems to be sadness at the disruption but feels relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and vice versa.
Moving forward, CRT strives to develop a single page about Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the coming Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and take some time to connect with each other.
We're together in this and we're here to help as much as we can.
For now, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will make sure all these pages are updated and all information is in one place.
We also strive to ensure regular communication with staff who are in a very impressed country at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or coverage challenges, or any help you need, don't hesitate to get in touch and work with CRT.
We are here to help in providing support and being a liaison if necessary.
If you have a difficult or sensitive issue, please e-mail Bryan Judan - Director of Global Operations International HR.
None of these changes should be seen as an omission from our work and responsibilities.
However, all of this is a recognition at this time, our work and responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way unlike the past.
These are steps that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our movement with the support they need, and the world services they can expect.
Our mission is to be there to wait for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important tasks that will come in weeks and possibly months to come.
We need you all to make it a reality, and we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you will be ready at the best stage when that need comes.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and those others in the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 faces the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) associated with reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a drug that can be expected to be targeted to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a center of entry into the cell for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is zinc that contains a metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 domain of N-terminal peptidase and the C-terminal colectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pathway type 1 membrane protein, with its enzyme domain actively exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of ACE2 cells is attached from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the soluble protein results are released into the bloodstream and eventually diluted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is contiguous on the membranes of most alveolus cell type II lungs, small intestinal enterocytes, arteries and venous endothelial cells and soft arterial muscle cells in most organs.
Expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebrospinal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a balancing agent to ACE.
ACE binds the hormone I angiotensin into the narrowing of the vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2 instead attaches phenylalanine amino acid carboxylic-terminal from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hydrolysis into angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-HO).
ACE2 can also bind to a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]- bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the distribution of SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transport membranes and is shown in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, binding to the protein S1 prefixes for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the enzyme domain on ACE2 over the surface of the cell resulting in endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosome located between cells.
The process of entry also requires the addition of S protein by serine prosthesis of the host TMPRSS2, a stain under current study as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing the level of ACE2 in the cell may help in fighting infection.
However, a variety of professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend to continue standard ACE disinfection and ARB therapies.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE dyes was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE stains who have a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE stains has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality rates, although the results are less stable than the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombination of human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen depletion in pigs with acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome of lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the action of the effect (tempo) over 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a drug that can be expected for those with intolerance to classical renin angiotensin system stains (RAS stains) or in diseases surrounding angiotensin II enhanced. rhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical studies for the treatment of respiratory syndrome.
The b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software application designed to help track relationships in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people ("relations") who may be related to infected individuals.
Many applications are developed or proposed with government officials supporting in some areas and areas of power.
Several frameworks for building relationship tracking applications have already been developed.
Privacy concerns are raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of users' applications.
Less disturbing alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity log on other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would merge functionality to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to check if they have ever had a relationship with those infected with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, one application called TraceTogether is in use.
The app was developed by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide prompt feedback to health care authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is pending approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the relationship tracking application is in an advanced development stage, and will be available to launch in a few weeks. A similar application was designed in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geolimited applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiency if application implementation is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of "coronavirus" apps that are confusing or dangerous, Apple has set a limit on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its Apps Store, limiting them to "authorities" alone or a well-known organization.
Google and Amazon have implemented the same restrictions.
The privacy campaigner voiced concerns about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure was created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organization declares eight conditions on government projects:
the supervision shall be "as far as the law is concerned, if necessary and proportionate";
the monitoring and monitoring shall have an enclosed clause;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
Data security and security shall be protected and demonstrated to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be avoided from further deteriorating discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in the law;
shall be protected against abuse and the right of citizens to provide information on abuse;
Involvement means that all "relevant stakeholders" should be needed, including public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The Google/Apple plan proposal aims to address ongoing monitoring issues by removing tracking mechanisms from their device operating system as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based tracking compared to apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have a huge potential privacy problem.
However, not all systems with a centralized server need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy retention systems have already been created that use a centralized server only for mutual communication (see section below).
In South Korea, one application-based system is used to perform relationship tracking.
Compared to using special applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and the merging of all these generates notifications via text messages to individuals who are potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also makes location information available to the public, something that is justified due to major changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany consider using a centralized system and privacy maintenance.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released yet.
Relationship tracking with privacy maintenance is a concept advocated with important body study literature starting from 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) to log user proximity on other mobile phones.
In any case, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and centralized approach, and not a single protocol. The centralized protocol includes the Monitoring of the Closeness of the Centralized Privacy Maintenance (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Other Aliinthful Contact Numbers (TCPAN), Temporary Contact Numbers (CPAT and DP-3T).
In this protocol, known personal data definitely never leaves the device, and all the markings apply to the device.
MIT Media Lab's Privacy Group is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy maintenance techniques when collecting and using location or cross-sectional data to track COVID-19 transmission.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The same effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology that is also based originally at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities, without affecting data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by several unified groups on equally important methods and large overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global operations for monitoring and warning applications, an important aspect for achieving widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had already made an open source for the BlueTrace protocol used by official government applications.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track relationships that they were accused of maintaining privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Power technology and privacy cryptography.
They also publish core technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system intends to be launched in three stages:
Launch of tools to allow the government to create a privacy-preservation coronavirus tracking application
The integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android plans of Google and Apple to deal with the ongoing implementation and monitoring problems by first deploying the system through the update of the operating system, and then removing it in the same way as soon as the threat passes.
Repositioning a drug (also known as changing the purpose of a drug, reprofiling, reassignment or therapeutic conversion) is changing the purpose of a drug approved for the treatment of different diseases or health conditions from the reason it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research efforts being carried out to develop a safe and effective treatment of COVID-19.
Other research goals include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of recovery plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 modified proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing the binding site provides an affordable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against the COVID-19 protein.
Most of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are proteases such as papain, RNA-dependent polymerases, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribophosphatases.
Hussein A A, et al. examined several candidate compounds that were subsequently optimized and analyzed for similarity to the approved drug to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in its preclinical study to be recommended in clinical trial design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York state trial on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use License (USA).
The treatment is not approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is allowed under the U.S. as only one experimental treatment for emergency use in patients admitted to hospital but may not receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC has said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said that they use the drug when "there is no other choice".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine with a combination of zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A major study is being conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the use of hydroxychloroquine prevention.
A Chinese clinical trial in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in over 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.

On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its storage and use the military to send the drug to a university hospital, which will use the drug to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe changed his stance against the Trump administration regarding the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of severe illness when the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those who are trying to get pregnant.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an antiviral combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, formulated that "no excesses can be observed".
The drug is designed to suppress HIV rather than mimic by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drug to find compounds that will bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteases. There is criticism in the scientific community about relieving sources to change the purpose of the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences further found that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
One issue with antiviral treatment is the appointment of barriers through mutations that can lead to worsening disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to obstruction. There are several clinical trials underway including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and another for those with worse illness.
There are three clinical trials underway for intravenous vitamin C for those hospitalized and very ill with COVID-19, two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York started a trial for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide), a susceptible corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with novel coronavirus.

The study, called COLCORONA, took 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not have effective contraceptives are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin with low molecular weight is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Combating Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centre study of over 300 patients investigated the use of enoxaparin sodium on a prophylactic and therapeutic dose was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, sufficient scientific attention has been focused on changing the purpose of the approved antiviral drug developed for outbreak purposes such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to China's 7th guideline
Umifenovir: Umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to China's 7th guideline
Some antibiotics are identified as potential goal changers as the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 Receptor): Approved by China.
Also trials in Italy and China, and see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although there are no vaccines that complete clinical trials, there are many attempts in progress to develop the vaccine in question.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in a Phase 1 safety study in April.
COVID-19 was confirmed in December 2019.
The spread of the world's major outbreaks in 2020, provides investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Declared in April, the imperative of the CEPI initiative for accelerated vaccine development, mining capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform aims to advance into the Phase I safety study include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase 1 Builder and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (Phase I constructor and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (regarded as being in planning or under construction).
Phase I-II trials performed early safety and keimunogenity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and multi-stage, while determining the effective dose more accurately.
Phase III trials typically involve more participation including a control group and the effectiveness of tests on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects on optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as of early April 2020), 74 are still not yet in human assessment) are still in "preclinical" research.
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular tightening vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune responses.

The vaccine development project was announced at China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, promoted by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had already started an effort in developing the vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with Vaxart, its biotechnology partner.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published papers on the design of vaccines with the same technology as that used for neoantigenic cancer vaccination therapy.

in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
These partners are further announcing plans for pre-clinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced it was working with 11 isolates that although on a proper track it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles under part of the funding of the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in a laboratory investigation, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac "a lot of money to get exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine", and the matter was opposed by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The candidate vaccine is based on mRNA BNT162, now in a preclinical trial while the clinical trial is expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced they would get a preclinical test decision in April 2020 and their last vaccine candidate could start human testing by fall.

Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing for six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-enhanced RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving vaccinations from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for research projects on medical prevention measures against COVID-19, including many vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiative.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced a special C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" out of several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a PittCoVacc test, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in rats, stating that "MNA provides a subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine that induces an initial active response of a potent, intravenous 2nd antigen specific antibody."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a candidate DNA-based vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
By using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to mimic human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered resources for supercomputer access from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits other than diseases that prevent them.
A randomized trial in Australia aims to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
There is a possibility of vaccines that are not safe or effective in development.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models such as transgenic rats ACE2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, shows the need for phase 3 biosafety restraint measures to control live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, no contraceptive or protective vaccine for SARS has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, there is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS is widespread, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that had completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others were running, all of them viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS).
Social media broadcasts encourage conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 has been known and one vaccine is already available.
Patents filed by various social media broadcasts refer to existing patents for genetic referrals and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms usually lasts five days but may begin between two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and regions, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 patients have recovered. This virus is especially spreading among humans during close relationships, often through small drops produced through coughing, sneezing or speaking.
While these drops are produced during inhalation, they usually fall to the ground or on the surface rather than become an infection for long distances.
People can also become infected by touching the contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
The most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the onset of the symptoms and in the next stage of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is with the reaction of the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (cRT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended to those who suspect themselves of carrying viruses and their guardians.
The restrictions on the use of masks by ordinary citizens are different, with some authorities recommending not to use them, some recommending their use and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or viral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease is recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or show symptoms such as flu such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Symptoms of anxiety include continued difficulty breathing, pain or chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and bluish face or lips; medical attention is advised immediately if these symptoms appear.
Unusually, upper respiratory tracts such as sneezing, watery nose or sore throat may be noticed.
Gastrous symptoms such as feeling tired, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in multiple percentages.
Some cases in China initially only show data congestion and palpitations.
In some, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may be between two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected patients show symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transplantation is still not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The rates of those infected do not show the symptoms are currently unknown and are being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic while staying in their hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Spices and saliva can carry a lot of load of viruses.
Talking louder releases more drops than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing not to close the mouth can cause drops to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not intrinsically present, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that the transfer of bioaerosols is possible and the accumulator of air in the corridors outside the public room shows a positive sample for the RNA of the virus.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory contraction into an aerosol and consequently lead to the spread of the innate.
Although there are concerns it spreads through the intestines, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is highly contagious when asymptomatic people; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is unclear as to how easily the disease spreads, one infects two to three people in general. The virus lasts for several hours until several days on the surface.
In particular, the virus is found to be detectable for a day over cartons, up to three days over plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours over 99% of copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products weaken the protective layer of virus fat, disabling it as well as freeing it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken for median for two days after the beginning of hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in Coronavirus-related naturally.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which leaks its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is almost related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the enzyme-transforming enzyme angiotensin (ACE2), the most abundant in type II alveolus cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a typical surface of a glycoprotein called a "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injuries were found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China and more often in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high, due to the reaction of systemic inflammation and immune system disease during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are very much in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High incidences of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with weak prognosis. The autopsy of those who died due to COVID-19 has found diffuse alveolus damage (DAD), and lymphocyte penetration contains inflammation within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for ACE2 expression epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperactivity symptoms.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF embedding T cells have been shown to correlate with the intake of monocytic inflammatory embedding IL-6 and severe lung pathologies in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltration has also been reported during autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rPT-PCR).
Tests are usually done on a breath sample obtained with a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nose swab or saliva sample may also be used.
The decision is usually made within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks away and the result has little immediate value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish genetic guidelines so that laboratories around the world can freely develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (possibly detecting an active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) is under development but is not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first start-up care test on March 21, 2020 for use by the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for infection detection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral multilobar glass decay with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution is common during early infection.
The dominance of subpleura, many suffocation (globulous septum thickening with multiple alveolus filling) and unification may occur when the disease progresses.
Some data can be found on monoscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytic, hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytic, inflammation-between with lymphocytic invasion and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: damage of the diffuse alveolus (DAD) with diffuse alveolus exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
recovering pneumonia: exudate preparation in the cavity of the alveolus and fibrosis of the pulmonary spaces
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC), leukoerythroblastic clot
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding people's places, often washing their hands with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using a part of the shoulder in the absence of tissue.
The proper cleaning of the hands after any coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of fabric face covering in public places, partly to limit transfers by asymptomatic individuals. The social prison strategy aims to reduce the relationship of people infected with large groups through school and workplace closures, restrict travel and cancel large public gatherings.
The prison guidelines also include for people who are at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from it.
No drugs are known to be as effective at preventing COVID-19. Since vaccines are not expected until as early as 2021, the main thing in managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of epidemics, known as "curves".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating or after inhaling their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is further recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol but only when soap and water are not provided. For areas that do not have commercial hand sanitizer, the WHO provides two recipes for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity appears from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help get rid of bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not the active ingredient for hand antiseptics".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other important affected organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they are carrying a virus to wear an easy face mask.
Oxygenation of the extracorporate membrane (ECMO) is used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but the excess is still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese Health Commission have published an outreach to keep those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Critical caregivers and pulmonologists in the U.S. collect treatment coverage from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no special treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health care professionals who care for those who are infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in the Infectious Disease Separation Room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautionary measures, precautionary measures for relationships and precautionary measures.
Recommended equipment is: PPE dress, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred.
The N95 respirator is approved by industry settings but the FDA has already authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use License (USA).
It is designed to protect against intrinsic particles such as dust but effective against special biological agents is not guaranteed for use outside of the label.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks or as a final choice, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe so it requires mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percentages require it.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related to respiratory failure is being actively studied for patients in hospital with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nostrils or two-stage positive airway pressure.
Whether these two give the same benefit to people who are critically ill is unknown.
Some doctors choose to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal cannulas. Severe cases are usually frequent in older adults (those over 60 years old and especially those over 80 years old).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to control the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of those put into a clean care unit, 2.3% needed mechanical fan support and 1.4% died.
In China, at least 30% of patients in hospitals with COVID-19 will be admitted to the ICU in the end.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) builds up in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans are capable of controlling the pressure and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury related to fans and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on fans longer.
Investigations for potential treatments began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears as the most expected.
Although new drugs may take time until 2021 to develop, some of the drugs currently being tested have already been approved for other uses already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people who have a serious illness.
WHO recommends volunteers take part in the efficacy and safety trials of potential treatments. The FDA gives temporary approval for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in cases for their serious or easily endangered lives.
It is not yet through the necessary clinical studies to show it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with outbreaks of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
This application can detect 'close recognition' using surveillance data and thus a potential infection risk.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk is potentially detected, the application not only recommends self-quarantine, it also warns the local health authorities. Big data analysis on mobile phone data, facial scanning technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence is used to track the infected and the person they are contacted by.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security agency to track the mobile phone data of those facing the coronavirus.
Steps are taken to enforce quarantine and protect those related to infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is implementing facial scanning technology to detect the perpetrators of the quarantine.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by the mobile operator that "40% of people continue to move everywhere."
The German government ran a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid called on the global for a creative solution to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience stress as a result of quarantine, travel restrictions, the effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "The increase in social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, pressures and economic turmoil is the perfect millennium that jeopardizes people's mental health and well-being."
The disease will cause mild effects with little or no symptoms, resembling a common chief's respiratory disease such as common bronchitis.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness take three or six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of getting a severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but the data for COVID-19 is less. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In most of those severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly spread to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal freezing and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal freezing, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, has been evident in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is observed in 4% of this group.
At least 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days allocated for hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median time of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In the initial case study, the median time from the appointment of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with full coverage of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathology examinations in post-mortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolus damage with exuded cellular fibromyosoids in both lungs.
Virus cytopathic changes are observed in pneumosis.
Pulmonary images show acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was observed with increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those admitted to hospitals with existing health conditions, the region's availability of medical and socioeconomic resources may also have an impact on mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality rates from conditions vary due to differences in their region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The low incidence of mild cases can lead to overbudgets for mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by past cases of infection can mean the current rate of death over budget.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 more likely to need proper care or die than non-smokers. Anxiety has been voiced about long-term follow-up of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some patients recovering from the disease, and lung scans suggest organ damage.
It may also lead to the syndrome after proper care following recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known if the previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity in those who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on other coronavirus behaviors, but in cases with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by positive tests for the coronavirus on a date that has been reported.
All of these cases are believed to be worse with prolonged infection than re-infection.
The virus is considered natural and originated from animals, through a pertussis infection.
The true origin is unknown but until December 2019 the overall transmission of the infection was almost all driven through human-to-human transmission.
One study for the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest onset date of symptoms is December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reports the early onset of symptoms is on December 8, 2019.
Several steps are usually used to measure the death rate.
These figures vary by region and by time and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the choice of treatment, the period since the initial transmission and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO established the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-accredited SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection without timely confirmation of a clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed laboratory of COVID-19.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate compared to global cases was 6.9% (153,822/240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed with the disease dying, and the infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals infected (diagnosis and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not subject to time and according to a particular population of infection until the resolution of the case.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of people infected.
In the centre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival parties, and transmission to younger people, causing a comparatively lower mortality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system is still not excessive.
In the Netherlands, at least 3% may have antibodies as assessed by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the rate of death varies for both men and women.
The higher mortality rates for men in the study were carried out in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is those in their 50s, with a gap between men and women constipating only at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The true causes of these sex differences are unknown but genetic factors and behavior may be the cause.
Immunological differences based on sex, a lack of smoking in women and men form joint morbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of people infected are male and 72% of those who died due to COVID-19 are male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked sex-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on both men and women.
The higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and they have a higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19."
WHO Chairman Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the abbreviation CO for coronavirus, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for outbreak time was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographic location (cth. China), animal species or population group, in line with international scrutiny for naming aimed at avoiding stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoRS-V).
In addition, the WHO uses the "covid-19 virus" and the "virus responsible for COVID-19) in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are usually referred to as "coronaviruses".
During early transmission in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases are usually referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and acute respiratory diseases 2019-nCoV as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in line with the 2015 guide to location use for disease and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers release health care materials such as nose swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needs a fan valve immediately, and the supplier cannot deliver it on the required time scale, one engineering beginner turns around locally and produces the 100 necessary valves overnight.
After the initial transmission of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incorrect information appeared regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread online quickly.
Humans have the ability to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral contamination in chickens, chickens and chickens.
No medications or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being undertaken by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "Solidarity Trial" to assess the effects of the treatment of four current antiviral compounds with the most expected effectiveness.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous efforts on SARS-CoV are being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers are aiming to build a viral vaccine as a whole.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at obtaining immediate immune responses in the human body to new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that is sensitive to the immune system in some virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the investigation focuses on the protein of the S-spot which helps the virus break through the receptors of the enzyme ACE2.
The third strategy is a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating one vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies need to be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Increased antibody dependency is proposed as a potential challenge for the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is a controversy.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials have already been approved as a treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The modified antiviral drug targets include most of China's investigations, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir for some countries to be reported by the end of April.
One review of clinical development dynamics for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is available, as of April 2020. Some antiviral drugs are currently being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir until March 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with the use of remdesivir lovingly.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in the U.S., China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria was previously studied in China in February 2020, giving an initial decision.
However, there is a call for a re-examination of the research equivalent.
The authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, admits that double the dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published a license for emergency use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine according to a medical expert’s speech treating those infected with COVID-19. China’s 7th edition guideline also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Initial data indicate that a high dose of ribavirin is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 secretion in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for further in vivo studies after showing low concentration inhibition in SARS-CoV-2. Studies show that the initial protein ingestion of increased proteins by serine protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with A2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that prevent the medical community from using this therapy without further study. Oseltamivir does not stain SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and no role is known in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the next stage of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has anticytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
He was undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing a positive result with a serious illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this means to fight those developments, which are considered to be the cause of death for some infected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid-aligned refractory cytokine release syndrome by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of antibodies to people who have recovered from COVID-19 is being investigated as a non-vaccine method for passive immunization.
This strategy was tested on SARS with no conclusive decision.
Viral neutralization is a mechanism of action that passive antibody therapy can be a defense mediator against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as possible cell toxicity of antibody dependency and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced are in development.
The production of recovery serum, which consists of parts of the blood fluid from recovering patients and containing antibodies specific to this virus can be improved for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
