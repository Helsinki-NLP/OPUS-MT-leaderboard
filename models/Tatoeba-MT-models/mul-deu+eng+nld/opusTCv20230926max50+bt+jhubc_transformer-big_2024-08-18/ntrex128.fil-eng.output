Welsh AM's fears of 'looking muppets'
Some who are afraid of several AMs in the bill should replace their title and become MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The city plans to change the name of the assembly and make it the Welsh Parliament.
People from all walks of life are worried that this could be a joke.
As an AM from Labour, their group is concerned that "it sounds like Twp and Pwp."
For readers not from Wales: In Welsh, twp and tae mean pwp.
An AM who came from Plaid said the group was "not happy" in general and they had already devised possible purchases.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about changing the name, but he also said the MWP was not far away from the word Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh and the letter u in Yorkshire English are similar.
According to the Assembly Commission, which is currently envisaging a law to replace the name: "Any final decision is subject to what the Assembly Members will be called to its own members as well."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received broad support to call the Welsh Parliament the assembly.
As for the AMs to be called, the Commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from the public consultation.
The AMs, on the other hand, provide for possible exchanges, but it may hurt Presidential Officer Elin Jones' head to agree on everything, which is expected to bring forward a bill in just a few weeks.
The child in the reforms will include other changes in the running of the assembly, including the rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs are the last vote on what to call them when they are already debating the law.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name
There will be a vote on whether to change the name of the country and make it the "Republic of North Macedonia."
This vote will be held with the will to resolve several decades apart from their neighbouring Greece, with its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours means that they own its territory and has repeatedly objected to its demand for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, who denounces the plebiscite by changing the name, does not want to respect the vote.
However, these supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, only in exchange for naming their membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Ghosts Are Quiet While Churches in Harlem
"In the past," said the elders I spoke with, "there was a bar and a church in every corner," said G. Adams.
"Now, there's nothing."
He said the loss of the bar is understandable.
"People are different in today's world," he said.
"It's no longer the people's fault the bars where people go all the time."
As for the churches, he feared it would not be as long as the chiefs expected the money to be obtained from the sale of the property, "in the long run they will also return to where they started."
He added that the lower floors of the apartment buildings could be replaced with condominiums full of types of people who could not help the remaining shrines of the community.
"Most people are white who buy condominiums in these buildings," he said, "so it will only speed up the day when these churches will be closed because people living in these condominiums will be far from being members of these churches."
White congregations built the same church before becoming a metropolis of blacks the Harlem - Community Metropolitan in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
Its title was taken by the black congregation worshipping near the building.
The black congregation endorsed St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of predators on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which opposed the reception or promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's customers made plans, they commissioned Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, called the carillon "the monsters of the bad guys".
The expert who played carillon in July called it different: "A cultural asset" and "an irreplaceable and versatile instrument."
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
G. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
The event at St. Martin's in its final months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which were entered by the non-ordained chiefs of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the ruler of the parish, consisting of unconsecrated heads - wrote to the diocese in July about the idea of "passing the expenses" of the diocese into the vestry, although the vestry had nothing to do with the reception of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers complained of a lack of loyalty in the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark smuggled for lobster in California
A shark attacked and caught a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he scrambled for a California lobster on the first day of the lobster season, harvest officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Ani Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, had a half-hour she whispered on Saturday morning with her friends when she heard a boy asking for help and she approached it with her group to bring her out to the water show.
Ani Hammel, she thought she was just excited about catching the lobster, but "I realized the kid was yelling, 'I'm sick!
I'm hungry!"
"It's as if he's in the middle of his neck," Hamlet said as he approached the boy.
"I beat all the waterfalls: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was rushed to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by airlift where he was listed in critical condition.
It is not clear what type of shark is responsible for the attack.
This lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles at a media meeting, saw a shark in the area a few weeks ago but it was not referred to as a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper part of his body.
Officials blocked sea-to-sea access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for exploration and for safety.
Giles said there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams using beauty aisles in the department store style with specialist assistants.
As an important part of entering the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and household clothing sales decline, it will try out larger beauty aisles at 11 stores across the country, and will increase next year's revenue.
Beauty investments are rising as supermarkets look for a way to fill the shelf spaces that were previously used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
With Sainsbury's, they'll double the size of their beauty sales by up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also receive additional branded space as seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also reintroduce its Boutique makeup products to be in favor of vegans most of what it has underwhelmed - something that is demanded by an increasing number of younger consumers.
In addition, Sainsbury's retailer Fragrance Shop will try to sell at two stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
Shopping online and buying a small amount of food every day at local convenience stores has led supermarkets to make more effort to get people to visit.
This Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, will be more face-to-face with department stores as the supermarket chain fights off discounters such as Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's puts Argos' outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since they bought the same chain two years ago, which they say has contributed to increased grocery sales and led to an increase in revenue from the company's listed products.
The last attempt of the supermarket to change their beauties and pharmacy department was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ceased after having an argument on how to cut revenue from its chemist's stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sale of their <0xC2><0xA3>125m business pharmacy with 281 stores in Celesia, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
She said Lloyds had a role to play in the plan by adding products from luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty aisle to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in staff with specific training and are willing to provide advice.
"Our brands have been designed to meet every need, and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean we're people's top destination for improvement that challenges a more relaxed way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby retires on <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den's widow Peter Jones has withdrawn from TV presenter Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with his business lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer had time for Truly, their brand of home appliances and accessories.
The business of said pair is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning's show host, 37, announced on Instagram his departure from the business.
Holly Willoughby has attracted Dragons Den's widow Peter Jones to a sudden withdrawal from their growing lifestyle brand business - to focus on her bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was "angrily angry" when the TV's golden girl admitted to a heartfelt meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of their spectacular business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that he had no more time for his "Truely," their brand of home appliances and accessories.
This business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would actually double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram his departure from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to go to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, "Right now, Really is Holly's top priority.
That would be his long-term future that will follow him over the next few decades.
Everyone was very surprised by his remarks.
No one can believe what's going on on Tuesday, yet it's too close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products in Marlow HQ ready for sale."
Experts believe the company will lose millions to the departure of This Morning's performer, who is one of Britain's most eminent personalities, due to large investments in products from pillows and candles to household clothes and equipment, and to the potential delays in delaying.
And it can serve as the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin with three children were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started True with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity by ITV.
A source close to Jones said: "We are not going to comment on his business affairs."
"We're friends and then we're friends"
He joked about the criticisms he would receive from the news media because of comments that might be "unpresidential" and because of being very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump's remarks about the "news anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He placed Kim interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
Discussions about denuclearization have been delayed.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see "equivalent action" from the U.S. on what they were doing to reduce weapons.
Instead, he vowed, the U.S. would continue to tighten its grip to maintain retaliation.
Trump's speech at the rally was more positive.
"We are in a good position in North Korea," he said.
"We should have fought with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a very good relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to release hostages, and bringing home the lips of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual way of telling stories about Kim's relationship.
"It's often easy to stand up like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this thick arena, we have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the people directly in front of him.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami hit the island, dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has lost residence, there is no declared national emergency, a prerequisite for inciting aid from other countries.
"Many times, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for help from other countries, so it's a bit difficult," said Bb. Confucius.
While the team is forming Save the Children to go to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreigner may be able to work in the area.
Ani G. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, Indonesian officials are still investigating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia is experiencing, they are not yet ready for natural disasters.
Although there are tsunami shelters built in Aceh, they are not commonly seen on other coasts.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although there is an existing warning, is also likely to be reduced by lives.
In the best of times, the journey between the islands of Indonesia can be tried.
Natural disasters are further aggravated by logistics.
An optional ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is currently going to Palu, but will be reached at least three days before the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's west-facing infrastructure a hub in his election campaign, and has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is being punished by the lack of funds for his impending re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced resentment from the remaining sectarian sects in Indonesia, where most of the Muslims clung to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands lost their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other age-old weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League third-place finish against Chelsea when he finished in the 89th minute of the game on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge's Xherdan Shaqiri was hoping for about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal as his team bounced 1-0.
He won the ball before being thrown to the far post of the goal.
The ball flew over the top of the box and flew it over the top right corner of the net.
Later, the ball fell into the net behind sinking Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"It's just the right position, to get the ball and players like Shaq are always trying to play as much as possible, so I'm just trying to take all the time I can," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming so I did a kick and I didn't think much about it and I just threw the tiara away."
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 in the halftime after finishing 25th minute off Belgian Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he went to the midfielder and rushed to Liverpool's side on the field.
Kovacic was fast-paced in the midfield.
He planted a bowl through ball, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard cut the defense and he sat with his left foot in the net with the far post just past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll at 832
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death toll has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the wreckage of the building due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday that caused waves that reached 20 feet, harvesting Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a staff spokesman, at a news conference.
The ruins of the collapsed buildings spread out in the City of Palu, with more than 380,000 people.
A man, 32, suspected of being raped and murdered by a woman, police arrested
An investigation into the shooting was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55am at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police had already urged anyone in the area to approach them who had seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "The investigation has just begun but I am calling on anyone on John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard any suspicious contact with us.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can get any footage on the dashcam to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesperson from Birkenhead confirmed the woman was found and was inside a property.
That afternoon, friends came to think they knew the woman to ask where she had found her this morning.
Investigations continued as police said they had notified the incident to close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews attempted to enter his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told to wait a few hours before they are allowed to enter again.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A young woman came to the area.
He repeatedly said that it was "smooth."

Cromwell's retaliation of Parliament's latest threat targeted by the fight to 'change history'
It was justifiable to eradicate it because of its disastrous Taliban destruction of England's vast cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its Puritan adherents.
But the Cromwell Society described G. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "planning to change history."
Ani John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society: "It is inevitable in the current debate about removing retaliation that Oliver Cromwell's image will be the target outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the destruction of sacred images during the civil wars in England.
Cromwell may have been the victim of what his great-grandfather Thomas did in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent creation of Cromwell's opinion in the 19th century and part of the study of the history of a man believed by many to still deserve to be celebrated.
Ani G Goldsmith in The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more than the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against oppression from the outside, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
There is still a debate on whether this is an accurate description in general.
It is only for certain that the mid-17th century celebration shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a unique figure who represented an aspect of that achievement.
It is also worth celebrating and remembering his achievements as Lord Protector."
Chinese Farmer's Slaughter of the Slaughter of a Man
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead and with a severed artery, lying near a pig's cage in a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig keeper is preparing to inject a pig vaccine in a pig on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, he was found dead by his cousin, and an open door was discovered near the pig's cage.
He said there was a large pig with blood in its mouth inside the cage.
A forensic analysis has confirmed that the farmer has lost 550 pounds, according to the report.
"Lift and turn the legs of my cousin," her cousin, who is only known by her surname "Wu," told Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera video showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
Yuan or his cousin did not own the animal that killed the man.
Here a market manager in the Evening News, the pig was detained for not being attacked, as police seized evidence on the spot.
According to the report, there were negotiations between Yuan's family and the market authorities for payment after his death.
Although rare, there have been cases that have previously been recorded by pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig approached a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife was afraid to keep the animal away.
After his pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive but could serve as a "pull" to them the taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They like to bite, they're too revealing... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to give them a lot of respect," he said.
The remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive and heavy rainfall to the southwestern U.S.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa has weakened as it heads to cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding and rainfall throughout northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa's wind speed is 85 mph, which is a Category 1 Hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and it is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a forming trough over the Pacific Ocean and it moves eastwards to the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humid northwards to the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humid conditions will result in the upcoming trough of heavy rains in the Southwest in the coming days.
In the locality, dangerous flooding, flooding of debris, and desert landslides will cause 1 to 4 inches of rainfall.
Deep tropical moisture will cause regeneration of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
About 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is not good to go out and walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rains.
The canyons can become wet rivers due to heavy rain, and storms with a swarm of local strong winds and dust suffocation.
Local heavy rains will bring near-depression to some parts of the coast of Southern California.
Regression is possible to reach a total of more than half an inch, which can lead to a slight flow of debris and dirt roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during its rainy season.
Several torrential rains will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rains spread on Monday and Tuesday night.
Heavy rains in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, in October there will be dramatic temperature fluctuations across the U.S., while the tropics will remain relatively warm.
At times, this causes severe changes in temperature over close distances.
There is a good example of a significant difference in temperatures throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between the city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to grow and expand again.
There is expected to be a warm beginning of October with the 80s widening most of the central and eastern U.S., from the Southern Plains to some parts of the Northeast.
New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is significantly higher than 10 degrees in practice.
Our long-term weather report says the high probability of higher than normal temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people, listening to Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed a shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused him of sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political battle continued, with broadcasters delaying the regular program for Friday's final blast: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation into the FBI's cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had shot him drunk and he tried to break him up in a high school party.
In a warm testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
It was probably over 20.4 million people that Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company counts the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers did not immediately become available for other networks that released it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has a problem with the number of people watching in offices.
For the sake of clarity, this is equivalent to the number of viewers playing the football game or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, where hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's dedication, led the networks, with approximately 5.69 million viewers throughout the day listening, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
There are 1.3 million CBS, there are 2.94 million NBC, there are 2.89 million MSNBC, and there are 2.52 million CNN, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a main character in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he was in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS got him on Friday morning cheered by protesters as the elevator escort went to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stood up with his eyes down as he was insulted for many minutes, and released it live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?
She said, "You have power while many women are powerless."
Before the elevator closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement, which at the hearing of the committee he would say more.
It was announced live a few hours after all cable and broadcast networks had ended, as the Judiciary Committee had to step down to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for this vote.
However, Flake said he would do so only because of his understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which have been pushed by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was slightly convinced of the conversations they had with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and many other senators, Flake formed a passion.
Flake's passion was powerful, as it was clear that Republican votes could not reach Kavanaugh's approval without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'politics' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politics" in Britain's future and undermining the country's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to May on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "his negligence."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested, and detained in the second-degree murder case, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials of the fight between Sims and Simpson released a video and the police said that Sims had lost his mirror in the fight.
Police picked up the mirror on the scene and said they saw Simpson's DNA here, reports WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bill was set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The Coroner's Office of the East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to this, the cause of death was a head shot that penetrated the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting the investigation prompted by the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law students for its "effort and pursuit of justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
Baton Rouge grew up 6-foot-6 forward, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you always remember," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Homes south of Mexico's capital have been flooded by the Popocatepetl volcano.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to move away from the volcano after increased crater activity and to register 183 air and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center monitors a lot of noise and tremors.
Social media footage shows thin ash wrapping up car windshields in areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noted an increase in volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 kilometers) away southeast of the capital after a 7.1 indentation in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano has been called "Don Goyo" since 1994.
Police clash with separatists in Catalonia before the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined the opposition movement to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's violent vote in the crackdown.
The egg and powder paint of a group of corrupt pro-separatists stabbed riot police to stop them, and it made black dust clouds on the streets usually full of tourists.
Evening riots also broke out and the police used guns to control the fighting.
For many hours the pro-independence groups called "No forgetting, no forgiveness" in front of the unionists protesting shouting, "Spain will live."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local newspaper reports.
Tensions remain high in the region calling for independence after a year of referendum on October 1 which Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters were chosen to vote independently although the vote was limited because the majority of those opposed to the vote withdrew the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in precincts across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to stop the action supporting the national police.
The action continued but was forced to go through another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer relied on the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year, we had one of our greatest moments.
"I was happy to see my parents because they voted, but we're not going down now," he said.
Although the hectic victory in the regional elections last December was achieved, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have struggled this year because of being exiled or imprisoned and are waiting to hear many of their celebrities for their role in organizing the referendum.
Ani Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on her phone a protest supporting the police, which politicians on both sides are organizing.
"Just remember that," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the late part of last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
"Being an election candidate in Europe is the best way to address the renunciation of democratic principles and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Three men, ages 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
It may also appear that there is a crossbow in the car.
Menga's streak, wins Livingston against Rangers, 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal confirms Livingston's victory
Livingston reported the Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his second three in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's tie was necessary for Gary Holt's team to die in the Hiberian in the second.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in the Premiership this season and they will face the leading Hearts who beat them eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers would contest Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their three-way play in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still undefeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Lost Opportunity Against Brushed Visitors
Holt's team should have been in the lead for a long time before they reached, if not for their directness that caused problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson passed, but tried to score, and Alan Lithgow's streak went away because he was met by Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts were happy to play the Rangers in front of them, because they knew they could harass visitors at set points.
That's how the important goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free-kick and took the opportunity to Livingston, collaborating with Declan Gallagher and Robinson to take care of Menga, who got the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
At that point, the Rangers got the ball but they struggled to penetrate the defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly only had a little difficulty,
This play continued in the second half, although it had to force Alfredo Morelos's save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow lived away from another set play of Livingston.
Movings on the Livingston side continued to occur and also continued to be pushed, as two penalty claims - ending Halket's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were suspected.
"Wonderful" from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
"It's a great game and a great result for Livingston.
In one person, they are good, constantly exceeding the expectations of higher development.
Their style of play and character hasn't changed much since they were once again the best, but great praise should go to Holt for his push to the team since he arrived.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was good, led the organized defense, while Menga suffered Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Whatever they came from under Gerrard, they didn't meet those standards.
Their last ball was missing - they only opened their side once - and it seemed like a call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ranks.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's reaction in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to settle relations between NATO allies.
They argued about human rights issues, freedom of the press, and Turkey's rise in the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
In this city lives the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police condemned the security to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurdish - also called for Erdogan's police and the German government's willingness to accept him in the country.
The two different protests reflect the divisive visitors who are considered to be the hero of some German Turks and are ousted as dictators of others.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died after a car crashed in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working on the identification of the man and the notification of his relatives.
There have been road closures and various bus lanes and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Trouble
Six prison officers were injured in trouble in the men's high security prison, the Prison Office said.
The rioting at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire started at 09:30 BST on Sunday and it is currently continuing.
Specialists "Tornado" officers were sent to confront the riots, chanting eight prisoners and keeping them in one wing.
Officers were on the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "There have been recruited special trained personnel to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for the injuries.
We do not empty the violence in our premises, and we make it clear that those responsible will be brought to the police and may be imprisoned for longer."
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the precinct had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, incarcerated rioting officers were called in to address a serious unrest in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens sudden flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Wetlands Can Benefit)
Tropical depression is rare for Arizona, but that could happen in the early part of next week due to the passage of the residual strength of the Rose Hurricane in the Desert Southwest, carries the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona has already released a follow-up to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, along with the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it is approaching Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix cited in a tweet that "only a dozen tropical storms have maintained a tropical storm or depression state 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with twenty-six inches of rainfall in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to gain 1 to 2 inches, possibly with a twenty-seven total of up to 4 inches.
For those not at risk of sudden flooding, the Rose rain can be a blessing because the region is dry.
While seriously considering the flooding, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the Southwest is currently experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 40 percent of Arizona suffers from severe drought, the second highest in the category," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Still with the storm's force and the fastest wind of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Hurricane Rosa is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered cooler waters in the Pacific and was instantly devastated.
It is expected to land in Mexico with a strong tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall can be severe in some parts of Mexico, with a high risk of flooding.
"We expect a total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall in Baja California to northwestern Sonora, which is likely to reach 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa in Mexico would then go as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border by early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which would then pass through Arizona as far as southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected in Rosa or its lip is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and in the U.S. Desert Southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden flooding and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested in attempted murder
Three teenage men and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old man was found with traps in Somerset.
A teenager man was injured at the Excelsior Terrace site in Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials appeal to anyone who has footage of what happened on the phone to show up.
Kavanaugh 'disturbed' by 'cruelty, anger' by the Democratic Party, Trump says
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to dismiss the Democratic Party's brutal and violent tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "tortured" by the Democratic Party "of cruelty, of anger" in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified in Congress on Thursday, forcing and emotionally denying the accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that she had raped her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford has also testified to the hearing of his accusations.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's comedy and quality and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most powerful brains in the law of our time, a jurist with a mechanical history of public service," he said at a rally in West Virginia.
The President cited Kavanaugh's nomination as speaking about the amount of Republican vote in the midterm elections.
"It's only five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not going to run, but I'm going to run," he said.
"So wherever I am, the good candidate is fighting."
Trump said the Democrats' mission was to "fight and prevent."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death toll is expected to rise
Approximately 384 people were killed, most of them in the wake of the storming of giant waves on the beach, when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi sank and sank, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a party in the city of Palu on Friday when stretches of up to six metres (18 ft) in the eclipse hit the beach, since most of their deaths and destroyed all of its passages.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of the tsunami rose yesterday, people were still carrying out activities on the beach and did not immediately leave and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency, BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"Not without the tsunami, it hit the cars, houses, it hit everyone on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami hit the sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the beach.
Others climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have fled to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs showed that the disaster agency had released a number of damaged buildings and shops, bend and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to sound the town on the beach on Saturday.
2.4 million people have been affected by a series of earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technologists (BPPT) said that the energy emitted by a major earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, positioned at the end of the long and narrow bay, could reinforce the strength of the tsunami," it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of the other victims were found trapped under the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the beach 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "overall was cut without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers would go to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The agency was widely panicked on Saturday because they did not report a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived in time to warn.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building was shown shouting fears of approaching tsunami warnings to people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall hit the beach, since the buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power loss that cut off communications around Palu, and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but food evacuations and other basic needs were still needed.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises over 800.
It's very old.
As the World Vision staff arrives safely in the city of Palu from Donggala, where the employees stay on the tarpaulin bridges built on the yard of their pavement, they see scenes of road damage, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even though aid groups have already begun the sluggish start of disaster relief, some have complained that foreign aid workers with strong skills are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, equipment, and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster area has been declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This disaster is only at the southern level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government has said, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we will be open with the help of other countries but no situation at this time."
By the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones will be miraculously arousing the depressing stories of national disasters.
On Saturday, there was a boy drawn from an imburnal.
On Sunday, the rescuers removed a woman who was trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that finished in the first half of this month in Indonesia.
Some of the adherents to the Roa Roa Hotel, including G. Mandagi, were his students.
"As I grew older in the field of paragliding, I had my own emotional burden," he said.
G. Gendon recalls that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread across the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu players, who were involved in the beach celebration.
But his messages only resulted in a color check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I don't think the messages were sent," he said.
Thieves, $26,750 raised as Newport on the Levee ATM refills
On Friday morning, the robbers raised $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled the contents of the ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver's contents removes an ATM from the entertainment complex and prepares to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was busy, there was another man "running from behind the character of Brink's" and stole a purse of money to be delivered.
Many witnesses were convicted of fleeing the scene, according to the release, but the police did not specify the number of defendants involved in the incident.
Contact anyone with information about their identity with the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper's name will be changed to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name - to Ye.
In his announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "What Kanye West once recognized."
Ye has long nicknamed West, aged 41, and used the title as the title of her eighth album, released in June.
The change was preceded by his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the show's singer Ariana Grande who has cancelled due to "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Apart from the spread of his current prophetic name, West had previously said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' means it," West said in the first part of this man's discussion of the title of his album on radio host Big Boy.
"If it's you, it's us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means being alone, to being Ye - being just a mirror of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, all.
The album is more about who we are."
He was one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced the popularity of the names Love and Brother Love.
Satisfied with whether or not the name was suffocated and capitalized by former West collaborator JAY-Z.
Mexico pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez pledged never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never be used to control Mexican citizens."
Troops of soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on Oct. 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed during the ravages of leftist student movements across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican children by providing monthly aid to students and opening up more public schools.
He said that the lack of employment and the lack of opportunities for education are driving young people into criminal groups.
U.S. funding should be doubled to A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments after making announcements about AI were made by various parts of the U.S. government, although the U.S. lacked the formal AI strategy as a whole.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it intends to become the No.1 in AI change by 2030.
"The doubling of the AI research budget is a good start, as the U.S. has greatly abandoned all other countries, and we are looking for the next AI success," Lee said.
Doubling the chance of funding in the U.S. could make the next big AI victory, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who authored the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worried about an AI system that defeated Otherllo's best American player, and then, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would take place, to help identify future visionaries.
Oftentimes, U.S. researchers have to make an effort to get help from the government," Lee said.
"It's not China that gets the top academics; if not corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other luminaire technology companies have taken luminaires from industries to work in AI over the years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy would help the U.S. to strengthen its efforts on AI.
"In my opinion, green cards should automatically be offered to those with PhDs in AI," he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people and academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to researchers from the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In the first part of this year, the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include colleagues from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
Regarding the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen by U.S. law seeking to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence within a few months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name in a referendum
Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, a move that could regulate the decades-long gap between them and Greece that hampers its desire to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists on claiming in its territory the name of its neighbouring country to the north and rejects Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist counterparts argued that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the turnout would reach the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to take effect.
This is the promised ballot question in the referendum: "Do you favor being a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth the effort to join groups such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am going today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not covered by the law, enough members of parliament said they would follow the vote result to confirm it.
The change of name required a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary election where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko, voted for a referendum in Macedonia on the renaming of the country that could pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and pulling seats in front of tents arranged by boycotts in the referendum.
"We're like NATO and the EU, but we want to join high-ranking and not enter the gate of the slaves," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that "evidence of our future" would be the "yes" result.
A vote published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters participated in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
In another poll conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, 57 percent of the responses were scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they were "yes."
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be 50 percent and then a turnout.
The failure of the referendum was the first major blow to the Western government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City, Brighton's full defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling pitched Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the game easy in his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the series.
He intercepted between three Brighton defenders, before hitting the open field.
After that, Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green clothes.
He pushed a defender ahead of the run a few more at the end of the Brighton box.
He then climbs to his left and finds Sterling.
English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball to Aguero, who in turn used his right foot to hit Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with a streak on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have achieved that goal at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues an opening victory in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball while in the depths of Brighton territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful through ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a few touches before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward grabbed the ball into the net before kicking off the border.
City defeated Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as a spoiler vs. Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But all-time defender Scherzer hopes to take the mound position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but that's if the Rockies still have implications in the playoffs with a win against the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Anyway, the Rockies took a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still hopes to secure their first title in the division.
"Even if we're playing for the left, we can hit the mound, anyway, knowing that feeling here in Denver, with the community and the other team, is probably the highest level of any point I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce the starter for Sunday, but they have been reluctant to allow Scherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday to make his 34th start, and pitch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander was 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's return to West Virginia
The President did not explicitly refer to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican results in midterm elections.
"Everything we've done in November.
It's just five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running so I'm afraid to fight the good candidates," he said.
Trump added, "You see this terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see it happening today.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see evil, poverty.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they should be fighting to get the power and control, power and control they want, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, had a "counter and prevent" mission.
"And you see that in the last four days," he said, as the Democrats called it "an angry and stubborn and greedy and lying."
He cites the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received powerful eulogy from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you release the document?
Ah, ah, yes.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The church is no longer a large church.
It is no longer accepting those who express their thoughts
When Momentum activists voted in my local party to impeach me, it was no surprise.
If so, I'm the last in the line of Labour MPs who said we weren't accepted - all because of the statement we were thinking.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because he was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship petition condemned me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, which in theory are similar issues in which Jeremy disagrees with past leaders.
The reminder for the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, GC meetings are like that every Friday night.
Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of "more understandable, more gentle" politics, if it really ever began.
It became more plausible that opposing views in the Labour party were not allowed and each opinion was judged on whether it was acceptable to the party's superiors.
It started the moment Jeremy became chief, as my colleagues first began to expect me to have a similar political outlook and take positions I had never agreed to - whether in national security or in the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there is a next stage of abuse on social media that calls for deselection, criticises middle-class politics, and says I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not all my experience.
True, I know I'm even more fortunate than some of my colleagues because politically motivated comments are directed at me.
I admire the prowess and determination of peers who face confrontational sexist or racist abuse every day but never escape.
One of the most disappointing aspects of politics of this era is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour party should protect the culture of reception.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "confidence" petition or change in election policies, the party becomes more narrow.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years that I've been urging myself to just bow down, not talk too much, and then, "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I want to do with my politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, which aroused a feeling of neglect by Thatcher's government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school to be literally devastated, I have tried to advocate locally for better public services or for those who have been more generous.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be mistaken in any way about the positions of my policy and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
"To those who advanced the petition on Friday, all I want to say is, when the country is intruding into a Brexit that will harm our households, our economies, and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my allegiance to the leader of the Labour party."
But, in fact, a message I have is not in the Nottingham Momentum, if not in my representatives, whether a member of the Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats of deselection or political expediency will prevent you all from acting in any way whatsoever.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ascension to the highest point of the untimely Ayr
The final two tests have also turned off the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win the amazing and entertaining match of the Tennent Premiership day.
They are now at the top of the table, the unique undeveloped side of the ten.
In the end, their unique defense, as their better chance, brought home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've tried our games so far, and we still haven't lost, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "What's good at Ayr, they've had better luck than us."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, which was released for the Warriors game, gave Melrose permission to finish and Jason scored an undefeated Bacon.
Climo broke Ayr's lead in a penalty, before, exactly in half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 in Ayr's break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt reduced, with Baggot converting only five points.
Thereafter, there was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruairidh Knott, released by the stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr advanced with Stafford McDowall's attempt to convert Climo.
A yellow card is given to Ayr's standing captain Blair Macpherson, and again, Melrose allows the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the ridge of fierce force.
However, the home side returned and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down behind the advancing Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregory Henry away for the fifth try of the home side.
The game still seems to be ready for a new career in the food industry.
Still Game's widow, Ford Kieran, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry, after it was discovered that he was named director of a licensed food company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his long-term comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be late for the show's run, and Kiernan seems to be planning for a post-Craiglang life.
According to the official listing, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though the Scottish Sun reporter suggested that Kiernan seemed to want to be part of Glasgow's "great restaurant trade."
'To us the sea': landlocked Bolivia, hopes to reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a naval pile of rigging envelopes in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a flag as blue as the sea.
The wetlands from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon spread the saying: "We have the sea according to the law.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost due to Chile's defeat in a bloody 19th-century struggle with natural resources - such as a desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
Those aspirations are at perhaps the highest level in several decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the World Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"There is a spirit of unity, and security in Bolivia, and it hopes, of course, with a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, full of hopes that the tribunal in The Hague will welcome Bolivia's demand that - after decades of bitter talks - Chile be obliged to agree to give Bolivia a free will.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year - also has a lot of things to do with the decision on Monday.
"We're about to return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some critics believe that there is little chance of a court ruling in favor of Bolivia - and little will change if this happens.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to dispose of Chilean territory, and it has agreed that it will not decide on the consequences of possible talks.
The case was "uncomplicated" based on the arrival of the ICJ's decision just six months after hearing the final arguments, said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in global law.
And far from the progress of Bolivia's fighting, it may have been prevented by the past four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric weakened any remaining goodwill of the Chileans, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the notion that the speed of court decision was unusual.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a rare opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139 people who do not understand when both sides benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it is able to maintain its confidence in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to continue the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's resumption of nuclear diplomacy began after a summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un more than three months ago.
Ri said it was a "great dream" to knee North Korea by continually imposing sanctions and opposing the U.S. in a declaration ending the Korean War.
Washington has warned against agreeing to the declaration that Pyongyang has not yet taken significant steps to reduce its armaments.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are both looking forward to a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about the use of weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris unveiled the latest line of big headwear that is about to be released on a High Street near you.
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover the sun, don't look for anyone else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have released a range of unique men's headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway so the style set at Paris Fashion Week has been amazing.
This summer, these designers have brought their intriguing creations to the catwalk with them.
Valentino's unique piece is a truly unique beige hat decorated with a wide bird-like brim that surrounds the heads of models.
Other great decorations include a flashy wand, a wizard's hat and also a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head from getting cold.
Thom Browne also exhibited a selection of strange masks suitable for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have Hannibal Lecter's lipsticks and are more similar to that of haute couture.
There is a creature similar to a scuba diving gear with snorkel and goggles, while there is another one that looks like a cone of melted ice cream.
If you're going to keep up with this amazing fashion statement, you're in luck.
Predict the style watchers, soon to release large bonnets on the high streets near you.
The arrival of the masculine hat following 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-legged brim and seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski, was timed.
The cult label behind the excessively impractical hat spread on social media has sent yet another large creature on the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw that's almost as big as the swimsuit model with it.
The colored burn orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringing and accompanied by a white leather handle, is a unique piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I hope to see the arrival of big hats and beach bags on the high street next summer - because of the size of the impression the designer has made, it's hard to ignore the demand for big accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills that are important to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain the track record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with the help of another body of excellent exam results, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in different parts of Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to its students and their parents.
The goal of the independent schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, in their chosen career and place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that designs and implements a proper curriculum in the school, we see modern languages continue to be popular and given a choice topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to a person with the language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it will enter his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we should not just rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is the leading in league tables with the highest rate of pass to independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who study foreign languages have earned a Higher Grade A.
The data, which was collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students earned a Higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spaniards were.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are exporting foreign languages as important skills that young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today's languages, as a topic of choice, are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, it was found that among the reasons given by employers for poverty to fill vacancies, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming especially necessary in order for young people to be prepared for their future careers.
Along with increasing potential job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever a person's chosen career, if he or she learns a second language, he or she will have an advantage in the future due to having such a lifelong ability.
People who speak multiple languages will automatically have the advantage because of their ability to communicate directly with people from other countries.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent lacked the ability to speak a foreign language and only French was spoken with a two-digit percentage, which was 15 percent.
This is why it is important for young people today to invest in language teaching.
Having the ability to speak many languages, especially in developing economies, will give young people a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools are different when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schools will be taught in more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK when the year 2020 is implemented, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there is always a language choice in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are focused on providing an environment suitable for teaching that prepares young people and gives them the skills needed to be successful, regardless of what happens in their future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in the area of global business, that language knowledge remains important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Without a doubt, modern languages should be considered as "the ability to communicate with the world."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and efficiency for the youth of Scotland .
We have to do it right.
John Edward the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Soon after the fans' wait ended, they hope to see LeBron James' start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's longer than a minute but less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that the minute James was likely to be destroyed was limited.
Following the rehearsal in the early part of the week, James was asked about his plans for six games on the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump is set to launch a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including visits to allied areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote awaits his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to hold hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been tense about charges of bribery while holding the Senate's expected confirmation vote for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of the blow of these rallies will help to get momentum for Republicans to face tough elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week will focus on "activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president goes to as many states as possible as we go to a busy campaign season," said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling is scheduled for the rally tonight and it can deliver supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get a report from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday it would be the second time in last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is caught in the ballot.
"It's not a good signal for Morrisey to have to go to the president to try to strengthen him in the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to keep hope for Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may need this Ryder Cup.
A fully invented concept in the field of sports is the "swinging pendulum of momentum" but players believe it, especially in competitions like this.
So, according to them, where is the momentum now?
"They only have six points, and now they're only four, so maybe we've got some momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he left.
In Europe the advantage is, of course, only four points and twelve points remain.
The Americans think, says Speith, that they have a little bit of guts and a lot of guts, when it comes to Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and have three-pointers out of four.
Spieth led her side and slammed her from tee to green.
The celebration's screams grew stronger as his round lasted, he inserted an important putt to make board in four matches after being two down after two with Thomas.
At the same time his putt won them the match in 15, the type of shout that says the match is not over for the American side.
"You just have to think about it and think about it," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for every player.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players to score higher points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable story of the Ryder Cup.
Four out of four and nothing can make the odd but amazing pairs from Europe wrong.
"Molliwood" was the only couple not living bogey on Saturday afternoons, but they also escaped bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and back nine on Friday mornings.
That's crazy, and how their energy seems to flow from and into the crowd that proves they're the players that should be defeated on Sunday, and no more famous player can guarantee a win for the Europeans at Le Golf National if not for Fleetwood or Molinari.
If it were possible, it would be in different places.
However, it seems that the Europeans' victory was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when they were paired by Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the front nine have left Spaniard and Swede, and they have not been up yet.
But on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It's fun to watch fourballs and foursomes closely due to interactions between couples, the advice they give and they don't give, and the possible sudden change in strategy.
Europe played better as a group today and they were confident towards the final day but this foursome session showed Team USA's strength and strength that some, particularly Stateside, were skeptical of.
Europe won 10-6 to enter the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will only be able to make it to the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the fourball and foursome matches on Saturday with only 10-6 against the United States.
The strong pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini took the lead with two wins against tough Tiger Woods to bring their tally to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side including Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to regain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side who squeezed in the morning fourballs, and won the series 3-1.
The United States fought more foursomes, and won two matches but they couldn't lower the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points as he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a very good weekend, were the second pair to win only four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they combined the force to defeat disappointed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in 5&4.
Woods, who pitched himself in two matches on Saturday, showed short-lived blows of healing but had already received defeats in 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested for the morning fourballs, and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - who were first and third in the world.
The weather has not been good for Europe even if the weather is clear and windy in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a fierce 2&1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after defeating the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned from a four-point deficit to enter the singles, but as holders Furyk's side only needs the draw to maintain the trophy.
After two days of being second in the position, they seemed unable to cope with a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it is 'unilaterally' to disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that they had deepened their suspicions in the United States over the ongoing sanctions and never unilaterally that the country would surrender its nuclear weapons under this situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of representatives from around the world that North Korea had taken "important steps with good intentions" in the past year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the demolition of a nuclear test site, and the promise not to make nuclear weapons and techno.
"However, we have not seen a comparable response from the United States," he said.
"While there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under this situation we will not really unilaterally disarm."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar grievances about Washington's rejection of a "joint" denuclearization approach to which North Korea will honor as it takes small steps, his statement seemed important because it did not immediately reject the unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to reduce the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is pushing for denuclearization" and raising the burden of sanctions to achieve their goals in a violent manner, and they also oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that we will be overwhelmed by sanctions is a deep dream of people who don't know about us.
The problem, however, is that we continue to have doubts about the situation."
Ri has not mentioned any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was announced by the United States chief at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister announced the three had been a meeting between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea and not the United States are the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament, I will not lead to a deathlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed greatly from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korean missiles on U.S. territory after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that he would "northly destroy" North Korea, hailed Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should continue until North Korea denuclearize.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for it, and also said, "If it lasts two years, three years or five months - no case."
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should honor Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of Security Council sanctions should continue to be strictly and without minus until we fully know about widespread, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has jointly tightened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri at the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been good.
He left Pyongyang in July, and said there had been an outbreak, just to be kicked out by North Korea for making "high-demand gangsters."
North Korea has pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to destroy a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States has taken "equivalent measures".
He said Kim mentioned to him the "equivalent measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and the road to normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard, take a course on having enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is helping its undergraduates to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat the macho culture of night-time learning while caffeine is activated.
One academic learned that students in the number one university in the world are often unaware of the most basic ways to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, teacher of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the earliest of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a discussion about the impact of sleep deprivation on the study.
'After that, a woman approached me and said, 'Why did you just tell me this, in my senior year?'
According to him, no one told him about the amount of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course was released for the first time this year explaining to students the importance of having good sleep behavior and how it contributes to academic and athletic activity, as well as overall health.
Paul Barreira, a teacher of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to enter the course after learning that students were completely sleep deprived during a week.
A one-hour course is accompanied by a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athleticism, and the importance of a rou.
In another section, participants are told how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
There is a map of the campus, with interactive icons, which encourage participants to think about their other day-to-day activities.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking," adds Prof Czeisler.
The culture of having an ‘all-nighter' still exists," he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students raise the problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, with good quality, should serve as a ‘secret weapon' of students to combat stress, extreme fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to prevent weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger, so they go hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking a class with him in its first year at Harvard.
He said that his eyes were open and he had the inspiration to pursue a educational course.
He expects that the next step will be to ask stewards to complete a study program similar to it before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should think about setting an alarm when to sleep and wake up, and find out the adverse effects of the ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which could disrupt the circadian rhythm, and cause problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal breaks Gerrard's team
The Rangers again experienced disappointment after Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The side from Ibrox wanted to record their first victory at the opponent's stadium since they won 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard a second defeat within 18 games as manager, to hang his side's eight points against the Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and didn't appear to be battling the Rangers' line-up matched with inspiration.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston is in third place and only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
And there may be more problems waiting for the Rangers after needing to give a solution for the head injury to lineman Calum Spence after seemingly rocking something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight margin changes to pass Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt used the same Livi 11 that scored against the Hearts last week and he would have been happy with how his good team stopped their opponents on each back.
The Rangers were superior to holding the ball but Livingston did a lot more when the ball was in their possession.
They should have reached the end of two minutes when Allan McGregor scored Menga's pass to Scott Pittman near goal but the midfielder squeezed away.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs won Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow couldn't help but force the ball into the back post.
The Rangers have gained control but seem to be more confident than they would be able to make their plan in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty kick within a quarter of the game when they clashed with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers scored two points in the first half of the game but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly failed to beat Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's dark strike.
Although Livi scored in the 34th minute of its innings even though the opponent looked better, they were not denied there due to their graffiti alone.
The Rangers again failed to take action against the deep set-piece of deep Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not take action when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball in the slot to Scott Robinson, who calmly handed Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard acted on the break when he traded Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the swap almost had a quick effect when the winger was able to slot Morelos, but quickly ran off his line the amazing Kelly for that look.
But Livingston continues to make it difficult for visitors to play the exact type of game they like, in which order they sweep their long ball Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's side could have only raised them in the final stages but McGregor was well able to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could get to the wide from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton has yet another substitution for a penalty because they have met Jacobs, but Thomson has not looked back.
Almanac: The Creator of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the day that Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany will one day be a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would later deliver a device called a Geiger Counter.
An important part of science since then, Geiger Counter has also been a major supporter of pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring seemingly obscure cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that thing?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to identify radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you actually hear the effects of atoms caused by radioactivity on minerals."
He said, "It's definitely going to sound right now."
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention still remains attached to his name.
The new vaccine has taught the immune system to "determine" the harmful cells
The new cancer vaccine has taught the immune system to "determine" the harmful cells and destroy them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify the harmful cells.
The procedure includes the removal of immune cells in the patient, and their improvement in the laboratory
They will then be able to 'determine' the protein that is common in most cancers and then inject them back.
Vaccines that are being tested give good results to patients with different types of cancer.
For more than 18 months, the ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine taught the immune system to identify the harmful cells.
The procedure includes removing immune cells from a patient, and improving them in the laboratory so that they "determine" the protein that is common in most cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "It indicates to our results that we have a reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the spread of many types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
Treating the type of leukaemia involves the same procedure of getting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to destroy cancer cells.
Kanye West is singled out on Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a MAGA Hat, after his release on SNL.
The result wasn't good
The "boo" beat Kanye West in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a lengthy performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the position in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to a white man many times and they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
"If I'm thinking about racism, I've had to leave America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began the show with a kit featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star entertained Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Legal Decisions on complaints of sexual exploitation offered by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded footage of West's baptism to social media.
It is not clear if Rock tries to embarrass West in the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was not stopped at the backstage about his hat.
"They beat me in the back.
They say, 'Don't go out wearing 'that hat'.
They've bullied me!
And they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the sunken place?" saying so, he did the "I put on my own superman suit, because that means, you can't dictate to me what I should do. Do you want the world to prosper?
Try to have a love."
Due to his comments, the audience booed at least twice and embarrassed cast members of SNL, according to Variety's report, and there was someone there who declared in the publication that: "The entire studio was packed in silence."
West was inducted as a haunted purchase for singer Ariana Grande, who lost her fiancé, rapper Mac Miller, just days ago.
Many were upset at West's performance of the song I Love It, where he dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the strongest wills: Blessings to the most famous of all."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "just a fact and that's undoubtedly amazing."
"But I choose NOT to recognize a person (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I think is striving and expressing the ideology that surrounds my community.
He had freedom.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had already bought a name, and said he is now "the formally recognized as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to buy his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-rapper Snoop Dogg was originally named Snoop Lion and of course, the music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and later became an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been critically acclaimed
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But firmly led by the actor, 31, the stereotype of the brushless defender, according to him such roles on the screen lead to the frequent thinking of young men that they need to be tough to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed he had "made a mistake" and questioned how to address the problem of harmful masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also, admitted that she wanted to 'be careful' about the issue.
"My personal preference for today - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, based on the problem we see today?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in harmful masculinity due to its overly aggressive characters.
He continued, "What is natural and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men think they need to be this kind of man?
I think, ‘that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how can we change that?
It's clear that something is going wrong for young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he would no longer do any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series was finished next summer, because he said, "he's finished on the battlefields and riding."
Starting in November, Kit will play a wizard in Sam Shepard's True West remake of the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently announced that their meeting with his wife Rose was what he considered the best thing to have happened in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the show 'this, this has been the way to having a family in the future, and to my life from here,' she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, who liked Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were passed through sex, which marked a change from the past.
The spread of HIV in some parts of China is usually caused by transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero in this way, according to Chinese health officials in a Yunnan province discussion.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing every year to 100,000 people.
A chronic issue in China's LGBT community is HIV coffee by sex.
Homosexuality was declared illegal in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT members is still widespread.
Because of the country's conservative appreciation, it is estimated in studies that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men marry women.
Most of the coffee beans in diseases are caused by a lack of sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies her staff disseminating data from GOP senators, and insists on 'compromising lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages for lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrats insisted that "ultra-right wings" plan to humiliate and website the complaints.
"Lies, lies, and many more lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, the released information included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom were from Utah.
The information came out online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill as a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual immorality against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was held.
The information came out a few minutes ago under investigation by three senators Kavanaugh.
In Hill's report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState associated with Waters' office announced the IP address referring to the source of the posts and it provided information for Waters' staff members.
"This is a false and unfounded accusation," Waters continued.
"My staff member - who compromised identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - has nothing to do with the dissemination of this information.
This is a completely false and unfounded accusation."
Waters's statement, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, was quickly leaked online.
"There's anger at this rejection," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he does not have the necessary behavior of a Member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be a fighter.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and respectful."
Fleischer turned out to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' rejection of Judge Kavanaugh, which critics accused of overly smiling during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to remove Waters from the seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "appropriate authorities and entities to the enforcement of the law regarding these fraudulent complaints.
"We will make sure that we identify people who are responsible," he continued, "and they will be held accountable to the law for all their work that destroys and puts everyone and all members of my staff at risk."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - convicted spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
It is now commonplace to look for values for Brexit in any new film set in Britain and it seems to fit the new version of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and made a comeback in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it possible for the country to become a new opportunity to export the strange use of self in ridicule with a subject about how noticeable our insignificance is?
Despite all this, the big-eyed and likely-looking Johnny English unreleased has a license to re-think things for the second time - more than anything else, suggesting his name is a fictional comic created for places where viewers don't speak English.
Of course, he was a vague secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions of being swabish elegant, had little character of Clouseau, with Mr. Bean's character and was greeted by a portion of the man who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire theme song for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson played in what is now sent to forgotten TV ads on Barclaycard, where he caused confusion on his face.
There are one or two good scenes in this latest episode of JE.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter as he wore a medieval jacket and quickly hit the rotor blades on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent can be seen in physical laughter, but it hasn't been effective and overly natural, especially with confidence now adding laughter as its element to the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible.
There used to be humor that it was intended for children rather than those of the right age, and for me, Johnny English's comic strips were not as creative and clear as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in Bean's persona.
The premise now that has long been experienced in the area is the positioning of Great Britain in a difficult situation.
A cyber-hacker hacked into Britain's highly confidential web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, causing disappointment to the duty-bound agent - a debilitating minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the latest thing to ruin the prime minister who is a proud and arrogant man, who is already experiencing complete anxiety over the lack of human support for him in politics: Emma Thompson unravels the performance of this male-Teresa-May character but doesn't get much relief from the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that since all active espionage had been compromised, he had to be brought back from retirement.
And that's what's referred to as college-based Johnny English himself, who is now working as head teacher at an exclusive institution, but provides private lessons on how to become an undercover operative: it's funny, because English gives mala-School of Rock academies well-being.
English immediately called Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit depressed.
Batman and Robin are back in action with their Secret Service rivals, and they can meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls into the lure of charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve Britain's computer troubles: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough had already begun their long adventures of foolish pretending: pretending waiters, they started a fire at an expensive French restaurant; they made a scene to ride unnoticed on Volta's luxurious yacht; and she began a family of volatility for Rearling's head when she tried to work.
There's no doubt that all of the events in that final sequence are fine, but even if it's comforting and cluttered, there's a whole lot of TV coverage on it.
Not a big thing.
And I can't stop thinking about other Johnny English films: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that could give justice to his talent?
The Labour Party has refused to plan for the British to have four working days a week but will be paid the equivalent of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan to have the British working four days a week - but they will be paid the equivalent of five days.
According to the party, the company's bosses want to pass on those who are saved by the major artificial intelligence (AI) change to workers by giving them an extra day of rest.
This will give employees the opportunity to have a three-day weekend - but they will still be able to bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and the plans of the country to favor workers is 'increased'.
The Trades Union Congress endorsed switching four days to a week's work as a way to give workers opportunities in the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times that: "Announcement of the policy review was expected before the end of the year.
"This can't be done overnight but four days a week of work is a goal of the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers and also for the general strategy in the party industry."
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party had pledged to work four days a week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At present, however, the Labour Party has not endorsed this ambition as a whole.
According to a Labour Party spokesperson, "the party does not have a four-day working week policy and the party does not consider it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour's discussion last week to better explain his dream for a revolutionary economic socialism.
According to Mr. McDonnell, he was keen to remove power from 'non-appearing directors' and 'people exploiting the pipeline' in utilities.
It also means in the shadow chancellor's plans that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire stake because the Labour government could impose 'reductions' for inaccurate misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the company's boards and build the Inclusive Ownership Funds that will give 10 percent of private sector companies' equity to employees, which will have annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if they could change their mind on the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh
Due to the FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett, the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court was delayed for at least a week, and there was a question as to whether the department's findings would cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired Sunday, "60 Minutes", the correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if anything from the FBI's possible findings could change their minds.
Kennedy became more open-minded than his partner from South Carolina.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened ‘this, after the accusation came out, I said, ‘Did you ‘do this?'
He's full of courage, he's determined, and he's unwavering."
However, Graham's vote did not seem to change.
"I've got my mind set on Brett Kavanaugh and a big indictment will be needed for that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Mariin rejected it by Brett," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And it is not confirmed by all the people whom he named.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a huge astonishing line-up of performers and a similar astonishing mission; the end of the world's hardships.
In its seven years now, the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by thousands of people who will gather in Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy acts such as the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to gain knowledge for the true purpose of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees must complete a range of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a global leader, making a phone call or making a meaningful phone call.
But how successful is the Global Citizen now that it has only 12 years left before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert to engage with people who encourage action or just add it to what's called "clickivism" - people feel like they can make a real change by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Starting in 2011, Global Citizen said it was able to list more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, encouraging hosts of various purposes.
In this language, these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to advertise the equivalent of more than $37 billion in insurance and provisioning that can make a difference in the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 provisioning and promotions stemming from its action, and at least $10 billion of these had already been spent or used for fundraising.
The group estimates that insured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main contributors include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. partnership of investors and enforcers focused on "helping young adults discover their full potential," which promised to give Rwanda a global donation of $35 million from Citzen 4, to help put an end to malnutrition.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can only footnote the history of social injustice with a lack of nutrition," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman said in a 2018 London address to people at the live concert.
According to the group, after more than 5,000 calls in the U.K. to focus on nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and youth through nutrition measures.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "how do you think we can get rid of extreme hardship?"
The Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes, we will fall and fail.
But like those of our predecessors who have made great strides in the right of repression and action against the policy of separating whites from blacks, we will succeed, because we are stronger when we are together.

U.S. could use the Navy for "passage" to block Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington will be able to "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from being brought to market, including in the Middle East," said U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, from the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's relationship with Syria - particularly where it operates due to the legitimate government's invitation - was only a mere conglomerate to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be an energy broker like they do in the eastern part of Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the capability, using our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, barriers, to ensure that their energy is not going to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself a "energy consumer star" in the US.
He compared Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, roughly, to benefit and exchange energy," he said, while saying that "Russia knows only one thing" that is economically dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements emerged as the Trump administration was promoting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, which is trading in Russia, a far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to divest itself of the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, is why Moscow has "controlled" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an economic project only.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project was only driven by economic reasons and an example of non-fast competition.
"I believe that we both have the view that energy cannot be used as a tool for coercion and that suppliers should be able to select consumers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view from Germany was strongly reactionary, confirming its stance on the project.
The US has called on Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The problem is big when other states interfere in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's "Thinking Good" to run for President in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was "thinking good" about running for president following the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and include a woman as president," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I really think the running of the presidency is good."
Warren remarked to President Donald Trump at a similar meeting, saying that "this country has been taken in the wrong direction.
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our economy," he said.
Warren's criticism of Trump and the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was previously frank.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's subordinates were not convinced he should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent are in favour of this move.
The serbey showed more support for the run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the possible run and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed possible runoff in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"As my son goes through his return, I understand the other families who are experiencing the results of PTSD and some of the feelings our soldiers have brought upon their return," he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a big problem not to discuss" and said that his son and other veterans of the war "return somewhat different, they return trained in violence, asking if there is any respect for anything given to the country by their fellow soldiers and pilots."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and instigated by domestic violence, particularly female violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supported questioning the new asylum policy
The eighteen states and the District of Columbia supported the legal questioning of a new U.S. policy that denied asylum to victims fleeing gang or family violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the friend-of-the-court district offered a brief Friday in Washington to support a person seeking asylum questioning the policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
He said he was abused by his partner "and his children who were members of the violent gang," but U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the source of a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allows undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy had "ignored many decades of state, federal, and world laws."
"Federal law stipulates that all asylum seekers will be judged on the basis of particular facts and events of persecution, and such a ban violates such a principle," said the friend-of-the-court brief.
Lawyers in the brief even argued that the policy that restricts immigration is conducive to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "finance the need for workers."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang bans.
"Asylum is for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or a political opinion," Sessions said in his policy statement on June 11.
Asylum has never been provided to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- faced by people all over the world on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubled in rescue survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's often nerve-wracking," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her wet baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute there's an ambulance carrying bodies.
There is a lack of clean water."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, spilling their wet supplies, trying to borrow anything they could see.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have already flown, which were damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had suffered a back and shoulder injury, are resting outside Army Hospital of Palu, where patients are being treated outside due to continued severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how a very powerful earthquake felt in the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where they stayed with his wife and daughter.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I was forced to fall on the wall and that's it," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, after she's gone, it's quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'advertising propaganda'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper praising the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the leaked statement to the Des Moines Register - the most prominent newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of meddling in the election for the U.S. Congress on November 6, a charge that China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election have become a pretext for what U.S. officials said to Reuters that a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to tighten China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war where they exchange tariffs on each other's imports.
China's replacement tariffs in the first phase of the trade war were designed to target exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the U.S. said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China, "is now intensifying the crackdown by issuing advertising propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the valued American tradition of free speech and free expression by issuing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"While at the newsstands here in Beijing, you can only see a limited amount of conflicting voices and you can't see a real picture of Chinese differing opinions about China's worrying economic direction, because the Chinese Communist Party holds tightly in the media," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most popular newspapers in China is avoiding the offer to publish" this article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Push Women Voters Away Before Midterms in Kavanaugh's turmoil, Investigators Warning
While many mainstream Republicans backed and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warned they would face a severe reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions are very intense about it, and it is seen by most of the Republican nominees that they want to continue voting.
Those things will not go away," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s extended support for the FBI's investigation would be sufficient to alleviate the angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - they can't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the modern MoveOn group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "November is approaching!" as they rallyed in the Senate corridor because Republicans elected to the Control Committee to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be unusual," Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it can rise even further, especially in swing voters women in out-of-town spots and in young voters, about 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote, even though they don't like the president."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts say there could be a strong reaction if Republicans continued the confirmation.
"This has been a big mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the ballot or if Kavanaugh is elected, it's also about the way Republicans handle this issue and how they triviate him," explained Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group helping to elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to have come out halfway on who to believe in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, when a little bit more sidelined later.
The new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee after vowing last week that the poisoned Kavanaugh raped him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his king while they were at a party while they were still studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor's Plan to Launch a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch the startup that aims to oppose Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company created from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people will be allowed to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee said emphatically that the goal behind Inrupt was to "take over the whole world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
Contact lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
For it Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data store is completely controlled by the user who will have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "self-determining power through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring the company methods, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all people.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to release a complete change where all of their business models will be completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt was launched, Berners-Lee will remain Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very positive for this next season of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: clergyman wins Victoria Cross in WW1 celebrated
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross in World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his people 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never learned that he had won Britain's highest military honor.
A protective stone was removed by his two great-grandmothers at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "bright symbol" that exposed the rock exactly 100 years after his grandfather's revered work.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion on the crossing of the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very massive rush as bullets were fired from fields and machine guns."
Later, he went to the first line and led the line forward with "greatest skill" before starting with a field-gun and single-handedly dropped the three in the team.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "one thing I know I can't afford but something humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also dedicated the post-parade flower basket, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it's an honor to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will give."
MMA fans didn't sleep at night to watch Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig did watch
Think about it, wake up at night to watch the opposite Bellator 206 but you won't be allowed to watch it.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 matches, including six on the main card and is broadcast live throughout the UK on Channel 5.
Around 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their confrontation, UK viewers were surprised when the coverage changed and became Peppa Pig.
Some of them were disappointed after they left for the fight until the end of the day.
A Twitter fan said the move was "like a bad joke."
"The government's policy is that at 6 a.m. it is not appropriate to watch such a show so they had to be transferred to the print show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator's company president Scott Coker said they would set their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about replay, maybe we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday morning and we can't fix it until Sunday, and they're Monday.
But we are fixing it.
Believe me, when they moved there, there was a lot of repetitive texts and all of them were angry.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it has something to do with the government.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're just going to do five games instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give the fans away but we were overweight.
It's just a real problem."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'depressed' by sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley has said that he's grown up feeling less than others because of his sexuality - but that's what hampered his success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't think until he reached high school that "not everyone is like him."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs to be printed by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that his desire to win the Olympics was diminished by his parenthood.
The regular host on the long-running show, Kirsty Young, was on vacation for several months due to illness.
Released as a castaway on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" he was "than the others" as he grew up because "it's not easy for society to accept the liking of both men and women."
He said: "Until now, those feelings that I am less, and that I feel different, are the real things that gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that "he was different," he said, so he didn't throw everything away when they learned about his sexuality later.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics became a high-profile campaigner for LGBT and used his release at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries of origin for homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live without consequences and he wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that the lover of a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
"When you go through a lot at a young age" - he first joined the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find an older man who experienced both happiness and sadness.
The couple became parents in June, with their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "full outlook" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all that matters is, 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there's something more important than the gold medals at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of his last questions was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted the front seat.
"I can't say to him, 'You're not coming to sit in front, Dad,'" he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing and it was only then that she really didn't breathe and she really died that she accepted that she wasn't intimidating," she said.
The following year Daley fought in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the people at the Olympic Games, nothing feels better," he said.
It also inspired her first chosen song - Proud of Heather Small - that inspired her to the upcoming Olympics and still built her fur.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was not on the condition that he was seated at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to adjust his condition to prevent it from becoming a sad event.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial event for the record for the 12th time, was knocked out by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as often happens to him for the United States, the five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and testing in the range, hoping to correct anything wrong with him.
Since he never became the most direct driver even during the rest of his career, the 48-year-old is not fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the wrong shots on the long rough are often a problem.
And as if the difficult course wasn't enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faced British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who fell four points starting in 12 singles matches, would start hot, Mickelson's match could be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, because he had nothing else to say.
"He fully understood his role today, grabbed me in the back and guided me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He and Hall of Famer have added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I dreamed more, but that’s what happened and that’s where we thought we were going.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson surpassed Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could mark the end of the Ryder Cup career that has never matched his highest individual record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 threes, and seven tables, although Furyk said his presence brought some unseen benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, he likes to play with people, and he's good with the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed it, this week, and it's fun to look at.
It's more than just playing."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big one is about to disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows, based on the experience that it's easy to lose the big-time singles in the final day of the Ryder Cup and this could be an uncomfortable fight.
The Danish started in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros as captain held only five points for the Americans but narrowly did not reach the finish line because the margin was too small, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You're always reminding yourself that we're only big in Valderrama; we're only big in Brookline, and we lost there, and in Valderrama, we won, but we're small," Bjorn said in the photo, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday for the 10th National.
So history shows me and everyone in that team that it's not over yet.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you can put the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's the attempt to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will stay.
I've said before, I'll focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the other side - the best player in the world."
"I'm happy with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to lead myself here.
There's another monster tomorrow.
Open individual performances can be seen, and other activities are that.
It's good to get out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone there, you can test the limits of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to understand to the players, releasing everything you can tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he needs to go and get out as much as he can."
Compared to Bjorn, controversial figure Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better as an individual than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of the big changes on the final day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before losing when Europe saw "Miracle and Medina."
"I remember every word here," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players until the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When it goes in one direction the bubble ‘that', it brings a lot of pressure into the middle matches.
We're doing our line-up as needed and we're releasing the players because, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the reward game and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
"This is what I've done with this group of players because I think it's the best until the end," Bjorn said in his singles selections.
Germany's new warship has been postponed
Germany's latest frigate in 2014 should have been assigned to purchase old warships dating back to the Cold War period, but it will not happen until next year due to system failures and rising costs, local media reports.
The assignment to "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing what a military spokesman said.
The ship should have been with the Navy in 2014, but the major project was in trouble due to serious issues after it was delivered.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced with the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they have a strong cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that the latest warships - which are said to enable Germany to show power overseas - will become old when it comes time for them to enter service, Die Zeit said.
The fateful F125 frigate last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, was the head of the news.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited some "defects of important software and hardware" that caused the warship to be useless if it was deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are all the more important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 destroyers - only half of the workers of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship turned out to be too heavy which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the ship's equivalent class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1bn ($3.6bn) - up from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2bn.
Problems surrounding the latest frigates are becoming increasingly important due to recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
In the first part of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of Germany's parliament, admitted that the Navy had actually "depleted ships that could still be deployed."
The official said the issue had grown over time, as the old ships had been removed but no given purchase ships.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were with the Navy.
The National Trust is committed to the safety of bats
The purpose of new research conducted outside of a estate in the Scottish Highlands is to reveal how butterflies use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected to shed light on the behavior of strange flying mammals and will help guide future care activities.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland's study followed common and soprano pistrels as well as brownish long-eared panics and Daubenton's panics at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations around the property to monitor the butterfly's activities throughout the time.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts analyze the sound in all recordings will verify the frequency of bats and which species makes which sound.
Then, create a residential map to have a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to learn the benefits of residential management activities such as field creation and what is the best way to deforestation of forests for bats and other related species.
The butterfly population in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered from the construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind-driven turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flypapers and some chemicals treated by building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Butterflies aren't really blind.
However, because of their ability to hunt at night, their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching squirrels.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to determine the insects and insects on the path they are hiding.
The butterflies are important to the NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country.
It has trained experts, who regularly perform squirrels, inspect nests and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only suspected reserve land for bats in Scotland on the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson claims that the estate is the best territory for them.
"We've got a nice place for the butterflies here," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of veteran trees and all of the beautiful residences.
But a lot of people don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and with other properties can help us understand more about what they need to survive."
He underlined the importance of inspections if there are bats before digging inside the property because it is possible that accidental destruction of just one mother's nest could kill 400 women and young bats, potentially destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and illegal to kill, harass or stab them or destroy their nests.
Scottish Bat Conservation Trust official Elisabeth Ferrell is encouraging the public to help out.
He said: "We have much more to learn about our bats and we don't know the condition of the population of many of our species."
Ronaldo did not consider the rape charges as lawyers were preparing to file a case against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of rape against him "fearful news," saying there were people who "wanted to squeeze themselves" with his name.
His lawyers are due to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, said the reports were "frightening news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
They said good news today," said the camera of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.
"They want to use my name for themselves.
That's normal.
They want to be famous so mention my name, but that’s just work.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would be charged for "moral damages at the cost of the intrusion, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of its personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were alleged to have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped the woman, according to papers presented to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was "a kind man" who was beaten by "one percent."
Documents that Ronaldo has confirmed that the two have sex, but they both like it.
Mayorga also says he went to the police and the photo caught his wounds in a hospital, but later agreed to a plea because he was "afraid of revenge" and worried about "shameful to the public."
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking to recapture the ring because he continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: 'Lifetime regret' UK's loss of vehicle makers
The UK's "lifelong regret" if it loses its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effect of border delays in the event of no Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year and 90% of these were exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have released their fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what vehicle makers say are the risks of the supply chain in the event of no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis where parts come every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parties.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's inventory value at its plant in Derbyshire, the company said, so production will be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the US was "well-organized to avoid such border investigations."
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success at the moment but to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"Based on the evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, we need to fully pursue any highly successful supply chain team."
Toyota can't say how long production will last, but warns that in the long run, the additional costs to the plant's ability to compete will be reduced and will eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union convenor at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, as soon as these jobs are gone, they will not be able to return.
A government spokesperson said: "We have come up with a correct and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed once again" as the problem with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, ties with Trump's and Russia's aides and possible presidential obstruction of justice.
There has been debate for months over whether Trump will be blaming the deputy attorney general, and if so Mueller's independence would be jeopardized.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing the wire to record Trump's talks and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" prosecute Rosenstein but postponed the meeting to avoid controversy with the Senate judiciary committee hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set for it, maybe this week, it could be postponed another week because of all the other things happening in the Supreme Court.
But let's take a look at it and I'm always up to date with the press."
Several reporters will object to that statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing at While House since September 10.
The host asked Chris Wallace why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to the dislike of the TV reporters' "feeling," though he said: "I'm not contraring that they're really messy."
He then indicated that there was a lot of direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The Q&A is doing more of the president's sessions than the ones before him," he said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "We're looking at these numbers."
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but "if there's a chance the press will ask the president of the United States himself, that's better 'than talk to me.
We've been trying to do that often and you've seen us do it often over the past few weeks and it'll replace the press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president perhaps showed why, in displaying the lack of formality and sometimes odd looks in front of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to the EU staff working for the NHS of Scotland to express their gratitude and want them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter now less than six months left until the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has pledged to implement the value of applications for settled status for EU citizens who are working on its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "Last summer, talks between the UK and the EU on leaving, hopefully there will be decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible lack of agreement.
I know that this is a worrying time for all of you.
So I want to reiterate now how important each person's weight is to me, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and the community that we serve.
There is no doubt that Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Sentenced to Emergency Surgery After Head Damage
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie succumbed to emergency surgery after gaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred a few moments before the halftime.
"He went to the sideline and just fell there," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by trainers and medical personnel on the sidelines before she was placed in the stretcher and taken for further evaluation.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details have been given on the type/benefit of the injury" and that the Tennessee State is trying to find out where the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign purchases of property in the UK will be charged a higher stamp duty
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK and will use additional money to help homeless people under Tory's new plans.
The move is opposed to Corbyn's desire to attract young voters
Stamp duty increases for non-tax payers in the UK
It is expected to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are set to charge a higher stamp duty when they are purchased by property in the UK - and will use the extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May announces it today.
The move will be seen as countering the success of Jeremy Corbyn's desire to entice young voters with promises to provide affordable housing and to attract large-scale earners.
An increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used to support the Government's desire to solve street sleep.
The surcharge - which adds to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels implemented two years ago in secondary housing and in houses purchased for rent - may be up by three percent.
The Yemeni government expects this measure to reach up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly created properties in London are purchased by UK non-residents, which raises prices so it becomes harder for buyers to buy a home for the first time.
Many wealthy places in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because many foreigners buy what is not in the country most of the time.
The new policy came out just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in stamp duty to help young people of the right age buy their first home.
He criticized large construction companies for the continued high price of property by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to sideline quotas on affordable homes to settle for "smooth housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced the enticing series of proposed housing reform, including controlling rents and ending expulsions with "no reason".
He also wanted to give the councils greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would provide my premiership in restoring the Britons' dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that there is a problem in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have a life here.
However, it is not so easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based in other countries, to buy homes such as a miserable British resident.
Too many people have dreamed of having a home, and it's still a real problem to sleep on the street."
Jack Ross: 'My ambition above all is the government of Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ambition above all" is to be the ruler of Scotland when the sun comes.
Scot, 42, appreciates the challenge of reinvigorating the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I have played for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's that," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and it always seemed like someone was calling me back.
That's the only way I'll be able to manage the club."
Ross' predecessors as governor of Sunderland included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he is not afraid to follow the names already known in such a large club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this moment is based on 'can I get this club back in the Premier League?'
Due to the arrangement and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that it is part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to bring it there, but maybe I'll just consider myself a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross was just three years old in his management career, after being assistant boss at Dumbarton and becoming part of the Hearts coaching staff at the age of 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover from a downturn in the third tier, and changed St Mirren from a minor downturn to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross said he feels more comfortable now than he did when he was playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably a crossroads," he recalled about the administration of Alloa.
"I really think I'm more of a manager than a player.
It's kind of weird because I've been playing well, I've been able to live here, and I've had a good time.
But it is difficult to play.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I’m still going through that when it comes to work stress and pressure but the management is just right.
"I've always wanted to be the ruler and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable feeling I've felt for myself in my entire life as if I were at the right age."

According to sarbey, Saturday 5:30pm is the best time for a pint
The hot summer has raised the sales of hard-pressed pubs in Britain but has put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pub and bar sales rose by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant sales fell by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consultancy said: "The continued rise of the sun and the longer England's expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed what happened in June, when pub sales rose by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were much stronger.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June increased in July.
The sales of pubs and bars that drank the main goods were stronger, and in comparison to the two seasons, they raised more than the restaurants lowered.
The effect of summer on food pubs is also not as good as the main commodity, although not as bad as the demand of the restaurant operators.
People seem to want to go out and drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM's leisure and hospitality analysts said: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social events or athletics remain the biggest factors affecting the market advantage of those outside their homes.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be even more painful when it adds to the ongoing pressure of spending.

One in five children has a secure social media account that they don't tell their parents
One in five children - some are just 11 years old - have a secure social media account that they don't tell their parents and teachers, according to sarbey
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> 20,000 high school students have been exposed to the rise of "fake Insta" pages
The news intensifies fears of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that is shown to parents.
One in five children - some are just 11 years old - create social media accounts that they secure from the elderly.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened the fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" account displayed to parents, while they also had private accounts.
A mother who accidentally spotted her 13-year-old son's secret site met a teenager who urged other people to "experience me."
Research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of about 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted they had private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are fascinated with creating online spaces where they can't be found by parents and teachers."
Doyle will be "voices for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the government branch.
Doyle is the track and field athlete in Scotland with the most wins and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for gamers to benefit from his extensive experience at the global level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect for the sports communities in Scotland, UK and around the world and we are sure that Scotland's athletics will benefit greatly from bringing him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm interested in standing up as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta along with his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC expert, cannot walk after having a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said only time could tell if I was better or at what level.
It's hard work but I'm completely healed, I'm learning how to walk again and now I'm exercising to be fit!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Here's a look at the online advertising for breast pumps where mothers are compared to cows.
The breast pump company split the opinion on the internet due to the advertisement in which the breastfeeding mothers are compared to the injured cows.
To mark the launch of what they say is "the first silently worn breast bump in the world," the company Elvie released a humorous sarcastic music-like video advertisement to show the freedom the new pump gives to pregnant mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a grass-filled vault on the play with accompanying lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm hurting myself but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed I'm not fat 'that's them, my heart is that."
The choir goes on to say, "Feel, feed, feed, feed the babies, feed, feed, feed my boobs."
However, the advertisement, which has already been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
There have been 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it inferiorizes the "horrible" in the dairy industry.
"The decision to use cows to advertise the product is really not good.
Just as we need them to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, so their breasts are only a few days away from birth," said one.

Another comment: "Firstly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers who are not far from their babies?"
He added: "There is no such thing as an advertisement."
One of the women said the song was "smiling" for her.
"This is an idea for me.
I would have bought it if I was still breastfeeding.
I really feel like I'm pumping.
There's also a bit of a change in advertising, but I think it's true.
"This is a product," one said.
Another comment: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (often in their jobs or buckets) and feel like "cows."
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women will reveal that they are all dancing with undisclosed pumps inside their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump milk say they feel like they are cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and fits inside the nursing bra indistinctly, so the women are more mobile, they can handle their babies more easily, and are still able to get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie Pump has brought a big change so it should just give it a bold and exciting launch.
Compared to pumping women and cows, we'd like to notice the milk pumping and all the hard stuff about it, while showing in a comforting and understandable way the great comfort brought by the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvis has been the headliner.
During London Fashion Week, a mother with a two-year-old son pleaded for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp in Texas Border
The number of detained young migrants has risen despite the fact that the monthly crossing of the border remains unchanged, partly because it has become more difficult to put the children to sponsors as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration.
Typically, most of the sponsors have also become undocumented immigrants, and are afraid to put up with impediments to their own ability to stay in the country when they receive a child.
The risk rose this June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other senior members of their household had to submit a fingerprint, and shared the data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individual sponsors or members of the sponsors' household are here in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are foreign criminals.
So we continue to strive for such individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order for children to be processed more quickly, officials implemented new policies that would appoint them to appear in court within a month of cadetization, rather than after 60 days, which is the former standard, according to shelter workers.
Many face video conference call, rather than personal, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for help are quickly deported.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or sad, which can lead to severe anger or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Supporters said those concerns were more pronounced in a larger facility such as the Tornillo, where signs that a child is in trouble are likely to be unnoticed, due to its size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare their emotions or to say goodbye to friends could be reminiscent of the trauma that many have already experienced.
U.S., France and Turkey's 'subject forces' told Syria to leave immediately
While speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has been in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the presence of foreign forces in Syria's territory is illegal, condemning the fight against terrorism, and "to be treated as appropriate."
"They have to leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more had to be removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "deplore the sacred battle until both terrorist groups and "any foreign presence that is illegal" are removed from all Syrian territories.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces to fight President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were fine for them to return, and he criticized "some western countries" for "spreading unjustified fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have already called on the global community and charities to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing the whole utilitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large fort of the rebels in Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
In the Russian-Turkish agreement, a large-scale attack by Syrian forces assisted by Russia in the province, where three million people live, was avoided.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear barriers" and expressed the hope that military action would end jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which is "destroying."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the government and members of the opposition to draft the basic law after the war for Syria and postpone the elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
In that sense, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless, as expected by perhaps many liberal spectators, his presidency will be prematurely terminated by insurgency and scandal.
In an unmistakable "dramatic end of presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
As of 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable ratings in the syndicate of 3.5 million viewers on the nights of major news.
"It sounds like a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who became president after breaking down the Capitol in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has a different theory.
He recalled riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he was going to fire Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,' " Ms. Scovell said to me.
The unrest was mild.
Of course, unlike others on TV, stories from Washington may affect the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families reunite, and the health of the global economy.
To not listen is a luxury that can only be done by the richest viewer.
But beyond being a citizen, Trump has spent six hours watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," on Paul Manafort's $15,000 bomber jackets.
If I were you, I'd have a different view of Super Mario.
"Part of what he's doing so for this reality show is because he's got something to offer you every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's spin-off cast and the day-to-day remake of the show.
You will be left out if you pass an epidemic.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He couldn't leave the show, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was scheduled to appear on the Senate Judiciary Committee and suspended the Supreme Court's future.
"I remember when we were doing funny shows back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money from outside floods the toughest Congressional fight in the midterm election
It's no surprise that cash floods in Pennsylvania's 17th, thanks to the changes in congressional districts that led to the opposition of the two currently sitting for the same seat.
It recently contested the Pittsburgh district's re-elected Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won a seat in other districts in a special election in the spring.
Lamb is running against another currently sitting Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the representative of Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is actually being rigged by the new 17th.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling in January that the old districts were manipulating in violation of the basic law to favor Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th began a fight for campaign funding between the main party's leadership branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning very little in a special election in March that was watched by many for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republican held that position for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a little.
U.S. Weighs Punishment in El Salvador for Support to China, Then Resigns
Diplomats that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump had a good meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners instigated the Trump Organization's governing team.
State Department officials have decided to return American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, were taken into account, including for drug controls, development support and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which include financial aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the country in Central America and for the high level of unemployment and death there.
As internal meetings progressed, officials in North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow up on a similar one-year meeting of the United States that was seen as a step forward towards a halt.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending any consideration of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, to be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's appreciation for the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks on the condition that they were not named.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside reviewer close to the administration and also spoke on the condition that he was not named.
The study of the history
The next thing to happen is the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible judicial impediments, which now has plenty of evidence in the public record.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller has now turned his investigation into whether Trump's campaign with Russia has compromised its attack on our election.
If the holding of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this branch, as he prepares to re-elect, and perhaps later face a jury consisting of his fidelities.
That's a lot of it, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall - or his allegiance to Europe - is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have a lot of decisions to make that will affect how long the deal lasts.
In 1938, the Germans were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the next three years of watching.
The course of history revolves around such points of change of direction, and the unstoppable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing some of the points of this change today.
What do we do if Mr. Trump accuses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been held back since this newspaper reported that, last year, he secretly proposed to record the president and even gave speculation that the president was not fit for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times' account is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the new F.B.I. inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?"
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterms for a Congress that will answer Mr. Trump?
If we fall into those trials, the winter of democracy will last.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied my home as an ambassador.
He survived, went to America and, 60 years later, I had the Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika mark.
With that in mind, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic in upcoming match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following a stunning table in Spain against Villarreal in the first half of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury stopped midfielder Graham Dorrans coming out of the season to a 2-2 board at Villarreal but he believes the Rangers could use that result as a stimulus to bigger things.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game and thought we could get out with points.
We could have gotten it in the end, but overall, the score is probably a good one.
Maybe they were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
On Thursday, it was a big night in Europe.
"I wish we could get three points but the game would be difficult because they had a good result in their last game, but we were supported by the people, so I'm sure we will fight and get a positive result.
Last year was really tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club itself but with a good feeling in the area today.
The team was great and the members really enjoyed it; the training was great.
We hope to be able to fight now, celebrate last season and be successful."
Women's rights have been violated by fears of retiring
Despite the fact that the participants in the sarbey have a clear idea of how they want to take care of, only a few people talk to their family members about it.
About half of the number of individuals in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the amount of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't take steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here it can start.
Talk to your wife and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't tell your preferences early.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how care will be received, as these decisions are a big deal in the future.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help meet these expenses or insure yourself with your own money - if you have money.
Fix your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
Have a health care proxy so that you can assign a reliable individual to take care of your medical care and make sure that the professionals follow your preferences in case you are unable to speak.
You also need to have the power of attorney for your finances.
You will be chosen by a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and be sure to pay your bills when you can't.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that there is a medical emergency with your elderly parent and go to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Discuss those details in a written plan for you to be ready.
"It's not just money, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to prepare that plan."
Man shot several times by air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home one night.
The victim, aged about 40, was at Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "an actual move."
The victim did not see him shot.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police appealed to the witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Due to the disruption of communication lines, no information was available to officials of aid agencies from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated following the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow outlook on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 as of 2017.
The city celebrates the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency with over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The population is estimated at 299,200 in 2017 by the regency, which is an administrative region less than the province.
Fisheries and farming are the main indicators of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is located in Morowali, on the other coast of Sulawesi.
Tsunami struck Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the deaths of more than 200 people and the destruction of hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, and nine were killed.
Indonesia is in the turbulent part of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific and regularly experiences an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, 226,000 people died off the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of these were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
He died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude strike hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, and nearly 700 people die.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which triggered a tsunami that was 10 meters high that devastated dozens of spots and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people remember the destruction caused by a very powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami followed this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the remote tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and put thousands of tourists in a temporary emergency.
Sarah Palin Arrested on Family Violence Allegations
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of torture.
Palin, 29, was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troops.
According to a police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin took the phone from her.
Palin was deported to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and in custody based on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, sure" when asked about his defense, the network reported.
Palin faced three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and raise $250,000.
He was also convicted of Class B misdemeanour, with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time Palin has been prosecuted in criminal cases.
In December 2017, he was accused of hurting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the pain.
The case is currently in the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was subjected to family abuse, interference in reporting on domestic violence, and a weapon charge while being poisoned in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said that Palin hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was led by veterans' groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent actions to PTSD originating from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of people have died
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude tsunami struck and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication lines have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the center of Sulawesi located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos are broadcasting on social media showing the exact moment of the earthquake.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the rare death penalty for the suspect in the terrorist attack in NYC
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that was killed by eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used Home Depot's rental truck to carry out an attack on a road bike along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which hits people walking and cycling on its trail in October.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors had to prove Saipov's "intentional" killing of eight victims and "intentionally" inflicting serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was offered in the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to be excused by the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed 22 perfect suits against Saipov along with eight counts of suicide support for impeachment, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charged with violence and de-motor vehicle demolition.
Prosecutors said the attack required "great preparation and planning," and described Saipov's method of carrying out it as "harmful-dirty, cruel and ruthless of the same."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicts pain, injury and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pangolso in the aftermath."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York was indicted for the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were hanged after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is the capital of Uzbekistan, has not shown any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he was pleased with what he did, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had the inspiration to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the perfect.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He did not commit any sins in the 22 perfect.
David Patto, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the guilty plea for life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma caused by these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations, according to Tory MP
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today in protest at the Tory convention.
The former Ukip leader said the need for politicians was to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she should be in charge of the EU negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK would have "exited now" if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge of Mrs May's future to reconcile her hate group was underscored by the accession of Tories in favor of staying in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has difficulty keeping the run of his Chequers compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, who want to stay and in the EU.
The allies insisted that he would continue to try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite a negative reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and the 'disturbance'.
Mr Bone told Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wants to 'waste the Chequers'.
He proposed that Mr Farage should be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he had been the ruler, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we need to eliminate the Chequers."
In his remarks, he said: "We don't fight world wars just to be consistent.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone ignored proposals that had changed public opinion since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is not entirely true."
Tory in favour of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: 'What I'm saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Half the public doesn't like the Chequers, the Opposition won't vote for them, our party and our activists don't want them walking down the street and electing us.
Just talk, forget the Chequers and start listening."
In a bizarre message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers will remain in office if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that the politicians in the rally must "feel the pressure" if they plan to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's about now the trust between us - the people - and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to abandon Brexit and we're here now to tell them 'we won't let you do that.'
In a message to enthusiastic groups of people, he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians, who intend to back away from Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who have given us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we are free, governed by ourselves, the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay to Birmingham marched before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
There are a number of activists who are waving the flags of Tory Against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced in a party app at the opening of the conference.
"It's the people who tell us that they can put in IT systems and all the technology for Canada and much more, for no borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's just laughter.
"There's nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan to "think well" running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that "think good about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats discussed his future in a town hall in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, runs for re-election in November against GOP state representative Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chairs Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He is in the midst of speculation that he will fight Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting of the subdivisions using the format of the town hall since the time of Trump's sitting.
One of the guests asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and with it a woman as president."

The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.

"Wayde Sims got the right bullet in the head that he killed," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defends his friend and Simpson shoots him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was in the crime scene, had a handgun, and admitted shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give him the win from Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes" team order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in his defense of his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to sue his teammates.
Vettel first stopped at the pit and left Hamilton to go into traffic at the end of the group, something that should have decided on the result.
Mercedes slammed after a lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came ahead after a touchdown where the Ferrari driver hesitated to leave the free-threatened to continue defending after the double-move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from behind the grid and finished seventh in the final of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the bulk of the race as he went on to run to aim for a quick finish and lead Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth.
He later stopped the pit in the 44th lap but was unable to speed up his run in the remaining eight lap as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did well all weekend and really became a master and gave me.
"The team did a very special job of getting a one-two," Hamilton said.
Really Bad Body Fate ‘Yon
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump impeached Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not disclose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly ignore the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "cruel and evil and lying."
"One thing that can happen and the good things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and evil and lying," he said.
"When you see the shows and revelations after they say 'oh, I'm not the one doing that.
I'm not the one doing that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you the one who gave up?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the document - "Ah, ah, what?"
Ah, no.
I'm not the one who gave up."
Go ahead.
"No, no, no, no, no, no," he added, as he continued.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was revealed in early September - but Feinstein denied that his office had been the one to reveal.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and that's what I did, as he requested."
But his previous rejection of the president, who commented on Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you, it's really bad body work.
Maybe he didn't do it, but 'that's the worst body work I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexually abusing three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who will hurt, who they will suffer to gain power," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned to the Belfast Giants' third in the Elite League on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored only early two goals with strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie crossed the home side before Dwyer returned only the Giants.
Francois Bouchard played the game for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals scored the victory.
It was Adam Keefe's third in the Elite League of the season for the people, coming from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth encounter of the season by two sides, winning the Giants in the last three games.
Dwyer's opener entered the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford assisted as Beauvillier doubled just four minutes later.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home side to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's lead at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure to lead the Giants in the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard defeated them again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee just for the first time in the game in the latter part of the second period and secured the victory in his team's fifth half until the final period.
The Giants, who are now three in four of their last five games, will return home and head to the Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Died as Air Traffic Controller Determined to Survive Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was called a hero after he died as he was assured that a plane carrying hundreds of people could fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which began a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continued to blow up the area and many were trapped in the destroyed buildings in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues' evacuation to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the watchtower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He left to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
He then jumped into the traffic control tower when he thought it would fall.
He eventually died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We took a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are soaked in this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, because according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number is still rising because many more bodies are under the collapsed buildings while others are unreachable," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six metres destroyed the Palu to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial air vehicles are also carrying aid and supplies, as well as supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives carrying bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
Small shops are being looted all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, president of Indonesia's International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help the survivors but we don't know what they will see there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to finish every evacuation work.
"Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit in the first part of this year by earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crashes: According to Air Niugini, a man disappears after plane crashes in lake
The airline now says the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lake in Micronesia with one man missing, after first stating that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday afternoon, a man could not find a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in good condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the lake and did not reach the runway.
Several witnesses believed the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"It's really good stuff," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to walk in the water until they were able to go to emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were frightened and yelling, and that he had received a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy has also said that rescuers who repaired the nearby port were helping by using a fishing boat to get people to the beach before the plane sank at about 30 meters (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered with PNG over the past two decades but have not yet been involved with Air Niugini.
The story of the night when a woman was burned to death.
The prosecution ended its argument on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning alive to a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice investigator Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to meet the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed up with Tellis Chambers the night of his death, contradicting Tellis's earlier statement, the Clarion Ledger report.
When the data showed that the man's cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was in another location that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was then in Nashville."
Another non-compliant was Tellis' statement that he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of his death.
Based on the phone records, they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis opened Chambers' texts, calls and contact information on his phone.
"She's the girl in her life," Hale said.
Its final arguments are set to begin defence on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to go to trial that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
Three hip hops want to challenge the negative outlook on the genre by putting positive messages into their music.
The High Breed, which is from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its sources of political message and response to societal issues.
They want to go back to their roots and push the conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common re-emerged in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
It's black again?!
A police officer in NY sued a couple for dismissing her from work after the "racist" text
A New York police officer has sued the couple for discriminating on her dismissal after receiving a wrong text message from her mother complaining that she was "black again."
The couple denied that they were racist, and compared the lawsuit to "rape."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, with two children, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"HINDIIIIIIIIII ITIM NAMAN," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her text to her husband.
So, instead of sending it to his wife, he sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After learning of her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "disappointed" Ms. Maurice, saying that the work of their former great-grandmother, who was an African-American, was not good, and what she expected was a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day at work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for pay for dismissal from work, and demanding a salary of $350 per day for six-month, stay-in work he would have done, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know this discrimination."
The couple complained that they were racist, saying that removing Maurice from work was reasonable, that they feared they could not trust him after they hurt his feelings.
"My wife sent me a text that she didn't really want to say.
He is not a racist.
We are not racists," his wife Joel Plasco said in the Post.
"But do you trust your children with a person you're cheating on, even if it's unintentional?
What's your newborn baby?
“No, no.”
While comparing the lawsuit to "distortion," Plasco said that only two months after the birth of his wife and "too much trouble in the situation."
"You want to sue someone like that?"
“It’s not that bad,” added the banker.
As the case continued, the public quickly criticized the couple on social media, prioritizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not like talking bear, revealing new letter
Bond's son Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's exciting to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
He still believes his work will be rejected, he said of his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before drawing inspiration from a small toy bear who wrote a comic book, and added that the book's 60th anniversary was "happy and sad" after his death.
He describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that his father is proud of the success in the end.
"He's a quiet man, and he's not a good man," he said.
"But because Paddington is real to him, it's like your son has achieved something: you're proud of them even if you're not the one who did it.
I think that's what he thought of Paddington's success.
Although it was created and imagined by him, he then gave the honor to Paddington himself."
I said goodbye on the phone when my son died.
After landing his son at the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried but failed to save his life.
"He called Nad to say that it was really bad, that there was no hope for him to live," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And that’s what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, son.
I'll be there soon.
We're together.
Gradually the effect was reduced and the medications given to him by the doctors were lost in his body to keep his heart pumping.
He died before that and ‘that’s what it’s all about.
I can't do anything but sit there and wait, knowing that all this is happening.
I can't cry or cry because there are so many people around me.
I had to stop it all."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was saddened by her son's departure, boarded a plane with other passengers - unaware of her passing.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I'm just tired and I can't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I felt a lot of compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding for me.
I know he loves the baby."
Women's rights activists put cards on hold to prevent deterioration of the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to stop others from committing suicide as well.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on the Welsh bridge cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son hopes to be a chef with a pleasant smile.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
She always said that her smile was good."
So, he left the job before he died, because "he was so sad."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother saw his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will have an effect."
Ms. Davis created cards, "to tell people that someone is going to and they can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't be shy - you need to talk to someone."
Ms Humphreys, who had been friends with Ms Davies for several years, was left by Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother left.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Two days before Easter, we noticed a change in his behavior.
Sadly he was sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts he couldn't stay with them."
He told them that his death was a great trauma, but they had to accept it: "It's really a huge loss in the family.
We're splitting up.
We all have to fight and fight."

The next day Brett Kavanaugh was hanged as the FBI began the investigation.
"I thought, if we could do something as he requested - an investigation in a limited time, limited scope - there would be at least a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "break apart" in the midst of party confirmation.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It's all because of the time.
The midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do not succeed, they will be too weak in their attempts to elect the people they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the Senators, speaking with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and by this he met his wife Ashley, then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI makes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to resolve the ballot table and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'declining' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
While citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said it was a big deal to tighter border controls between North Korea and China and to higher levels of human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not given any public comment.
Most of the defectors from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the tightly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and is often forced to return them.
It has had a great deal of disruption in the past months of relations between the North and the South - which in fact are still fighting each other.
In the first part of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on general limits for the deal to the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for the lack of implementation since then.
"If there is no trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and in such a situation, we will never be able to disarm first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "too noisy," not entitled to serve in the Supreme Court
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "too noisy" and said he was not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court for his conduct.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman were to behave like that, they would say 'too loud,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford during their teens.
In his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming several times and crying as his family and his high school years were discussed.
She also denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against her "serious and coordinated lobbying" arranged by liberals over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed he was not in favor of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself from those statements and the way he denounced the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to assassinate Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the Lower House.
"I'm going to say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he doesn't deserve it not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not the time to go to court a noisy and selfish person and we're going to say, 'Isn't it nice 'that's it,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a reasonable rejection, many months and years of anger flow, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I think it's just normal, isn't it?"
She went on to say, "A woman executive helped me a lot, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but she made a way that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You think I might be sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And he went on.
I think that’s good.”
Tears are allowed as a way of expressing anger because first misunderstanding of them.
One of my clearest memories from my earlier jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I cried with irresistible anger, was to stab me in the lap of an older woman - an obstinate manager I was always afraid of - and dragged me down a staircase.
"Never, never let them see you cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to hear you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic congress from Colorado, has been employed by Gary Hart in his run for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught entertaining his wife inside a boat called Monkey Business and retreating into the fight, Ms. Schroeder, who was really disappointed, thought that there was no reason for him not to think he ran himself into the presidency.
"It really didn't make the decision 'that'," he told me when he laughed 30 years later.
"There are seven candidates, and they don't need another.
One man called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign began a long time ago, he has already been left to raise funds, so he vowed not to join the fight unless he could raise $2 million.
There was no victory in that fight.
He discovered that some of his supporters who would give $1,000 to the men would only give him $250.
"Do you think they're going to give me a discount?" he asked.
When he spoke and announced he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude to the people who supported him, disappointment with the system where it was so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at gender discrimination - he was able to cry.
"You think I've had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"You're the one who sponsored me.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my wall?
"He's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could improve in Beijing
The initial explosions in the U.S.-China trade war are striking, and while the fighting is far from over, Beijing may well be able to keep the gap between the countries in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued the first warning in the early part of this year by imposing a tax on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week entered the largest increase in new tariffs affecting the $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, which in fact is taxing half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing retaliated each time, the latest being the introduction of a tariff of five to ten percent on $60 billion of goods from the United States.
China has pledged to stick to the U.S. with every move, and the world's second-largest economy is likely to fail in the near future.
In order for Washington to resign, it will have to surrender to the demands, but the open surrender to the US would be a disgrace to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts still say that if Beijing acted properly, China's support for U.S. pressures on the long-term trade war would be positive by lowering the level of linkage between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would initiate economic integration in either country, is more dangerous than those previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia and the American Security at the Center for New Security.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the country's resurgence that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country had improved.
"The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to work on rehabilitation in areas that have been damaged by terrorists in order to restore everything to normal.
There are already all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that are taking place in their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
And six million people still living in the country are in need of charities.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime was open to aid in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he insisted that it would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the smuggling.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA in the final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has won the Ryder Cup six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson's tee-shot, struggling throughout the tournament, fell into the water at par-3 16th hole, and he accepted the defeat of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari went on to shine in all his rounds, becoming a 1-on-4 player to score 5-0-0 since the start of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest ranking player in the European team, with Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who could be in his last Ryder Cup game.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia was the most successful in the tournament of all time in his 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop now.
This man has become difficult.
So I'm thankful for Thomas and he chose me and he believed in me.
I was happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotional, following success in Europe.
He handed over the role to his compatriot John Ram who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles game on Sunday.
"I'm really proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods won all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A unique statistic of one of the best players of all time, won 14 major titles that only doubled with Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairways except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There was a moment this morning that we had a bit of trouble in Europe.
We were fighting.
Greetings to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
The game was very good for all 12 players.
We will work together again, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 years and I'm determined to serve as a captain.
You are truly welcome.
They're just better."
