Inflation, in Europe, has eroded on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 countries of the euro area was more significant than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community statistics office located in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the principal interest rate by saying that lowering interest rates, with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation in order not to have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market shares increased by 88 percent and soybean prices also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the global oil price rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 in 2008, this year to 2.5 per cent, but will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the inflation rate over 12 months remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the central rate twice in 2008.
Gallup Reports Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December, so that since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute of Polling) has never before seen such a low socialist support, i.e. 13 per cent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the opposition's greater determination, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democrats Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the loyal voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the economic situation of the country to be particularly serious has never been so high, it rises to 41 per cent and according to complementary 46 per cent the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects an aggravation and only one-tenth expects an improvement.
Last December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny while 38 percent support Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, currently this rate is only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the voter turnout, 60 percent of respondents said they would definitely vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to enrolment in higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportion of people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters, respectively, would reject the introduction of enrolment fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, unlike this year's VAT rate did not increase.
Article de Daily Economy (Economie quotidienne)
This year, in the Budaörs trade triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase of significantly more than one thousand forints was seen in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which had “already flown” in major grocery stores last December, have not risen sharply from the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items bought well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Unicum and live fish prices remained almost at last year's level, but turkey, walnut and turkey prices have risen sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics), but at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to only 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the registered two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints per registered bottle included.
Only this year, in terms of Daily Cart, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent, respectively.
By comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we see a 12 percent gap while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive one is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process confused the trade, the hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin to apply on products so they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher than the value of 1,720 forints in 2006, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was higher by 1,630 forints than last year and the cheapest prices increased by 1,284 forints as well.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic rise in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the data of KSH: for some primary necessities, the Institute of Statistics found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already quite expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to accept the brutal rise in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-lived foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less significant in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overcrowding of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save money on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred at the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident left the hospital but soon after he had to return due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have been unable to perform a major operation due to the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resisting pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Epidemiology Centre.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resisting pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
SA infections (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as a traumatic infection or septicaemia, in elderly, low-weight patients or those with a weakened organism.
According to the director of the hospital J<0xC3><0xA1>nos, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily lives of hospitals.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only or we are not looking for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however, infection cannot always be avoided.
The sampling of the sample is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection manifests mainly in hospitals and in seniors’ residences, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate MRSA-carrying patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases only arise if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has stringent recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words, microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, important gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by inhalation of droplets and by contact, however, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why this infection is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (as well as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a state of intoxication.
The official finding regarding the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, resigning from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of intoxication or deafness, said Friday Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the public ministry of the capital after the relative statement was made.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before he was driving.
On Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd district police station crushed a 55-year-old man who stood in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, into Kossuth Lajos street in the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(In addition, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
A further <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest with a total value of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million budget for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, for which a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million loan contract has already been signed by the parties.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary, with the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft subway line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would reconsider any modification of the initial contract when Hungary finalised the details of the subway financing with the EU.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU's real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undeniably the most popular destination in Eastern Europe with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the shore of the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "C<0xC3><0xB4>te du Soleil", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly also looking for a building in the region of Kavarci and Balci.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, the business and office surfaces promise the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria at the same time seek to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to move in buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old detached houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium or long-term added value.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly rising due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, however, in the last 5 years they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarians
According to the communication of G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals will end on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap intended to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, lively discussions are taking place on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also noted that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss exact figures, but that it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level.
Another important theme of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, apart from reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors likely under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), said Market and Profit.
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, reaffirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent before 2020 from the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the “2012 Agreement”, and it was also willing to take responsibility for their borrowing and developing countries to reduce them by up to 30 per cent and/or other large regions of the world.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and the total of the 15 EU members of that time took the commitment to 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue is great in Bali because the international long-term climate policy agreement must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments of which the international reduction was reported below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol.
Reducing emissions would be delayed and an increase in the Earth’s average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
The units of the British army communicate, on the video-sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who became passionate about YouTube: special units in Afghanistan are uploading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC said.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the headquarters of the air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable.
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net along this route and their “chain” has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence signed up as "defenseheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and communicates videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Ministry of the Commonwealth (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MFI) also have their own.
Missions in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defense, they were also used to make the public aware of the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements passed on to television, said Gordon Mackenzie, a defense consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the well-founded military operations.
The Americans made a game.
The army is upset because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers never present the side do not shy away from talking about the losses but it
By the way, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been packing up for the upload of these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the free downloadable shooting game America's Army. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and beignets in ministries
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by having snacks and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, thus amused the power.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, the family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere at the end of the year.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
GKM’s party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this party, the atmosphere of Christmas will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company that manages tenders.
The building of the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre de la Ga<0xC3><0xAE>té was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to contact the responsible person.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of St. Luke on December 7.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
The ball counted five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance party on live music.
Answer to the question of [origin]: the evening dress was not obligatory at this ball.
The ministries of health, work and local communities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, the Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party, but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eat beignets, the press service said, the party will cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Communities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall with 436 employees expected.
It expects to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, PM employees have celebrated Christmas in the same way every year.
There is no planned party atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas holiday will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the Ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, the respective press services reported to [origin].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health insurance, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The unions of the league will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike committee of LIGA - MOSZ will also be formed, it will serve as the coordinator of Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and, starting Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to find an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health insurance, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on what to do next.
According to Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Cash Act will only take place late at night or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and in the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies may be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil society organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report making the strike for an indefinite period, while others have declared a temporary stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ) failed to find an agreement on minimum services, but as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to the current communications, the public transport of Budapest will strike from the start of service until 13h, the Budapest airport between 7h and 9h in the morning, the Industrial Trade Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will make a strike at the respective hour at the hour of the respective hour at the hour of the lecture, and the 2 teachers' union 2 will strike at the hour of the hour.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second requirement requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the system to pass the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Roadworkers (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Trade Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary rail lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the country's risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyar<0xC5><0x91>sz<0xC3><0xA1>rt Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term, aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-gypsy populations of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tsighans and the Hungarians."
The problem is exacerbated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are reinforced, and aggressive conflicts are more likely to arrive, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard “has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country”.
They recall that, following increased publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, calling themselves the "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, advocacy of the order), armed if necessary," they say, "in addition, referring to politeness."
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the rancor of political society and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil point of view.
The emphasis on the civil character and the association status is therefore not only to avoid the legal traps of registering these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard’s constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many riots of Roma that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense."
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have “terrified” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own guard as resistance indicates an increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, it can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director of Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could impact the change in risk, they inform the public, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian law distinguishes national and state holidays as well as days of rest.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
In one year, we have eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23, which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is the feast of labor and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember the members of our family and friends who died.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state holidays, national or even religious, rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases or there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday preceding the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the replacement days of the days before or after the holidays.
The law applies to all employers and all their employees, to civil servants and to people working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions that run uninterrupted and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to the experiences the majority of people do rather overtime or take vacations that they have saved for those purposes in order to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Next year a lot of parties fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized for the first time around the Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday 18th will be a working day replacing Friday 24th.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six Useless Things That Can Disturb Colleagues Terribly
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that almost bother us anymore: these are things that “beautify” the everyday life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“I’m sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called marketing service,” one colleague told you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, it is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool, or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Do you remember the day before you put the clip on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they’re right to be angry with you for hitting their property.
Do not bring back envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there is no more and you need it right away.
Are you talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop potions that are spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information in you and don’t discuss it with your colleagues in its absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you saying you're sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel sick or you think you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your co-workers!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, remember to notify your boss and colleagues so that they will not be surprised by your absence the next day.
Cooling, Riching, Phone
You dive into your work, but your colleagues' ricination abruptly strips you of it?
Have you become, without wanting to, a witness to a conversation over the phone that you would rather not have listened to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with chills, chanting, loud conversations (which you lead above their heads), kicks, big words, or loud-mouthed discontents.
They can interfere even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (editorial, design, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the set deadline, you forget to send an important letter or message, don’t blame anyone for that!
Do not put it in the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a mistake and if it presented disadvantages to others, correct the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel at home at the office?
Putting a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We move slowly in the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm making the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr2 released Zagar's song Wings of Love.
The Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
But now it seems that the plug is different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new mode of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger came from Pécs and he played in the group of Yonderboi himself before he started his own path, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to be known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
La saison de Ferenc Török).
The formation playing at the beginning in small clubs began to be known to a larger audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would be as competitive.
Zagar and his ensemble have become undeniably “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted properly, it released a new and better album.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new avenues for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the old Pécs group of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
We are well there with the reference to theft but next to aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, rock and roll impact.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs at the debut of the album at Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, Mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained a music targeting a certain layer?
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial and sincere music.
Alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell and become commercial.
But a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only young people in their tens or twentys, but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have taken place in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously happy to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal, but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the unimaginable changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you would no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and made a career rather in the west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music should be compared to that of Yonderboi because there are many of us who leave the band and take a different path.
hvg.hu: In Mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi’s palmar<0xC3><0xA8>s, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the record.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song already existed a long time ago in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The suite of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I even sang the melody that the girls learned later in the night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me back then but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don’t have a role alone, they all sing together and they don’t sing louder than the music, so the music just accompanies their song.
They were behind the scenes too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Honestly, nothing about the music creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything was set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already “released” this record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader cheats on the risk of billions because of its inferiority complex
A dissimilar fraud.
The former employee of the French giant, Société générale, is the owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros to him.
But rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, can in no way be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He's fragile," said his superiors, who reported him to the police.
However, if we take into account Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the man's transactions at the end of last year generated a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis outweighs the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called “sub-prime” mortgages, granted to low-income customers or to those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confided, adding that he had, of course, nothing to keep for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admitted to falsifying the reports so that he would not be screened.
He managed to trick his superiors, although the Eurex stock market began to be interested in his transactions.
He who risks nothing has nothing.
Was he afraid of being discovered?
No, I'm not.
"I felt that the mere fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does your desire to take such a big risk come from?
He did not reach his position until gradually.
He began working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet, he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less respected than the others.
In the face of my university course and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after he took office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the fall of this title in the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, they leave you alone
“There was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I was winning, they were pretending to close their eyes."
This is when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the amount.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out about it?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took 4 days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another,” concludes Kerviel.
Czech Republic on the occasion of obtaining 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This represents about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly CZK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be earmarked for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion under the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a total of SEK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Businesses should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful recipients of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 of a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
However, he was later released and was assigned to reside in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of that Central American state, depending on whether or not he will be re-incarcerated between 1997 and 2002, is currently unclear, according to the AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison agents, or they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or he will go to jail again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n was regularly transferring government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious corporations and the accounts were actually owned by his family members and his closest supporters.
A portion of that money went to the funds that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had created to fund his 2001 election campaign.
The budget has been adopted
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
In what respect is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
This one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the turbulent debate before the vote of the government's declaration of distrust, this time nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted without any problem this law, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, every chapter and every article constitutes the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Disputes of politicians are much more interested in opinion than in abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not fit to settle at once:
The first is the significant share granted to the costs of mandates imposed by law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, he, is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that represents the greatest chance.
This is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds, in vain, indebted excessively to their municipalities, in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits.
In the past years, they managed to repay these debts by mass selling of the shares of distribution systems, in particular those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If it is based solely on official and verifiable facts, it is observed that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, just like the rest of the world.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were indebted to the state more and more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes that have unfortunately inflated unnecessarily in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if a shift in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system, will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be pushed back by mandate costs.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments hadn’t dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give to this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it does to collect taxes and tax duties, the new calm of preparation.
Only the latter will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be placed on the currency markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auctions and will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the central banks of individual states have decided on a concerted action to prevent or even mitigate the effects of the financial crisis.
“This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
“The concerted action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for billions more losses.
“If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they really have to understand what can still happen,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves will have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after it failed to bring down the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual loans, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the central banks will not help conjure up the crisis, since it does not address the main problem that is the fall of the US real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists’ Debates Are Incredible
Global climate change is supposed to be detrimental to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time fell on the UN’s international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, constituted by a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference that there is between rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
“The debate is not structured at all, it’s just a rocket of words, a substitute for solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, in the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often meet only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested people can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic who is able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics, and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of it are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all the researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are not incomplete, the effects of the current changes are not too important or too serious, they represent not too serious.
Especially with the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integral environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profits they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about it two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 People Failed to Renew Their Driving Licence in Time
Six hundred thousand drivers left the deadline and failed to renew their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid driver’s license will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driver's license especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for the renewal of the permit, authorities in the capital are invading applications and the number of applications for the renewal of the permit has gone up this week.
The City Hall serves about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour away.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the release within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete the mandatory renewal of the driver's license by the end of the year and if we take the road without a valid driver's license, will face a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to SEK 2,500.
According to previous information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 kroner.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines of tens of thousands.
According to him, a driver’s license is a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the identity card which, it, must be valid without exception.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
All you have to do is bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of the detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Kona<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, former police officers accused of connivance with David Berdych's gang, will serve thirteen and ten years in prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague has thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, detectives from the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime were facing 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is conceivable.
Although Berdych is also indicted in the case, he is currently awaiting a first-instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials, the amount of which exceeds 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found 19 people guilty of participating in hold-ups, and the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants had been questioning the charge since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemia Court of Justice, after an agreement with Berdych, police members, among other things, were transmitting to criminals information from police sources, covering the various hold-ups and helping gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang remitted 30 percent of the larceny to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>ar<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment deals with the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, the victims of which have, in most cases, suffered serious harm to health, but also the abuse of power of a public officer and prohibited armament.
During home searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser direct-shooter or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has been enriched with tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already pleaded guilty to other hand-lifted Berdych thefts and a number of other people.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet come to court.
At the main hearing, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are currently in detention in Ireland, have been avoided, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the injured families, wants compensation of 12 million crowns plus expenses from the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, this one is very high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said at the exit of the hearing.
"In order to be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report of which the opposing party has commanded the drafting.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov's family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document supporting the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, themselves, remain less serene in the face of the trauma experienced in the current situation and in the face of what is happening at this very moment, summed up the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il region handed over 100,000 crowns to each family for reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are subject to the Civil Liability Insurance Act.
In case of failure, they must draw in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Up to now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, with the sums calculated according to the tables being hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
The Kingdom of Wallachia (the Kingdom of Wallachia)
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka a perdu le litige au sobre de la marque Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD> (Royaume de Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was he who had actually used the title of King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, former collaborator of the actor.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not present at today's hearing.
Now, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone exactly this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There’s a job that’s been behind us for almost ten years.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> kr<0xC3><0xA1>l (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> was crowned king in 1993.
But at the time, this had nothing to do with the plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of making the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD> passports appear.
From a humorous action originally came a lucrative business and business activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed that his name and signature be mentioned in the passport and he even offered to the holders of the balances on the price of the visit to his farm and his theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the nude idea, published by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in the mane<0xC5><0xBE> program, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and certainly aidée le projet Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD>," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was composed of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense way.
The collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated with the deposition "of King Boleslav I elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as the Mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, requesting that the court today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and a half of the princess.
There should be a new king.
He did not yet want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slov<0xC3><0xA1>cko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can, of course, register,” Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many respects, be classified as lower than average.
The Peugeot 207 is the successor to the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
The more the combi called SW goes a step further, I just have to think about it.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained, for example, of the head space on the rear seats.
While there you finish the complaints because the bodywork combi means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see quickly done
I'm going to talk about the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is an almost successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about too short seats or backrests is over.
The lateral guide has also significantly improved with respect to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is also noticeable here.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A coffin in the coffin
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage rack.
I have to rate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the back pivoting ice) and a rather easy grip.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop tyres which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold heavy enough objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure relative to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If you compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, you can see that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to bring out the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box left after the reverse of the rear seats perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an Otto four-cylinder engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, this is what should look like a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback work.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda that often gives the impression of having an exhaust pot clogged by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by everyone.
However, we must be aware that we tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-liter Otto engine amounting to 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still reasonable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That’s a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the Fabia price and you’ll get a very similar figure.
So all you have to do is choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is bad
The number of children originating from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which raises concerns among the remaining population about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is, for the time being, facing a number of obstacles.
There are even cases in British schools where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous peoples turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the ongoing conflict between the Slovak immigrants and immigrants is beginning to escalate, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicane and quarrels between students have transposed into the relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenage girls.
The young girls had allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“When we got home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he replied with apples and pears and then he discovered his butts," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went so far as to qualify conflicts with immigrants to fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can come true if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or some intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transfer of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very beginning of the 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings pushed and cars, belonging to cult symbols of the 1950s, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco from Paula, near Havana, and, in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you can mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since jigoulis and fiats once imported have already long since, in such a salty and humid climate, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decrepit, nowhere else in the surroundings are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extended plantations in the confectionery on a narrow path by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives whose contemporaries are not only in museums can be seen on the go.
Where to lead his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that those who love this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vinales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows there on a limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balls and rocks rise in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, having taken fertile land in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is probably the place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman’s Chilean episode was filmed.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought glory and wealth to the market.
Wealth embodied in the beauty and city-vitrine character of this small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has almost not changed in the course of four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that still in the 1950s, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the sidelines.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth going to see also interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which is animated after sunset and where the music is only heard in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this hamlet located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads that lead there from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape with almost no sign of human activity.
UNESCO has listed the East of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, you can see several mountains El Castillo is the main table,
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain massif, the Bay of Wheat and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, any African religions practiced by one of the descendants of the ancestors.
Only, as they say, it is better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say the Americans
The lack of troops and necessary equipment influences, according to the United States, the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going as it should, representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the U.S. this week, through Defense Minister Robert Gates, called for greater activity by NATO troops, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government’s authority and intensifying development aid.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Forty-nine percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to the U.S. military, the most intense of the past five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, to 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which nearly a quarter are in the southern part.
Now, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
“We will need to think seriously about concrete goals for the upcoming period, as well as ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts between countries involved in the question of whether all allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements to which they are subject are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers a coward this week.
"Afghan thugs discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on to counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British squad during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The debt of the state will amount to one billion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 kroner is borne by each Czech.
The total debt rose at the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
Thanks to a better-than-expected economy of the state budget, the ministry reduced the projected amount to CZK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the state of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of this year, it therefore increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, as of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 kroner is on each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than 111 billion kroner.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could exceed the 1 billion kroons limit only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion kroner,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikor’s prediction is similar: “We could exceed one billion by 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that the policies were ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don't expect that change," he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The debt of the State is financed by treasury bonds, pension bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The state’s external debt has increased this year from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and from June it decreased by SEK 13.7 billion.
The average debt liability of the State amounted to 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased year-on-year from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by pension securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be matter to negotiate when pension reform comes,” Picora said.
Better than what we were expecting
It follows from the government's financing and debt management strategy for 2007, which the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the state budget, the ministry reduced the projected amount to CZK 152.8 billion.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the state budget, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the initially planned 91.3 billion kroner.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion kroner, the 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government pension securities for 43 billion kroner, and the repayments of billions of euro bank loans.
She was compared today to a court in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting 6- to 7-year-olds give Muhammad's name to a teddy bear while any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punishable by a whipping sentence.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher at Khartoum's Unity High School in Sudan was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under section 125 of the Sudan Penal Code following several complaints from children's parents about the child's smuggling.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the plush bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s director.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with a picture of the bear followed by the legend “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name.”
A statement shared by many pupils of the schoolgirl who described her as "very attentive to her pupils" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the surname Mohamed is also the second most given surname in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a news conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“There is no immediate violence, but we are entering a very difficult period,” he said, adding that “evident tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, which is home to 90% Albanians, could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was charged with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, are insisting that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence ?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the West believes that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina says it is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not vote in its favour.
Belgrade is insisting on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu said at the hotel in Baden, where the “last chance talks” were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade says it fears a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
“For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be made exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
“The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word”
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that “the Parliament of Kosovo will have the final word on the status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made “in consultation” with the Westerners.
Bush scraps deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference, which he met in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised he would do anything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “roadmap” for peace they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including key issues.”
This appellation covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others.”
Standing on the stand, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his “two-state vision” of Palestinian and Israeli co-existing.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it had made a commitment to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the root of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi-based Arabic-language daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
So, what exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspector General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but in patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare,” a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to drive on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was "very vivid".
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right,” one police officer said.
The alcohol control carried out on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before crashed, starry windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that she has entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assistance to anyone in danger" to the IGPN, co-sponsored with the departmental directorate of the Val'Od-Public Security.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed “the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left”.
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained enclosed as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the places very quickly, thus not lending relief to the two young people.
IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “serious faults” in this regard.
“This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we need to be very careful,” a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows overlooking the stage.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to resuscitate them,” the witness said.
There was nothing to be done.”
He then saw “a completely horny policeman, who was drinking.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present in the unexpected situation of the youth, the policemen were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the departure of the police.”
They also performed heart massages in vain.
“I will not let you say that the police services did not provide assistance to the youth.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed the first protests on Monday since General Musharraf established a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the state of emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, barristers from the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyer movement on Monday gathered the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "emphasized the people to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and debris to those who'll take oath to Mu'sha.
“Musharraf’s promise is no longer fulfilled.”
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly targeted by the exceptional measure announced Saturday evening.
It was to decide in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf’s presidential re-election, on October 6, by indirect vote.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the army and become a civilian president “is no longer holding” after the state of emergency was established, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denounced rumours in the country that President Musharraf has been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of army.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates the Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless led to a better "control of fertility", according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Or calculated on a monthly basis for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was conceived, tools “briculated” by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday as astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical part that will soon accommodate European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, in order to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module's solar panels, which have a range of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged over nearly a meter by a cable that stuck.
Deployment was stopped in order not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to perform a control exit of the Discovery shuttle, then go and repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go sniffing at the end of the 30-meter length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, durable, very straight, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore tasked with “operating” the “injured” solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed some sort of "attachments" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the sas and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey rod wrapped in insulator to avoid electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricked" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Upon completion of the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and reclaiming the station's interior.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts reclaim the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS stock is currently down on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group announced it would have to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 and 1.4 billion to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to revise its 2007 operating profit forecast due to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M's engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of tackling the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is “between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus,” the parent company of European manufacturer EADS said.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit (EBIT) targets for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds, without further details.
The group also indicated that the estimation of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS's operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days after the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sent a televised message to voters on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the list of united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president made nothing clear by receiving foreign ambassadors, just delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without hooks,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from account.
She denounces a campaign full of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said there had never been such a dirty election, even in the days of Eltsine.
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the mindset of the homo sovietius.”
Behind these unstressed legislations there are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
However, no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful united Russian party who would choose the government and the president?
Either way, both in the legislature and in the presidential election, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel master of their destiny,” said Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society has been delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin reconnected with the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease,” says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “willfully renounce the personal responsibility” that they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
“What good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What good to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory.
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were thus far only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or its rightholders.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research “in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers,” said Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, objected to the public opening of these nomination documents, owing to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to forced labour and, where appropriate, to provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, the bilateral Indo-European trade already amounts to nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers had given their green light to the European Commission last April to start negotiations to sign Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact will greatly dope both economies” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million thriving Europeans,” Mandelson said.
The European Commission represents the first or second pre-emptive market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants traded for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "several ten billion euros of services" to the European market.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday it was anxious to ease the current return on credit concerns, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its reserves during the current period," the Bank said in a statement.
The bank says that 10 billion pounds (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time the BoE appears to be placing on the five-week liquidity market in an open market operation.
These usually take place within a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is “prepared to take further measures to maintain rates” of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had discouraged banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more discretion.
UMP and NC Refuse to Consider PS Propositions on Purchasing Power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss articles on the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "nice" (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text rejected about a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, among which the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a check-transport or the management
With both UMP and NC voting against the consideration of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in a, sometimes vivid, majority-to-oppose exchange within a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MEP leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the bill on amending finances discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has, no more and no less, inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as “the most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we have been caught up in politicking because of the current administration,” continued Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after being featured in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in an urban setting.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are rather held in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival to the European and urban to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states that "they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of the festival is “very large,” as is the capacity of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations to the bands were launched, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to the press.
“Vineland will taste like rock, but the music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
Its C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montréal confronts the Terminator
It's not easy to attract the Hollywood film rinks to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of a delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the Governor’s feet?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he said.
The Race to the Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote cinema from here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be from all the festivals of the West Side, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Québec films, showcase them and make sure the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional rally at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties persist in the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nurtured by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the same period of time as the lack of quality alternatives with guarantees".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather side-by-side behavior, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in the Fed's rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of sales for BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," the expert says.
Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost almost 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution holiday (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to technical levels and that is why we could see a rebound in the index that could be caused based on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.”
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum ratings.
Intermoney’s Solana says, “This year the great values are back for him.”
The expert would include the two major banks and a few manufacturers in the portfolio "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get into it.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” he said.
Cyclical consumption will play a major role in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
For the past seven years, December has been a downward month on only two occasions.
The Authentic Year-End Rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (currently Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it is computer-successful at its end-of-year rally.
La Banque Populare will open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday at 12:00 p.m.
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its subsidiaries, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for other agencies to adhere to this initiative that coincides with business hours.
This is exactly what the People’s Bank is looking for.
Attracting self-employed customers who travel to these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and the shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but a renovation of the existing ones.
To do this, the agency will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank’s commercial manager, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People’s Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and with success, according to Rivero.
The People’s Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've made it.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco CEO, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect of his joy was: “What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more, but that we have decreased less,” he said.
However, he emphasized the fact that on a weak market, ‘we’ve fallen less’.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (an additional 13%) thus reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which sold 1.52% yesterday and has been down 40.5% since January, cost half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other publicly traded communications companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience."
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
For this to be true, the TV channel is expected to see a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year compared to $965.4 million for the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Antenne 3’s net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million) while television’s net revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the analysts point to the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise to give at least 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This, they explain, is due to the decrease in projected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of Antenna 3's earnings to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Congress approves Mifid transposition, which came into force on 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress' vote of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations so that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consultancy services for both specialised social and legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (FIAs), which merge securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which face competition from current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Passing through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that highlights that the debt held will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proven itself with what happened with the (high-priced) US mortgage debt.
In addition, they took advantage of the implementation of the management has taken advantage of legally delimiting the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after, in 1977, was approved, the Royal Decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV, and who will be able to lend its product marketing and customer attraction services to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized consumer price index rises five-tenths in November to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policies of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and minister of the economy, Pedro Solbes, said the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the corridors of the Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
“We were hoping for a figure of around 4%,” the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, he had amassed some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months due to the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited over the next three years to get those remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18,000 million until reaching the goal of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 million.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Suspected Urban Corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) earlier this morning because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption scheme discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council secretaries and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'maneuver' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the city council and the possibility of further arrests in the coming hours is not ruled out.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cha<0xC3><0xAE>ne SER indicated yesterday to the lawyer of the member of the 'people's party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession regarding the plot.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party’s candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish socialist party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the case of the Socialists.
Thus the organization secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of that party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as president of the Congress, which on November 15 made public his decision not to run for the next general election and to give up his political career to dedicate himself to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political avant-garde since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that while citizens already know who the economic vice-president will be if the Spanish Socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or screaming" and make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems sadly that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate has on some occasions been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his know how to do" and he did not want to pretend he was already in his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
A Climate Propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to relentless persecution by both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's being at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-execution, in what sectors has it occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be forced to make, what economic consequences will this bring.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of businesses and individuals.
Up to one-hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him literaryly so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is only a purely virtual contracting party and that does not claim that we are moving on a bicycle or refreshing ourselves with the range.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged scheme of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, informed the sources of the qu<0xC3><0xAA>n.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the Function of Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the last Galician company Nuaria could build 4,000 homes, after the payment of commissions.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which Totana's Tribunal No. 1 instructs.
The first six detainees have been brought to justice today.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently an autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the wine pots would have been realized.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, have carried out eleven inspections, the majority of which are in prison-related companies located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, and Las Rozas.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known avian product company in the region, which may have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been requalified and its project is expected to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, which promotes the installation of direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the construction.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (some leading PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day he appeared Black's book, there's a cry from there.
"The content of the Philosophy course has questioned public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor’s student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction to the Penal Code of offences on downloads on the Internet:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime punishable by a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store up to a value of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to engage in a fight than to engage in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorised films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real then someone exaggerates.

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research titled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less'.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly wage of the workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the neurocognition imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that when both people were guessing that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with a bitter taste, because the main officials responsible for the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died-, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader Serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still at liberty.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, ' Carla's list ' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who reprimands the government for the prosecution of the criminals in evacuation.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible damages, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the driver's license, the civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use it is made, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return it becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, driver's license age, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the odds to pay.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of damages due to their precautionary nature.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
It is for this reason that the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the insurer's characteristics, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 have to face various drawbacks when entering into an affordable insurance contract, such as low driving experience and a driver’s license’s seniority.
Although the ideal to be well insured is a risk-free insurance, other more economical options exist.
The most foreseeable drivers can opt for any risk insurance with franchise, so that they get the coverage of any risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
“The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower,” says Luis Noguera, Spain’s head of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damages caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be cautious and avoid damages as far as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, which may reduce the price of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"Bonus and penalties will depend on the company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses,” clarifies Noguera.
Over the age of 25, this becomes easier for drivers at the time of entering into a contract with an insurance company, since the rate of damages is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose a risk insurance with deductible.
"Normally, young people can't benefit from the experience previously acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the persons with the lowest claims rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be any risk insurance with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have a more relaxed drive and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchises,” Judge Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, a full-risk insurance with deductible is preferable (being 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will meet next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the Champions League closing, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to be first.
The Italians totaled ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
The two Group D matches will be played one week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC is due to compete in the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that if they win in the finals it will stay first.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but she won't be able to computer only on that because with nine points the game comes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week at Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth final for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the 'rossoneri' victory, the victory would only come to Shakhtar, in case the Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth round of the final in order to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and with no chance to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, since the group disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver.
Around 20,000 people used up the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that raged in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that resumes their major hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that 'Posh Spice's husband had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowd that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he'll think of the show".
Sporty Spice, who was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and who caused the group to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also remarked that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last exhibited in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitter was waiting for them.
She has five sons and seven sons.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be exhibiting in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine throws off the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly company supplying gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would raise its prices to Ukraine as planned since it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean a 40% increase in the cost of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
“It is essential for us to use all of our arguments during the talks, reminding us that we are a country through which most of the gas transits,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would undoubtedly be related to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused Gazprom's supply to Ukraine to be interrupted.
This has led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the largest stockpiles of gas, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health must improve checks to be carried out on its extra-community employees to check if they have a criminal record, the monitoring committee said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health had no precise data on the number of overseas workers employed by the Ministry of Health.
Its report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-community personnel following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing with his jeep at the gates of the main terminal.
He was among the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, as they were suspected of being involved in various car bombing attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will need to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of the UK.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Bureau of Criminal Records, thus allowing employers to undertake controls on various countries.
“While we have found that some staff information has been well verified, this is not done every time,” the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to the health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
“The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings may bring any added value.”
The Scottish health authorities have said they employ 1,161 people overseas, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems with the identification of indefinitely contracted staff members, who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for inspections by the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and pre-employment control system for overseas staff members of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government allied to the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better execution of the recently updated pre-employment checks, and valid for all employees, including those from overseas.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on Joy Division's latest singer, Ian Curts, has won 5 awards, including the best film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in the film, directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Mrs. Judi Dench has been nominated for Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under international reflectors.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control recounts the rise to success of Curtis with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black and white film, which was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, has won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best beginner director.
The Rock was also awarded the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple's Clash Singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor Award was presented to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mob boss, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his bold character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The fiftieth-year-old director, having filmed films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, Kingdom of the Skull of Crystal.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of the star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.
“I was admiring this great current actor, I was extremely honored.”
The Oscars for the independent film, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Fans and patrons of Bifa include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrorist Conspiracies
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells maneuvering an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastical and armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper cited a statement from the interior minister, saying 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the detainees appear to have committed the murder of ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The government has urged ecclesiastical leaders to do more against the Saudis in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the Muslim Shiite government allied to the United States, considered heretical according to the hardline line of the Saudis Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the Saudi pro-Western government by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months,” the interior minister’s spokeswoman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” to promote “tankfiri thinking”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel Muslims and apostates.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with a slower rotation has led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is devoid of water, is devastated by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor of physics at the University of Oxford Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have originally been identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
One kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to date as a presidential candidate, to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats about their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected much of the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate for the next election.
It is not known on what criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show the candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest one-topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the strong topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear funny things: The board noted increases in approval when the candidates spoke rudely.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney, who leads the big early Iowa and New Hampshire elections.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about clandestine immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when they were asked if they would be prepared to promote "amnesia" (providing illegals with regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be due to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: tighter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other topics have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for arms control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in the content of the Bible in its entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, who was at the pole position in Iowa in a recent election, due to his long-standing Christian conservatism, declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to stand for election.
The human race is unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for grants led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday’s debate.
These two have emerged from nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party fail to agree to decide who is the best-known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party in a timely and convincing manner with a message of success about American greatness bringing leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No sold decorations, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no extra slutty marital toe.
But here is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have disguised his contributions to the current Labour Party under false names for four years, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have paid for.
Two months ago, the prime minister stepped back in his draft election, stupidly insulting British intelligence declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty at the edge of the crack, has demonstrated a flaw in the guidelines and a poor judgment in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against military spending cuts: they have proclaimed that being a defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of lukewarm donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Workers (and his former head of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading out.
However, governments can come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even rule for long, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers do the check; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes on the defensive and no longer any purpose.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
Problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such a long investigation into the party’s funds “of money for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic as it seems.
The giggles are not as monstrous as the Tories party members make it seem.
As in Mr. Bean, there is no victim or fraud.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to put Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies into practice forever, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big donors of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, not knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collections who spoke about the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests he was aware of these procedures, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to an investigative committee on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it's up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financials of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the Confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But it should deal with some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to reconquer voters, and the only way to achieve a victory is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis pollute the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see attached swimmers, whirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measure unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It is too early to panic.
The costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in the United States in 2005, regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp drop in bankrupt records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions had to be imposed.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct link of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers may prefer to increase their debts now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash rather than the value of the property, and therefore the fall in property prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to the issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to repay everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgage providers and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of having a quick recovery of the shares.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, CEO of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a consequent decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a sluggish future.
Be careful with the back fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to witness their roles in connection with a fraud committed by Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But at a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout the UK due to two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that were made against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The indictments against the bankers, dubbed the "three of Natwest" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him trick bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had assessed its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British are already aware of its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the subsidiary’s bank interest for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, those $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers reportedly earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others reportedly earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two plots in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is jailed for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a $1 million bail each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh-largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debts or even offer its junk speculations as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion in market value loss and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Lay's accusations of conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were in vain because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Neither under nor outside of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats as it is more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Salon des Millionaires, a four-day consumer incentive orgy, held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to arouse interest from the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was scrutinizing a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second-largest private jet market.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 70s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians emerge as the world’s largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103 billion Russian millionaires who total $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative for Davis Morris, a London jeweller.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents bet on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, declare to be like their clients, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who wore her high-heeled dress like a veteran of the red carpet like Joan Rivers.
The show seems above all to be aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the plugs to come up to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum cannulas, ice cream peluches Mövenpick, our custom billiard tables, and custom billiard tables.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal Dutch porcelain factory stand Delf, in front of a Rainbow mural on blue tiles, handmade.
“The Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
In fact, sellers here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too old according to Russian standards) have already switched from flashy logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, are renting the exhibition every day.
Some even buy it.
During the first night of the exhibition, on Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses embedded with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said it had sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of strawberry leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will definitely keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in property prices here.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company has erected four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Show.
Passers arrested to launch masses of bills, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or poaching a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unapproved Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and watched an ambulance stop at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant official, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of Ms. Arroyo’s death, but they are waiting confident, the results of toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which should help solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hard-working and persistent,” McCarthy said of Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died due to an unauthorized surgery.
“This is an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation is going on.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and having found Melle Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Ms. Castro's home where a faded rose rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian was barking at the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two bikes all terrain hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandoning her political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to be careful about this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower the rates associated with the fluctuation of the global stock market.
Stocks exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the US Vice President’s calming statements.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, <0x23>2 after Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve President, said those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in troubled financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Mr Kohn said the recent turbulence has partially “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this severe turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the U.S. markets, and that further declines in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks have also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the US economy, such as the biggest drop in property sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to offset the heavy losses due to the losing bets of immobili borrowers.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, 2,55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a monthly auction of funds by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions, has caused the British banks to borrow three-monthly "Libor" loans since November 12, causing their highest growth rate of 9% after a 6-month increase in September last year.
England is facing an appeal to judgement against critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 batsman for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the president general manager of England, begins to fill out the application forms at the lesser time to become a national selector.
He who will not be able to win backscorer <0x23>6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is too.
It is never easy to destroy what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the lower level, sometimes out of a lack of luck more than out of a lack of skill.
It’s not just cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is the right time to pop up Bopara?
Is this fair to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee “tubby”?; both new executives having obtained good, professional degrees should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless given at least one chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions, but also the opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a batsman must be lucky to touch the cricketer of a day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
Whether it is Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium is just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who still managed to become the primordial cricketer of the Test, and this is in australia, despite the fact that his double cent scored against.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah’s greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start to the Test innings of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah only made ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his midsex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious bounties at Bomba.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently capped on a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He only reported minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from a distance, to ask him if “Did he see that?”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his spinning look allows him to do services that go him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Is this the true art of selection?
I would be willing to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean that Shah shouldn’t apply if, as tea leaves suggest, he’ll play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, expelling those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has regained normalcy.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have driven them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival in Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, has returned home with his two children, as he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and as the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-backed militia allowed him to chase Al Qaeda out of the western capital, and invited him to return home.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad due to a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rebel against Al Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the growing calm of the capital since U.S. troops arrived, and to the prospect of continuing training well-armed “citizen groups” and collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, who allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people into the country.
More than two and a half million people are reported to have fled the country due to sectarian death squads.
“We didn’t have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to no longer give visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The drop in violence may be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring fighting back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in the field of vocational training, and even excels in the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deprecation, posters for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Saar also leads the children of the country to higher schools in number above the average - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
“In Saarland, we benefit from the vocational training system,” says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saar is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double-course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarrois has forced the higher schools to a marketing campaign in the engineering sciences.
“After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in the general schools,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is exempt from the law - a model that other federal states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether the performance of students is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Sarroids, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise you could earn points in this area.
Because the neighbour's language is mandatory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chavez adjusts the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the half-hour timer in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, the watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez justified his position among other things by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that while conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do it, already only because of my dignity,” said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote through a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "crashed Venezuela's face" with the decision, Chavez said Sunday.
In Spain too, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is in every mouth.
A new cell phone ringtone rages in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant appeals of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjuncture, according to one forecast, a real minus value of the salary threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to see a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
“The fault lies with the low wage development, the increase in the value-added tax and the rise in food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told Bild.
New charges could also be incurred in respect of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected reduction in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credit or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus resembles Earth more than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind gusts at the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning strikes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today brought the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: flashes on Venus explode at an altitude of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Magaenti "Christopher Russel of the University of Los Sicily in California.
According to the famous cyprin theory, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should be little living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it remains a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, as no probe was on its way to the exploration of this planet since the 1990s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more than initially assumed.
Thus, in addition to the wind turbines already known at the north pole, the researchers found a cloud turbine at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly remembers Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for an end to the parties’ dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and sums up the large coalition to close the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed sympathy for the welcome of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should keep a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional politics of a single China.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, about the CDU’s “front-line policy” on foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese government not only decommissioned German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from the Spiegel, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive Tibet’s spiritual leader in their official positions, Wen Jiabao said.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, shooting, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like those in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt on the streets by violence, the German Interior Minister demanded.
Barricades burning, burglars shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We need to make sure that a social explosive does not build up in our own homes as well and unleashed itself in violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this already shows its early successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems nor from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had been engaged in serious street battles with police over the past few nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
This is what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded from the German government for greater integration efforts.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need for action.
Kolat emphasizes that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigration would be above average.
First of all, more places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish Communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also don’t want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, “But we must still be careful.”
It should "give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
Authorities have reported three arrests as well as a few cars and garbage incinerated.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the riots exploded in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the background – and that there’s nothing to expect from her anymore.
In which country does the Chancellor live?
After her deplorable intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that should ultimately be governed by it.
The accusation of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel in a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed there that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made visible to everyone how accurate this accusation was.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a heavier politician, who escapes into foreign policy and who even stays in the closet.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements over and over again, but does not say how climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even self-loathing – having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused to do so two years ago.
Now it clings to all-made formulas, which growth would affect people.
In this way she destroys her image of a pragmatist, who solves problems rather than beautify the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional sentences for that.
In this respect, it is revealing how many times she makes lapses when it comes to family allowances.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to pronounce a precise half-sentence.
It's on unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already erupts on the first subject.
It would have made New York a "refugee for illegals," Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The former governor of Massachusetts, Giuliani, said, “I would say his own house was an oasis for illegal immigrants,” and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates come to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
“It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,” McCain said to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being vigorously taught by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg City Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause pours out into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are revealed once again.
"I made a mistake at the time," Romney said, apologizing to the base and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, passes into a flowing node when asked about his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns civilian for the first time.
A day after he retired as army chief, Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army are over.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his role as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus folded to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his takeover by a coup without bloodshed, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By withdrawing from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to an army spokesperson, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The fathers of the Krautrock are back.
Germany’s supergroups of the 1970s are reuniting: the three members of the band Harmonia have again taken to their console at a concert in Berlin.
For their return came recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much more well-known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the poster of the evening.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old boy with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, watched by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes this inadvertently adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to be too disturbing to the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again has caused some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to unveil it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name makes sense in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why wouldn’t the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room questioning.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in panegyric praise, the surprise was limitless.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this period, the power of impact that felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
It was first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly worked in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians into exile in the forests of the Weserbergland.
There, in a former Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Commune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
There was a fanion of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many have kept Harmony away from it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvest of the dead wood was not for himself alone in search of himself.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone thinks to remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
Griessem's Live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Her label Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been excavated on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia’s physical resurrection takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of the Krautrock would be enshrined with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase is in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: “The only true music, you listen to the future”.
There are pictures that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of bazaar wired tools serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the drum, to shoot the instruments from unheard-of sounds thanks to the instruments with self-built effects.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in big technical figurines.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and one sings at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts “68” is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also does not let himself be irritated by it anymore.
But what goes best will be covered in detail on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can tap on someone’s nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderful Peace", two films once again address the Balkan War.
But the two do not convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of foolish shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the darkest hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had in the last place lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many kind and futile roles in women's sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why do today's movies have to be as long and confusing as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a beautiful performance full of eyelashes: at the bottom, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time, but who has his best moments left behind.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murderful Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless sequel to failed films about the Balkan war.
From "Murderful Peace" one can quickly make the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two soon falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented for once as the only causes of all evil, this film as flat as a television movie gets lost too quickly in the action and the exchanges of foolish shots.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can look at in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the background there has never been a really good movie about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are packed to track down the top war criminal “the fox,” might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at some other time a new “Apocalypse Now”.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something the military can’t do and for both males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we just don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as it was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, it is achieved that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have not succeeded in five years: catching the bounty hunter and leaving him alone.
It is so bad that we should appeal to the Hague International Court of Crime against Cinematographic Logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at liberty, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt in a fairly intensive manner due to secret political agreements.
But the good intention and the bad are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately, I see the veins of the forehead inflated, clearly: how tiresome it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tingling heads, but that hint at how tiresome it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
One might add: there have never been any good films about South Africa before.
Which is worth every time: when a star drags on a crisis house or on a minefield, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits gehen Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie with Schindler's List.
Some films still have to mature - those that are worth classic works on Vietnam today "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were in no way unanimously celebrated at their time as masterpieces.
But maybe today we also know just too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it pleases the writers the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Dictator" actually became as good as that because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It only depends on the fact that some things never change."
“Great cities will always be terribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has criticised the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's resignation with Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics has clashed in politics and the economy with critical virulence.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the waterfront.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday described an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivating forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sports momentum could not have been maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point for it in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides to run for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation at the beginning of December, about Munich’s candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance."
However, the dream is not definitively a thing of the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
From this it would seem that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now,” said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would further contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the welcome to the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg’s 2015 Universiade bid as “not a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor’s SPD faction has accused the Senate of not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
“The development of Little Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic card and excluded housing construction,” SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always called for Little Grasbrook to have a plan integrated into the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg, for its part, would have raised great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
They're not Warhol's cash registers.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and the wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
A large part of the eighty Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today results in a great result that "six cents" of the "Brillo-Boxes" are the "Circles" of the "Brillo-Boxes", of which the "Circle" of the "Brillo-Boxes" is a direct.
The ancient history is entwined, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - presented hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not a question of works of art, but rather of their models, of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered right into the history of art and auctions, as Andy Warhol's original Brillo-Boxes authorized, with the appellation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén wrongly claimed later that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later cede to him.
In fact, the 105 boxes of Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the museum’s six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and punctured in white.
The texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a background layer on the laminate panels, using a paint roller - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York's 'Modern' and 'Modern' Art Authentication Board' will not be a different decision.
Already in July, the Authentication Board has of course announced that it will investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila are abandoning
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers give up, the same ones who had retreated to a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he would not be able to answer for any bloodshed.
Loyal soldiers in power had raided the hotel shortly before using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had cut themselves off for hours in the building.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to an attempted putsch that was missed in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse with about 30 supporters.
The military police officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and had joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power circled the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillans said.
“We’re calling on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded the Scout Rangers’ elite unit, said that other units of the army would soon join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The Manila Financial District has been the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke out almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a more than 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We’ve speculated about a buyback before.
The option would remain open to further increase the participation in Versatel.
With this step, we are looking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has put 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought $5.15 million for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.1 million.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to donate an additional 18.49 percent to Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, especially increasing their participation in the Freenet SA, it has been learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The still difficult to predict poker on Freenet that lasts for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet and Drillisch Holding held a 6.01 percent direct stake in Freenet so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring about four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
