Members of the House of Representatives in Wales are afraid to look stupid
Some MEPs are confused about the proposal that MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) should be changed to their name.
The court began with a plan to change the name of the delegation to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the House of Representatives, regardless of the party, are concerned that the change may make them a target of ridicule.
According to a Labour Party representative, the group is concerned that the name "smarts with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means cock.
According to a Plaid party representative, the group's majority "is not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a representative of the Conservative Party, his group views the name change "openly", but points out that the word MWP is a short verbal verb to the word meaning stupid.
In Wales, the w-letter is pronounced in this context in a similar way to the Yorkshire English u-letter.
The Commission, which is currently drafting the legislative amendment required for the change of name, stated: "The final decision on the titles describing the members of the delegation is of course up to the members themselves."
The Law on the Administration of Wales of 2017 gives the delegation the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of the representative body as the Welsh Parliament would be widely supported.
The Commission preferred the Wales MEPs or the shorthand WMP to be valued by MEPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
Members of the House are apparently proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus can lead to a headwind for President Elin Jones, who is expected to come up with a bill of amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also contains other changes to the functioning of the Agency, such as the rules on the loss of representation and the format of the committee system.
In the legislative debate, the members of the delegation can give their final vote on what title they should be called to.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is aimed at resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the North Neighbourhood is practically a regional requirement of its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU-NATO membership efforts.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of a referendum like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that a change of name is simply a price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Watches Quiet as Harlem Churches Live in Difficult Times
“The elderly people I’ve talked to say that before every corner of the street there was a bar or church,” Adams says.
"There's none today."
He said the loss of bars is understandable.
He said, “People’s interactions have changed.”
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood’s common living rooms where people meet regularly.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not carry as much as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the starting line."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not those inhabited by people who would support the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“The unconditional majority of people who buy homes from these buildings will be white,” he says, “and thus they will have to face the day when these churches will shut their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments would become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a Black community – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original Methodist church of whites moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby congregation of Negroes acquired the building as their property.
St Martins took over the congregation of Negroes under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of Harlem's central shopping street 125th Street merchants against their opposition to hiring or promoting Negroes.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson’s congregation members planned to rebuild it, they introduced a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father and successor in St. Martin’s, proudly called the game “the bells of the poor.”
An expert who played the game in July called it a "cultural treasure" and an "invaluable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first black-and-white music towering game, which was played by Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to Riverside 18 years ago to play a larger towering game.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins, a complex rift has developed in recent months, involving architects and contractors hired by the church’s secular leaders and, on the other hand, by the episcopal diocese.
Sakasti - the governing body of the church's earthly leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to cover the costs" of the saxophone, even though the saxophone had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency regarding the diocese.
Hai Hurt 13-Year-Old Hummer Scout in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before seven o'clock in the morning.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help.
Hammel said he thought the boy was only excited after catching the lobster, but then realized that he was yelling, “I was fucked!”
They carried me!'
Upon reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire solitary bone had been torn open.
"I called everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady's children's hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of shark that attacked is not known.
Captain Larry Giles, the lifeguard, said at a media event that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper arm.
Officials closed the beaches of Casablanca from Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's to the UK's beauty industry
Sainsbury’s challenges with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams-style departments of beauty care with expert advisors.
This is a significant move for the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty industry in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow even as the sales of fashion and household goods are declining. Larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country, and when they succeed, they will not be able to sell them again.
Beauty products are being invested as supermarkets seek to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s says its beauty product range has doubled to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space, and they will get their own brand-specific area like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers demand it more and more.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop’s fragrance chain is testing rental stores at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift from grocery shopping to small one-off purchases will force supermarkets to invent new attractions for customers.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores, plus Habitat stores, which the company says has promoted food sales and made a profit from acquisitions.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds of supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy follows a corporate deal where Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds is part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skincare products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in employees who have received special training, who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand range meets all needs and our attractive environment and convenient location make us a compelling beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "in anger" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left “in his rage” when TV star Holly Willoughby withdrew from an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their food and accessories brand for True.
The twin company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old singer of This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by retiring from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute, and she now intends to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "annoyed" last Tuesday at a tense meeting held at the headquarters of Jones's business empire in Marlow, Buckinhamshire, the TV star girl had admitted that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of deals were not worth living for them.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, "Truth was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which was to ensure his performance for the next two decades.
His final decision has left everyone in awe of him.
No one could believe Tuesday’s events so close to publication.
Marlow’s headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
This Morning is one of Britain’s most reliable stars, and experts say its source could cause millions of losses to the company due to product investments, including everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household goods, not to mention delays in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truey in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones took over as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be baked as the new M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said on the previous bridge, "we did not comment on his business."
Tight talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism that would be received in the media about what some would consider inappropriate for the president, as well as his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said while pretending to be a "news anchor" voice.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He noted Kim’s interest in reuniting after Trump slammed the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
The nuclear negotiations, however, have said so.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a “similar reaction” from the United States to North Korea’s early hostilities.
Instead, he said the United States would continue its sanctions, which are aimed at keeping the pressure high.
In his speech, Trump had a much more optimistic view.
"North Korea is doing very well," he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have such an excellent relationship.”
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been freed and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more out of this crowded hall, we’d have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and quake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national state of emergency required for international assistance was not declared, although about 10 per cent of Lombok residents had been homeless.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is a group that travels back, it is not clear whether foreign staff can work in the field.
A spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations were allowed to participate in aid work.
Indonesia remains unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account the regular earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The call was likely lost due to a tsunami warning siren that was missing, even though the warning was in place.
Traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way back to the island, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident zone.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s past infrastructure development a focal point in his election campaign, and he has spent money on improving roads and railways.
However, some governments have been plagued by a financial deficit, while new elections are approaching next year.
The tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted the more ancient form of religion, are also heightened.
Christians and Muslim men have fought in the streets with jungle swords, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands of others who have had to leave their homes.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sinks late match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's loss in the league on Saturday after scoring 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got an inning from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's goal when his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before hovering towards the back of the shot.
The shooting was high across the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
In the end, the ball dropped over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"As I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch, and I would unthinkingly trigger excesses."
Chelsea led the match in the halftime 1–0 with Belgian Eden Hazard scoring in the 25th minute.
The Blues basket gave a lead to Mateo Kovacic in the situation before scoring a run near the midfield and sprinting for Liverpool's midfielder.
Kovacic played a fast wall-feeding midfield.
Then he released Hazard to the penal zone with a sleight of hand.
Hazard escaped from the defence and passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker's left foot in the back corner.
Liverpool will meet in the Champions League block stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The Indonesian disaster agency said on Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Sutopo Purwo, the agency’s spokesperson, told a news conference that many had fallen into the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves as high as six meters.
The fragments of the Roman buildings spread widely to the city of Palu with 380,000 inhabitants.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Finding Wooden Woman Dead
A woman's body found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning started a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested for the murder.
The police will ask people in the area to sign up if they have seen or heard anything.
Criminal commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to all those in Birkenhead near John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman who was found dead was from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, there have come to the scene of the crime possibly familiar persons of the woman, who have asked about her location.
As the investigation continues, the police say they are trying to inform the victim's relatives of the incident.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had said no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it can take hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
There was a tearful woman at the scene.
He repeated, "It's terrible."
In the area isolated at two in the afternoon, there were two dairy cows, and outside there was a third.
In the isolated area, there were several police officers guarding the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something will be asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or call the anonymous Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using the code 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell patch also became part of history's rewrite suit
The wedding of the statue would be a fairy tale, given that its own fanatical puritanists destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best of the Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "typical" and "to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate about removing the statues would make a painting of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not command or implement the iconoclasm of the English Civil War.
The wrong Cromwell may have suffered from the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent description of Cromwell reflects the opinions of the 19th century and is historical evidence of a character that many still consider to be worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, although perhaps more in the 19th century than today, regard Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against the external pressures, which in this case, of course, were caused by the monarchy.
Is the exact description of the subject, then, the subject of an ongoing historical debate?
It is certain, at least, that the controversy of the mid-18th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell must, in turn, be identified with a character that represents the other side of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a public servant deserve praise and recollection.”
A Chinese farmer's life was shattered.
Local media say the pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to the report.
The body of a man identified only by his surname "Yuan" was found near a pig on Liupanshui Square in Guizhou province. The man's artery had broken and he was upside down in blood, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
The pig shepherd prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunna province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door of a nearby pig was open.
In the pig he said he had seen a big bear whose mouth was in blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed the 250-pound bee crushed by the farmer's life.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and swollen".
The surveillance camera shows the cousin coming to the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the square told the Evening News that the pig had been stuffed behind locks so as not to harm others when police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked humans in the past, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, where he suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig slammed a Welsh farmer against this tractor until his wife managed to smother the animal.
After the incident, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
You just have to respect them properly,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants bring heavy rains to the southern United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s north coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding routes to northern Mexico and the southern parts of the United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, or a first-class hurricane, on Sunday at 5 a.m. on the east coast, and it was located 620 kilometers south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa arrives on the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical humidity northwards towards the U.S. luncheon, and the Pacific Ocean begins to form a low pressure to the east towards the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form large areas of rain in the coming days to the southwest.
Locally, 25-100 millimeters of rainfall cause dangerous heavy rainfall and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 millimeters of rainfall per hour in certain rainfall zones, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
In certain areas in the south, and especially in Arizona, up to 50-100 millimeters of rain is expected.
Heavy rainfall is possible and conditions can weaken rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In case of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms cause local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure zone brings local heavy rains to the coastlines of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 10 millimeters is possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
Fragmented tropical rainstorms begin approaching Arizona on late Sundays and early Mondays, until the rains expand during Mondays and Tuesdays.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesdays and last all Wednesday.
In October, the United States can see intense fluctuations in temperatures as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
In the middle part of the United States, there is an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines.
The heat of the summer is intensifying and expanding again in the coming days.
From the beginning of October, it is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures feeling <0x2B>26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature can hurt to <0x2B>26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a good chance of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
More than 20 million people watched six television broadcasts on Tuesday, in which Supreme Court referee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sex crimes in the 1980s, gave their fascinating witness statements.
At the same time, the political turmoil continued when television companies suspended their broadcasts with a last-minute reversal that the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation into allegations based on an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that the drunken Kavanaugh punched him and tried to strip off his clothes in high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional witness statement saying that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the occasion, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring the viewers who are watching in the offices.
Some of the dimensions indicate that the reading corresponds to the number of spectators in the American football drop play or the Oscar industry.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers of all television companies was on Fox News Channel, which opinion leaders have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day of the hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, the interest was still high.
In the middle of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras described how the protesters' screams led him to the elevator on his way to a hearing of the Justice Committee on Friday, which the Republican moderate's background had previously announced he was voting for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed straight how he stood at the minute shop looking down at the bells flying.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the people?
“You have power when so many women are powerless,” he was told.
Flake said his office had given an opinion and added before the closure of the elevators that he had more to say after the committee's hearing.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks broadcast live as the Committee on Justice began to vote on bringing Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he only worked on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake, in part, convinced his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, based on his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit politicization
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her EU plans of politicising that threatens Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In addition to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for a proposal that Britain and the EU would "acquire each other's import duties."
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball at the LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and handed over to prison, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, and is charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's mediation, in which the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB.
Police say Simpson admitted to the shooting of Wayde in interrogations.
According to Lawyer magazine, he was paid $350,000 for his bail.
East Baton Rouge County Death Investigator published a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Strike Team, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the residents of the area for assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement authorities for their "news and law enforcement".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 disc balls in a game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was "horrified" and "dismayed" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this happening," Wayde said.
Volcano splashes ash over Mexico City
The ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico’s Center for Disaster Prevention urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater accelerated and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded during the day.
The center records the squirrel and vibrate several times.
Images were posted on social media that covered a thin layer of ash in residential areas like Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southwest of the capital after Mexico shook the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan paratroopers gather before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in a clash between protesters and riot police, with thousands taking part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote to share their opinions.
The police detained a group of masked independence supporters who threw the police with eggs and powder paint, which formed dark clouds of dust on the normally tourist-filled streets.
Over the course of the day, more swarms broke out as police used their pumpkins to restrain squirrels.
Meetings between supporters of independence and Unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and the latter "let Spain live".
The local press reports that fourteen people have been treated for the minor injuries suffered during the demonstrations.
Tensions are still on the surface in the independence-friendly region a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but is being celebrated by Catalan paratists.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although participation was low in the boycotted vote of opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
On Friday, independence groups stayed outside in order to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to go a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.”
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he says.
Despite the precise but vital victory achieved in the regional elections last December, the pace of Catalonia’s independence-supporting parties has skyrocketed this year. Many of the most well-known leaders have been detained in voluntary expulsion or forced into self-defense and awaiting trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who shot a police demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides of the litigation scene are arguing.
“The situation is getting worse all the time,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody until last year, announced that he will participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
"To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the degradation and repression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashed into house
The 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Criminal commissioner Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car was shot with a shoulder strap.
Livingston won the Rangers 1-0 with Mengan
Dolly Mengan's first goal at Livingston was a win.
Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Mengan's goal was finally enough to win Gary Holt's team as they moved up to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team missed the first guest win of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday it will meet with series director Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
The Rangers will play in the Rapid Vienna Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, went on to score six games in a row without losing a single time after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Lost Places for Visitor Suffering from Missing a Knife
Holt's team should have been leading long before their goal after causing the Rangers bad trouble with their straightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, followed by Alan Lithgow sliding onto Craig Halkett's brush feed, but directed the ball past.
The hosts popularly handed over the ball management to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate in special situations.
This is how an important painting came about.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga, from which he managed to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found that the home team was holding the defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not able to try very much.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow led the ball past one more Livingston special case.
Concentrations rained on Livingston's penalty area were continuously cleared. In addition, from two situations, a penalty kick was demanded in vain - from Halkett's tampered interchanger Glenn Middleton and from the ball hit in the hand.
"Excellent performance from Livingston - analysis
the BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent with each player, continuing through the ascent leads.
The team’s playing style and crew have hardly changed as it returns to the highest level of the series. However, Holt has to be recognized for the way he has strengthened the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing in leading the perfectly organized defense, with Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers had no idea.
The team has occasionally performed really well under Gerrard, but has now remained far from his level of requirement.
The last feed was exhausted, and they managed to open the home team's defense only once. This should serve as an awakening for the Rangers, which is the middle box of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has a different reception in Cologne.
The smile was delicate and sky blue on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of which is to correct relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements on human rights and freedom of the press as well as on Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan went on his trip to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police prevented a crowd of 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, cancelling the matter for security reasons, but a lot of supporters gathered nearby to look at the president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some of the German Turks hail him as a hero when others insult him as a sovereign.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died when he crashed into a car in London.
The accident occurred around ten o'clock in the morning at Deptford's lunch area near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street with bustling traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and the care staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a car accident on Childers Street, about one and a half miles from Saturday’s crash site.
The city police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There are road closures on site and bus services have been diverted to other places and drivers have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Disturbances
Prison officials say six prison guards were injured in the high-security men's riots at the prison.
The riots began at HMP Long Lart Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, and continue.
Tornado special police have been brought to the scene to appease the riots, with eight prisoners in one prison cell.
The police's minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesperson said: “A specially trained prison staff has been sent to HMP Long Lartin to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into custody by the police and they may have to spend longer behind bars.”
The HMP Long Lart prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
The head of the prison was reported to have received hospital treatment in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, riot police were alerted to prisons in October due to serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa poses a threat of heavy rainfall to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s happening at the beginning of next week, when Hurricane Rosa’s remnants move across the southern desert with the risk of heavy rainfall.
The National Weather Service has already warned of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as to the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over the Phoenix on Tuesday. It will arrive on Monday in the form of rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted that "only ten of the tropical storms have preserved a tropical storm or low-pressure state at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 65 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50-100 millimeters of rainfall. The Mogollin brush in Arizona can occasionally rain up to 150 millimeters.
In other areas of the southern desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters are produced in verifiable quantities, with a total of up to 100 millimeters of rainfall.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing to experience drought in the area if there is no risk of heavy rainfall.
While floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains may be beneficial because of severe droughts in the south.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa makes its first landing on the peninsula of California in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa’s location is 620 kilometers south of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia. It is still the hurricane’s strong wind speed at 135 kilometers per hour. It moves north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon or during the evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall can be severe and pose a significant flood risk.
“From the California peninsula to the northwestern Sonora, 75-150 millimeters are expected, and up to 250 millimeters are possible,” says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning, from there she will continue her journey through Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday..
“The greatest risk of rose or its remains is due to very severe rains on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora, and the southern desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Agency said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning, British time.
He was taken to a hospital, where he is said to be in a "stable" condition.
Police say they arrested a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police will contact anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on their mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Experienced Democratic Party's "Righteousness and Anger"
“My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and shameful methods,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the Democratic Party's "disgust and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual harassment that had occurred decades ago in their teens.
Ford also testified about his accusations in the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans have seen Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" on that day.
“My vote in favor of confirming the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most deserving legal scholars of our time, who has excellent seafarers for public service,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when speaking about the importance of Republican voting activity in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lives.
Not just campaigning, but campaigning in full,” he said.
"That's why I'm reciprocating everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats had taken on the task of “resisting and preventing.”
A senior assistant to the Republican Party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh’s nomination process is expected to be held by the Senate no later than Friday.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami kills hundreds, death toll is expected to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed in a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, with many wiped out along with the huge waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Pula on Friday, when waves as high as six meters hit the beach in the evening darkness, many drowned in their deaths by destroying the waves all their way.
The tsunami caused an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
When the threat of the tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach, and did not immediately flee, so they fell victim to it,” said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it carried cars, wooden frames, houses and hit the entire country," Nugroho says. He adds that the tsunami reached an open sea speed of 800 kilometers an hour before it hit the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial images published by the Office of Disasters show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to haunt the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s technology assessment and application agency BPPT said the energy released in a massive earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have blown up a tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "widespread" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could be greater than 300 kilometers north of Palu on the continuous coast, in the Donggala area, which is closer to the center of the quake.
Communications "are completely out of control, and no information has been received from Dongga," Nugroho said.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report the tsunami on its return, but authorities said the waves had arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building is screaming out loud warnings to people on the street about tsunami.
Only minutes later the beach is hit by a water wall that takes you to go buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large power outage that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say the army has started sending help from Jakarta and other cities by transporting planes, but evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city’s airport has been reopened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
The staff of World Vision Donggala have entered the city of Palu, where they have been housed in tent cloth coverings in the yard of the office. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
It's really bad.
When the aid groups began their uncomfortable mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin to flow once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can begin to receive international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the second night landed on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family members of the missing were cheering for the hope that by the trade of a miracle their loved ones would deviate from the gloomy story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was picked up.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in the ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian addict team coach, had trained two missing addicts for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi says.
“As a senior member of the wing, I have my own emotional duty,” he says.
Gendon says it has desperately tried to reach out to the contestants at the beach festival via WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the affiliate community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey character appeared instead of two blue ones.
"It means that I understand that messages were not received," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 from ATM supplement in connection with Newport on the Wide
The thieves took $26,750 from an employee of the Brink's security movement on Friday morning as this was supplementing the ATM at Newport on the Wide, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car had been emptying and supplementing the ATM located in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "he's guaranteed to run the man," who stole the money for delivery.
According to the information, eyewitnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identities are requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Raptor Changes His Name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday, he said: “The character who was previously known as Kanye West.”
Ye has been a favorite name for 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who, according to the show's creator, cancelled her participation for "dark reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has a religious meaning for him, in addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name.
Discussing the album's name earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "believes that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
"It's you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means singular, and ended up in a shorter form of Ye - which only expresses the goodness, the evil, the confusion, all of it.
The album is mostly a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several known rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs is known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his favorite names Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner, JAY-Z, has also removed and restored the connecting line and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the student retaliation.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that he would “never use an army to oppress the Mexican people.”
The armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by offering monthly study grants and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into crime scenes.
Interconnections should double the funding for artificial intelligence research
The U.S. should double the funding it uses to research artificial intelligence as China streamlines its operations in the industry, said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by notifications of various parts of the U.S. administration on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start given that there are so many other countries behind the United States and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee says.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next significant artificial intelligence gain would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book “The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Board of Trustees, working as CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most important artificial intelligence<0x2B> firms.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that outperformed the U.S. top-ranked Othello player, and later served as chief executive officer of Microsoft Research and Google's China operations.
Lee gave recognition to the U.S. administration’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers have worked hard to get public funding.
“Academic influencers don’t take China, they take big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to intensify its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think that those with a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence should automatically be awarded green cards," he said.
The Government of China plans for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other state organizations grant money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is poorer in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Defense Department Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industry and academic partners, and the White House has announced the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Special Committee.
This month, DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF, in turn, invests more than $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in a referendum on changing the country's name
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to "the Republic of North Macedonia." The name change would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has hampered the country's aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
In the opinion of Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, the name of the North Neighbourhood is practically a territorial requirement of its territory and has therefore objected to its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents believe the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he is not going to vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts about whether voting activity will reach the required 50% limit in order for the result to be legal.
The question in the ballot box was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of a name change such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, after the collapse of Yugoslavia, can aspire to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
While the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the result of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Electoral Commission, no irregularities were reported by 1 p.m.
However, voting activity was only 16, compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, with 66 per cent of the eligible voters voting in the end.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a referendum on the Macedonian name change in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would pave the way for NATO and EU membership .
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents erected by a referendum boycotting the Skopje parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join heads up and not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to something else, like China and Russia, as part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership is bringing the needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of the name change, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said the "yes" voice was "feel our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday indicated 30-43% of the voter turnout in a referendum - i.e. less than the required activity.
In a second poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they voted in favour of the “yes” option.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western government since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats Brighton's defense with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear trail of Brighton's defense at Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In 65 minutes, Aguero made his goal look ridiculously easy.
At the start of the draw, the Argentine top player got an inning from the midfield.
He found an empty space on the field by sprinting through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed that he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to his left.
The English top used his first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-angled shot.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with her legs".
“We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Luckily, he did the job at the time.”
However, Sterling had already given the Blues an advantage in the election campaign.
The goal came with 29 games.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy San a beautiful pencil on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before he sent the ball back to the back of Sterling.
The sky blue attacker smashed the ball into the net just before the end of the line.
City will face the Hoffenheim Champions League in the block stage Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in the game against Rockies
The Nationals are out of dropping games, so why push for a starting lineup?
However, as competitive as Scherzer, he hopes to take the lead in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a downside, with a one-off victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western series.
The Rockies caught at least a wild card with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
“Although we don’t have any stakes, we can at least get on the board knowing that the atmosphere of the public and the other team here in Denver creates for me the most demanding competition I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take on the challenge?”
The Nationals have not yet published their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance in these circumstances.
On Thursday, Scherzer threw a workout, playing 34 at the start of his game and eating on Sunday with his normal resting time.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. ERA stats are 2.53 and he has burned the striker's net 300 times, with a turn par stats of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican voting activity in the midterm elections.
“All of our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the really great ones -- not just campaigning, but campaigning fully, and that's why I'm running everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to power by any means, and you can see their atrocities and their wickedness.
They don't choose who will hurt or who will have to grind in order to gain power; they want it, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats had taken on the task of "resisting and preventing".
“And it has been visible in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and evil and evil and lying.”
Referring to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-affected Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the public responded with a loud outcry.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leave the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, uh, no, I'm waiting for a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion
I was not really surprised when my local party Momentum activists supported the distrust clause against me.
I'm at least the last in a row to be the last Labour representative to be told that I'm not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the distrust clause was a criticism of my disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, there are similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years that I have been a local Labour representative, the Friday size of the party council, have been just that.
Now many of the meeting does not follow that tone of voice, and the "more friendly and gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is all the more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates differing opinions, and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is appropriate for the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I thought I would share a similar political view began to expect me to be fully translated and to take positions that I would never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a riot on social media, which calls for the revocation of my choice, the rejection of centralist politics, and I hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I know that I am indeed more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments are political in nature at least.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily sexist and racist harassment, and never fail.
The normalization of ill-treatment is one of the most disturbing aspects of politics of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to embrace a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every distrust clause or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
For two years I have been asked to keep my profile low and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything goes well".
But that’s not why I went to politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, as a result of the failure of the Thatcher government's unified school, I have sought to promote better public services to those who need them most, both as a city councillor and as a minister.
I have never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency has been surprised by my views or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a detrimental Brexit on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honour, and the threat of secession or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr in the block basket
The last two goals were a bit confusing about the end of the match, but Ayr undoubtedly won the day’s fun Tennent <0xCC><0x81>s Premiership.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who have not lost a single game.
A great defense and more successful risk-taking was, after all, what cost them, and coach Peter Murchie can be happy for a reason.
"We've been challenged in our games and we're still unbeaten, so I can be happy," he says.
Melrose Robyn Christie says, "Honor Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who gave up the Warriors, enabled Melrose to climb, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's lead on penalty paint, and just before half time he scored and succeeded in the conversion kick, raising Ayr's lead to readings of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second batch very well with Patrick Anderson's goal, whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr grew his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo succeeded in a conversion knockout.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal, whose conversion kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored the goal from the side throw following Ayr's moustache.
Climo managed the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and beat Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
The Star of the Still Game Series Begins in the Restaurant Industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, has been named the director of the licensed restaurant company and is thus also starting to work in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kierna is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is listed as the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment on the information, but a source in the Scottish Sun magazine suggested that Kierna wanted to join Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": the inland state of Bolivia tries to regain contact with the Pacific Ocean by means of justice
The sailors set sail outside the naval base in La Paz.
There is a blue flag on the flag bars of public buildings.
The bases of the navy from Titicaca to the Amazon have been shaken with a slogan: "Justly the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to get it back.”
Inland Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s lost coastline during the bloody 19th century resource war is still strong – as is the desire to sail in the Pacific Ocean once again.
The hope is at its highest for decades as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice’s decision on October 1st after five years of reflection.
“Bolivia has a strong commitment to progress, a common spirit and a steadfastness, and of course a positive attitude in anticipation of a final solution,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Several Bolivians across the country are following the International Court of Justice’s decision on a large scale, hoping that the position of Bolivia on the obligation to grant independent access to the sea in Bolivia will be defended in The Hague – at the end of a decades-long debate.
Bolivia’s charismatic president Evo Morales, who faces a contested re-election next year, will have a lot to play in the lineup next Monday.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he assured at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change very much.
The Dutch-based UN institution does not have the competence to surrender Chilean territories, and the ICJ has stated that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision is given only six months after the latest statements indicate that the case “is not complicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the last four years have rather been slowing down than promoting Bolivia's intentions.
"The current Bolivian government has hijacked the issue of maritime connectivity," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’s controversial rhetoric has suppressed the rest of Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile are continuing the talks at some point, but it is very difficult to organise the negotiations afterwards.
There has not been a second embassy in either country since 1962.
The former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court’s decision would have been exceptionally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given "an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to end the 139-year-old disputes for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, had used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to contact the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time to move on from the past.”
North Korea says no nuclear disarmament will take place unless it can rely on the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore Summit of Heads of State.
Rin’s stance came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is resuming nuclear diplomacy, just three months after the U.S. met with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was “a distant dream” to believe that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is on the cusp of adopting the Declaration.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up its arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has received widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The fashion shows in Paris will feature the newest large-sized headgear from the latest collection, which will soon also be on your street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don’t need to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled at their SS19 show a selection of special over-sized headwear that dazzled the fashion week in Paris.
Very impractical headlines dominated Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows as well.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feather lining that covered the heads of the models almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included ornamental watermelon, witch hat and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a range of different models of masks – just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than fashionable.
One creature with a snorkel and mask was more like a diving tool, and the other looked like a melted ice cream jar.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you're in luck.
Followers of fashion predict that huge scarves are appearing in the street scene.
The cut-sized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a half-meter-lined shoulder hat that has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult material of the impractical hat, which has been widely seen on social media, also imbued with the fashion shows of a second-size creation – a beach bag made of oil that is almost the same size as the model that wears it.
The orange ribbed raffle bag with white leather hand straps was the most eye-catching creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Weeks.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags in the street next summer – the designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistics is a key skill for a global citizen
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been reinforced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These over 30,000 pupil schools located across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools SCIS, strive to provide high-quality service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their chosen careers, graduate and higher education, as well as for world citizenship.
As a player in the education sector who can design and implement customized learning content, we have noticed the status of languages as a preferred and desired learning material in continuing education institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in their own language, the message goes to their heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships with people in other countries.
From this year’s most recent test results, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of access percentage among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest A rating.
Based on the data collected from 74 SCIS schools, 72% of the pupils who received the best grade A studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment Agency in 2014, 17% of situations where an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the promotion of future career development for young people.
The more possible jobs require language skills, the more essential these skills will be in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, regardless of which career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner puts a language-savvy person automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, 75% of over 4,000 adults in the UK are unable to engage in conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language with a double-digit figure of 15%.
For this reason, investing in language learning is now important for today’s children.
In particular, the ability to speak the languages of developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposed to be important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, there are always several language options in private schools taught by specialized teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied at this time that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Today’s languages should indeed be seen as ‘international communication skills’.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, versatility and a high level of Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the SCIS Board of Scottish Private Schools
LeBron to make his debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for LeBron James to make his first appearance at the Los Angeles Lakes is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays, remains to be seen.
“It’s going to be more than one, and less than 48,” he said on the official website of the Walton Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play in the upcoming minutes.
James, who followed the drills, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six-game playoffs.
“At this point, I don’t need any more pre-matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump's campaign time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five election campaigns planned for the next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and the Mississippi.
While awaiting the vote for his election to fill the vacant seat of the Supreme Court judge, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event will begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign event online as a live stream via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is taking a stand at this week’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing, which came to light on accusations of sexual harassment that have delayed the Senate’s confirmation vote as early as this week’s FBI investigation into allegations.
But the primary objective of the campaign series is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November elections.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign commented on these next week’s five events is intended to “wake up volunteer and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Government of Congress is so important to his purpose that the president is ready to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesperson told Reuters.
Today’s venue is the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and there can be supporters from even “Ohio and Pennsylvania,” as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Will to Keep Hope Up Before Sunday's Singles
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday afternoon quarterfinals were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-reinforcing force of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where do you think this power of success is at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we take this success as a hippie," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points ahead and 12 points to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in the sails and a lot to be encouraged by, such as the fitness of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play all day together and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been powerful from brick to brick, and leads by example.
The sluggish throat sounds of the winning party intensified as he progressed to a critical hole to level the match to level four, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The pit in which they won the 15th match was followed by a similar cry, which gave the impression that he believes the U.S. team has not yet lost.
“You have to focus really well and just take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed Ryder Cup legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special but delightful double has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only duo to do no bogies on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bogits on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
That round, and the way they give and receive energy from this cheerleading audience, confirms that they are Sunday’s favourites. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no other more popular player to ensure a possible European win than Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather both at the same time with different holes.
The talk of Europe's success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly collided with Alex Noren, Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning four.
One bogie and two double bogies in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede so deep that they were not even close to surviving from there.
But on Sunday, no one will come to help you out of the hut.
Four ball and four game are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of couples’ collaboration: what kind of advice they give or leave out, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a significant lead before the last day, but this quarter-final showed that the United States team has a will to fight, even though it is suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe to take 10-6 lead before Ryder Cup final day
Europe is well ahead of the Ryder Cup's final day after they took the lead in Saturday's four-ball and four-game 10-6 from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning run with two wins from the smashing Tiger Woods, scoring a high of four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European side, who worked hard to keep his win at Hazeltine two years ago, was weakly controlling the U.S. team's play in the morning's quarter-ball with a 3-1 lead.
The U.S. was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Fury's side needed eight points out of Sunday's 12 doubles games to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also known as "Molliwood", were the second double in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend.
After scoring first in the quarter-ball with Woods and Patrick Reed, they then finished with an even tougher 5–4 victory over Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who barely made it through two games on Saturday, was occasionally very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-game, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four balls, but returned with Henrik Stenson in the four-game, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are in the rankings first and third.
Europe did not get everything the way it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to the south.
Triple value winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the U.S. by two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2–1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals, and later a 4–3 victory over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the quarterfinals after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team has risen from a four-point behind-the-scenes level at the start of the doubles, although on Furyk's side, a tie is also enough to keep the win.
However, after two days for the second, the best thing to do may be that Sunday’s counter-attack is too much to ask for.
North Korea 'in no way' strips itself of its weapons without confidence
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's foreign minister told the U.N. on Saturday that continuing sanctions had only heightened confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolent measures" over the past year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, detonating the nuclear test site and promising that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so under such circumstances, it is not possible to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
While Mr Ri reiterated the fact that Washington does not accept a phased nuclear ceasefire, which would reward North Korea for every intermediate issue, his statement is nevertheless significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament has not been completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first sitting US President-North Korean leader summit in Singapore on June 12, in a statement Kim assured "the Korean peninsula will be stripped of nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950–1953 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang surrender its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed the easing of stringent international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States has called for ‘nuclear disarmament first,’ and has raised pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by means of violence – even opposing the ‘peace declaration’,” Ri said.
"The conviction that sanctions would get us on our knees is the wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are only deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans to host the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea and not the United States were the party demanding disarmament, the situation would not have progressed to such an impasse."
Yet Rin’s tone of voice was significantly different from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that pointing missiles toward the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “bad President” Trump called Kim “suicidal” missiles.
Still last year, Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. However, this year, Trump praised Kim for his courage to approach a ceasefire, but still stressed that there is still much work to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia proposed that the UN Security Council should be rewarded for the progress made in Pyongyang.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and without failure until we witness a complete, definitive and confirmed waiver of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimouslyintensified sanctions against North Korea with a view to halting Pyongyang’s funding channels for ballistic and nuclear missile production.
Pompeo met at the UN General Assembly in Rin, North Korea, and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterial demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea pledged to close the missile launch site and nuclear plant in a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes “similar measures”.
According to Pompeo, Kim means “similar measures” of security pledged by Trump at the Singapore meeting and a shift towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course that instructs them to a sufficient rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University are taking part in this year’s course designed to increase student rest. The course is a countermeasure to the university’s thriving macho culture, where students weigh a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant about basic issues related to their own well-being.
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard University, who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, believes the course will be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course by reading about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, I spoke to a young woman who said, ‘Why do I not hear about it until now, in my last year of college?’
“No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I found surprising,” he told the Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right sleep habits support academic and athletic performance as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of medicine at Harvard University and vice president of health services at the University, said the university had completed a course after hearing students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week of study.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will be presented with a picture of the living room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, equipped with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this does not have an immediate impact on student behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these things just as they have the right to know about the health effects caused by smoking,” Professor Czeisler adds.
All-night student marathons are still the subject of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and current technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
“Getting enough and high-quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state similar to starvation in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry,” the professor notes.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and gave the impetus to organise a course that encompasses all the students on the campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students could complete a similar set of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock to remind them of sleep time in addition to waking up in the morning, and encourages them to keep in mind the side effects of electronic displays and LED "blue light" on daily rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: With no shot you will win from Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day as Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 win.
Ibrox players were looking for their first win since February 4–1, which was played against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the win this time, and Gerrard now only experienced his second loss in his 18-game manager career. The Rangers were left out of this eight-point lead.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers' fallen pace of battle no longer leveled the situation after that.
As a result of the game, the Rangers dropped to sixth place. Livingston has instead climbed to third place, and the goal difference is higher only for Hibernia.
The Rangers may also have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when the object thrown from a guest view hit the head, and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the composition in which the team had beaten Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 setup, which brought the team a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy produced a result again when a well-constructed setup managed to discipline the opponent in almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better at using the situations to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score in two minutes, when Menga's first inning gave Scott Pittman a free kick for Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender Alan Lithgow only managed to blow wide into the back.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the last third of the game there was no confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily resisted Lassana Coulibaly's punch and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston’s goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation wasn’t just due to the hard work of the team.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long feeding tactics.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coldly brought the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
In exchange, Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable hole for Morelos. However, the attack interrupted Kelly's impact on the fast defense.
Livingston allowed visitors to play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long feeds one after the other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow managed to reach the corner.
Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty kick after joining Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geiger meter inventor
Next page "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter is also a key concept of pop culture. For example, the film "Coronado watches", which appeared in 1950, is well suited to presenting scientists who are quite impressive as herdsmen:
Man: "What kind of miracle is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigerometer. It's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put the headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really rattising now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, an invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Able to Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Harmful Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Able to Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Harmful Cells and Destroy Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and changed in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the typical proteins for many people who eat
The vaccine has given promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
For example, a patient with ovarian cancer lost cancer cells within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In this method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see' the typical HER2 proteins for many people who eat, and the modified cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: “Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "steers the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancer."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West hit the teeth of critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The project did not go according to plan.
Kanye West has been hit with the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after praising President Donald Trump in a blatant manner and announcing he is running for president in the 2020 election.
Following the presentation of his third song, “Ghost Town,” Trump’s campaign cap “Make America Great Again,” West attacked Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“When I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
“If racism were a problem, I would have changed America a long time ago,” he said.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch of Matt Damon's departure from Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's baking was not shown live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intends to mock the West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been treated unfairly in the background because of the hat he had on his head.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told not to go on stage with this hat on my head.
I've been harassed!
Then they'll say I'm on the margins," West said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see what it means to be on the margins?” and says he’s wearing the Steelman reference because “then you can’t dictate what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
West's comments, according to Variety, ripped off the audience at least twice, and the show's performers seemed embarrassed. One of those present described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West was selected to join the program on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by presenting the song "I Love It" dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who praised this bravery on Twitter: "LET'S CALL WHEN THE MEN WANT TO CHOOSE."
Karen Hunter, the talk show’s host, tweeted that West “is just herself, which is once in a while absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I can decide whether I want to support a person (by buying this music or branding or supporting this ‘art’) who I consider to support and disseminate an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us,” he added.
The rapper announced before his appearance on Twitter that he had changed his name to “the person previously known as Kanye West.”
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as the Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later became an artist known before as Prince.

Game of Thrones Actress Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging heroic role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent fantasy series Throne Game.
However, Harrington has attacked the macho hero's stereotype: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural magazine, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” in the matter, and questions the means available to address toxic masculinity in the era of the <0x23>MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, also on the Stars of the Game of Thrones, also married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, Harrington admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we've gone wrong with masculinity arouses strong feelings in me right now," he says.
“What have men been taught about their growth over the years, which has led to the problems that are now noticeable?”
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues, “What is inborn and what is learned?
What do we learn on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel they need to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
“Young people have something really bad going on.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not take part in the production of the pre- or follow-up parts of the Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to himself, "enough of the battlefields and the horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells of the filmmaker and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife, Rose, was the best Game of Thrones has offered him.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on,” she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow in Harrington's Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were celebrated in June 2018 on the estates of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections in China has increased 14%
China has reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the conference in Yunnan province, the number of HIV infections in this way has been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and infected with AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sex-related HIV infections are an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to ensure the universal availability of HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee's leaked Republican senator's information and accuses him of spreading "dangerous lies" and "secret alliance theories"
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday contested allegations that her employee had published personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia page.
A Los Angeles-based Democratic representative said the proponents of the allegations were "extreme-right" commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
Among the information released were the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham representing South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orr Hatch representing Utah State.
An unidentified person released the information on Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a Senate Committee hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that, according to the Hillin newspaper, messages were published from the IP address attached to the Waters office and from a member of the Waters staff.
“This unjustified accusation is absolutely false and it is an absolute lie,” Water said.
“My employee, whose identities, personal data and security have been compromised by these false and false accusations, is not responsible for any form of leakage of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and absolutely a lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and critics included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
"It seems that his character does not suit a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he or she has not done, he or she has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be shy.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
In this situation, you have to behave modestly and calmly.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters in the midterm elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"I can't believe this is true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that it had contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies on the basis of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they are brought to legal responsibility for all destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff members.”
Johnny English hits again – inefficient agent parody of Rowan Atkinson
There is already a well-established tradition of looking for Brexit references from any film that is about Britain, but this doesn’t seem to fit the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English’s “resurrection” and revived the English of 2011.
Can the language of a nation’s satire become Britain’s new national export success?
In one way or another, the blunt-eyed, cumbersome and incompetent Johnny English has already earned his permission to rehearse. Already his name tells us above all that it is a comedy creation that is aimed at the non-English-speaking film market.
It is, of course, a stupid secret agent who desperately tries to breathe the glamour that lurks around him, but appears mixed up with Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the unfortunate one-minute musician at the opening concert in London in 2012.
The character has been left behind by a cosmopolitan and a mystical world man who Atkinson originally portrayed in Barclaycard’s now-forgotten TV commercials.
The last show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives by helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the stages of the rotor swirl his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts come out, but humor itself seems inefficient and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ movie brands such as 007 and The Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems oriented to children, and Johnny English’s crazy treatment doesn’t seem as ingenious and sharp-looking to me as Atkinson’s Mr. Bean’s comedy.
A recurring point of departure each year is that the UK is in worse trouble once.
The cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents on the field to the shock of an agent in service – portrayed as Kevin Eldon’s unfortunate minor role.
This is the last drop for the important and incumbent prime minister, who is already ready with her ears on the side of political inconvenience: Emma Thompson does everything in the skins of Teresa May’s parody character, but the script just doesn’t provide her enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies on the ground have been revealed, it is necessary to invite someone who has already moved away from the active service.
Of course, this is Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a high school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble arts of espionage. The subject evokes some clever jokes; English holds school-of-rock types of lessons.
English is applauded for an emergency meeting at Whitehall, where he meets again with his endlessly patient fighting partner Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to her rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to her Majesty's secret service to meet the fateful supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire.Jake Lacy’s actor Jason Volta claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough turns into a farce at the same time: a pair of masked waiters set fire to a fine French restaurant and stir up chaos in the quest for Volta’s luxury hunt. The attempt to get acquainted with Volta’s house with virtual glasses ends in a pure mass of anarchy.
Even the last hindrances of the actors will come to an end, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a bit made for the children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When I look at Johnny English movies, I’ve come to the same conclusion: Why can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but pay the wages for five days.
The party is told that corporate leaders are demanding that the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution be transferred to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends at the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of the ‘opis’ of the party’s economic programme and its plans to bolster the policies for the benefit of the workers.
The Central Association of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means by which workers can benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “I was informed of the line’s review before the turn of the year.
The change does not happen in an instant, but the four-day working week is an objective that is consistent with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers and the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: Britain’s Green Party has pledged to support the transition to a four-day working week in its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive undivided support in the lines of Labour.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day work week is not the party’s lineup, and the party is not considering such a move.”
The shadow government’s finance minister, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s working conference to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless dictators” and “spionage” of companies of general interest.
According to the plans of the shadow government finance minister, the current shareholders of water companies would not get their full share back, because the Labour-led government could implement "reductions" based on the observed abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to the management of employees. According to the plan, an individual employee would be paid a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into the charges against FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could be detrimental to some Republican senators.
In Sunday’s 60 Minutes episode, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it would be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a rock.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett disputed it sharply," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he appointed were able to confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old issue.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held in New York on Saturday, is a music event whose performance card is as impressive as its mission: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now held for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to New York City’s Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by the age of 30.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eradicate poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience must perform a variety of tasks or "works", such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision maker or calling, or performing any other work that disseminates awareness of the project's goals.
But how has Global Citizen been successful now that there is only 12 years left to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a real way to get people to take action, or is it just one ‘clickivism’ among others – the idea that you can change the world by signing a web address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reported that it has recorded more than 19 million “deeds” for various purposes since 2011.
These actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion that have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already contributed to the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
The most important commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the UK, which is committed to “helping the development of children to their full potential”. The group committed to delivering 4 million dollars of assets to Rwanda after the end of the campaign.
“Thanks to the UK government, donors, governments of different countries and world citizens like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the newspapers,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the public at a 2018 London concert.
The group also called on the UK government to take action to improve nutrition for mothers and children with more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the movement’s website is, “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen’s response: “The road is going to be long and difficult and there are many stumbling blocks ahead.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and the anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, because together we are stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host a New York concert this year, featuring artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says the country could make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as an “impediment”
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner, said Washington could "if necessary" resort to the help of its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy into the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s activities in Syria – at the invitation of a legitimate government – are an excuse for the recognition of new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason for [Russia’s] presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern hemisphere of Europe," Zinken said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open by means of its fleet and, if necessary, by issuance, to ensure that the energy they provide does not reach the world market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the public about an event organized by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that is profiling as a "energy consumer voice tower" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that this is one and the same issue.
"The economic option between Iran and Russia is more or less speculative, and replacing fuel with another," he says, describing Russia as a "one-trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements date back to a situation where the Trump administration has sought to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
In order to make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says binds Berlin to the recovery line in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the 110 billion cubic metres of transmission capacity of the existing pipeline, as a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington’s opposition, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perryn in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has provoked a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industry umbrella organisation, the German Central Industrial Association, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country interferes with our energy supply," German Industrial Union chief Dieter Kempf said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, intends to carefully consider "applying for the 2020 presidential election"
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she is “carefully considering” running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering running an open poll in Holly, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our faulty administration, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom," she said.
"After the sixth day of November, I'm going to think carefully about running for president."
Warren praised President Donald Trump on the occasion by saying that “he is taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has appeared outright in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, according to a poll released on Thursday, a majority of Warren’s voters do not support this nomination in 2020.
According to a study by the University of Suffolk’s Institute of Policy Research and the Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts do not support a senator’s nomination.
32% were in favour of resigning.
A number of respondents supported the appointment of former Governor Deval Patrick with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 election that have been featured in the debates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will formally decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin Refers to Her Son's War Trauma at Donald Trump Election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting for the military in September.
Track Pali was arrested on the night of Monday and was charged with domestic violence.
“From what my own son has to go through after returning home, I can very well identify with other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are bringing home,” he told a crowd gathered in Tulsa, Oklahoma for the Donald Trump campaign.
Pali called the arrest a "flowing horse in the living room" and said his son, like other military veterans, "return home a little changed, they return hardened, they return wondering if they respect what he and his comrades in the army and have done well in the air force."
Track Pali was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday, according to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, who was charged with domestic violence and abuse of women, as well as domestic violence and gun-handling intoxicated.
18 States and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit filed against a new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking a change to a new line in the U.S. that does not grant asylum to people fleeing gang-rape or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the federal district have left the letter "Friends of Justice" on Friday in Washington, D.C. The letter supports the alignment of infringing asylum seekers, reports NBC News.
The full name of the proprietor has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal alignment.
He tells his partner "and his sons who belong to the violent gang" abused him. U.S. authorities denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s attorney general described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which are home to U.S. asylum seekers, as states where gang and domestic violence are a problem that is common to all levels of society.
A new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Asylum Appeals Board that allowed undocumented migrants to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new line "over the decades of state, federal and international law will be ignored".
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be resolved on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter reads.
Prosecutors also argue in the letter that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from entering the U.S. economy is detrimental, as immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and “bring in the necessary additional labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to suspend the granting of asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence who fled the country.
"The asylum is intended for persons fleeing their homeland due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular class of society or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face on a daily basis all over the world.
The desperate rescue efforts of the survivors continue in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“The situation is very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her fever at her baby’s Palu evacuation centre in the ruined city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring in new bodies every minute.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered goods and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged in the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, severe post-traumatic shocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he wakes up, how a furious earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We couldn’t save ourselves.
I was stuck between the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, and said he was in town with his family as wedding guests.
"I heard my wife yelling for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of "Provoking" with "Propaganda"
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. newspaper, praising the interests of the U.S.-China interim agreement.
WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid China Daily appendix to the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6th congressional elections.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s involvement in the U.S. election mark a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to pressure China, according to U.S. officials.
While it is normal for the foreign government to disseminate notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an ever escalating trade war, in which both parties in turn impose customs duties on the counterparty’s export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime governor of the state of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the U.S. workforce, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
“China is now accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press,” Branstad wrote in his opinion paper published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the United States' revered traditions of free speech and the press by placing a paid notice in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In the newspapers in the streets of Beijing, however, divergent opinions appear only limited, and real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy do not see at all. This is because the media is strictly on the sidelines of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad goes on to say that “one of China’s largest newspapers avoided publishing the offer” in an article he wrote, but did not specify what magazine it was about.
Kavanaugh fiasco bans women voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top Republicans are standing behind and defending the Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh could, according to analysts, cause a counter-reaction, especially in the upcoming midterm elections for women voters.
Emotions surrounding the case have been going through major rounds, and most Republicans have already announced their wish to move forward in the vote.
“Such things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell Institute, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher doesn’t believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona) is resolving angry voters over a last-minute offer to investigate the FBI.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday and they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and spokeswoman for the national reform group MoveOn, told a newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted "November is coming" when they expressed their opinion on the Senate corridors when the ruling Republicans of the Senate Committee decided to move forward on Kavanaugh's nomination, which happened despite Dr. Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reports.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in an interview with the news site.
“People say the excitement has already been high, and it’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among the insecure female voters in the neighborhood and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Analysts are anticipating a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans go ahead with confirmation before Ford’s testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his claim of sexual harassment.
“This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed for questioning; it's about how the Republicans have acted on the matter and how they have treated Ford," Guy Cecil, head of the Democratic-backed Priorities USA, remarked.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided about whether they should believe Ford or Kavanaugh’s witness testimony when a small majority of the latter is bent on the latter.
According to a new survey conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony absolutely or likely, while 35% say they believe absolutely or likely Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Flaken's move forward, the FBI investigates Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford solemnly testified before the Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had harassed him while he was drunk when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee revealed his genitalia at a student party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet as Anti-Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project, Inrupt, is based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt’s intention is “to rule the world”.
“It has to be done now,” he said, referring to his startup company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse” or POD.
It can include contact lists, memory lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal data storage is that it is completely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through the data".
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes and required skills to bring Solid to everyone’s reach.
The company currently includes a security platform acquired by Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM, some of the hired developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website. All of this will be available from this week.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not discussing "with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change with all of their business models turned on their heads overnight."
"We don't ask for their consent."
In an article published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the consistency and quality of the new network built for Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute after Inrupt was launched.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the next era of networking," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the heroic priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest of the Church of England awarded with the Victoria Cross medal, serving as a soldier after 100 years of events.
The Medal of Honor was awarded to Colonel Colonel Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 as a result of the attacks on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Vann's death, however, was created four days later without ever knowing of the highest honour given to him by the British Army.
Two of his grandsons were revealing a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the memorial was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's wedding.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under the fire of heavy field artillery and machine guns."
Later, he fell to the front line and "showing the greatest audacity" led to the advance of the troops before the fielding alone. In the ensuing battle, Vann shot down three gunners with his own hands.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper who was created on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.

Friends of the Libertarian Party were waiting to watch the Bellator 206 tournament all night – the TV channel showed Pipsa Possua
Imagine a situation where you’ve been monitoring the entire night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the entire event is presented.
The event in San Jose had 13 matches, six of which were in the main series, and the show was scheduled to air live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the show, Pipsa Possuu turned into a big shock to viewers.
Some of the spectators weren’t really happy with being watched all night because of the match.
A friend of the liberation movement opened up on Twitter describing the replacement of the match with children portrayed as "a kind of sick joke".
“According to the law, that content was not appropriate for presentation at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to change it to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication.
"Pipsa Possu, yes".
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said the schedules will be worked out so that UK viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a relay that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
“However, it’s six o’clock in the morning there, and we’re not allowed to present the show until Sundays before our time, which in turn is Mondays at their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their head, the messages began to move in one direction and the other and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but it was a legislative matter.
I can assure you that next time this will not happen.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is a sad situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels He's Undervalued for His Sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he feels inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
The 24-year-old says he only noticed when he was in high school that “not everyone is the same as me.”
Lauren Laverne, speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, said she spoke about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also explains how, after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, the regular narrator of the long-term radio program, has been taking several months off due to illness.
In her guest appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "less young" than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work."
“To this day, these feelings, feeling less and different, have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I needed to succeed,” he says.
He says he wants to prove himself to be ‘something’ so that he doesn’t disappoint everyone when his sexuality is finally revealed.
A double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he will appear at this year’s Commonwealth Games in a bid to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells the story of his love for the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - as a "funny surprise".
Daley went on to marry this self-made 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says age difference has never been a problem.
“If you experience so many things when you’re so young,” she competed in her first Olympics at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find another person of the same age who’d experienced similar experiences,” Daley says.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley’s “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning the gold medal,” he says.
"You know, there's more to it than a gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
Her son was named after Daley's father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father never accepted his death, and one of the last things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets was that he wanted to sit in front of him.
“I couldn’t tell him he wasn’t going to be there anymore to be ahead,” Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. Only when her breathing had really stopped and she was dead, I finally realized that she wasn't invulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew this was something I’ve dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of the home audience at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for her first song selection in the show – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which already aroused emotions as she was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets her skin into chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's midfielder at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to be tricked into avoiding the record round as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays every two years at a record-breaking event, moved to the bench for the 12th time by captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball and foursome on Saturday.
Typically, the American five-time Major Tournament winner spent half of the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the pitch trying to take control of his strike.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National, where a long-growth bullfighter punishes for inaccurate beatings.
If there isn’t enough resistance on the field for Mickelson himself, in Sunday’s ninth game against him is the well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays in conjunction with the upcoming Tommy Fleetwood, who is aiming to place the four-winning tube this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind when they come to 12 doubles games, get a flying start, Michelson’s game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could he say in the situation.
"He fully understands the role in which he played today. He patted me on the back, routine and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought otherwise, but that's how this went and we ended up with a solution like this.
He wants to be there as much as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for several Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, however, was never comparable to his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence will bring something unspecified to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s rude, he likes people at the expense of being rude, and he’s a funny guy that everyone likes,” he explains.
"I'm sure the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week. It's fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a leadership position can be lost quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup’s huge lead position before the last day’s doubles can be a turbulent journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderra, where Seve Ballesteros led the side with a five-point lead over the Americans, but who managed to win on the limestone lines right at the waist of his nose and won at the narrowest possible margin141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds itself of how we led sluggishly in Valderra, we led sluggishly in Brookline, where we lost, but we won sluggishly in Valderra," Bjorn said after looking at the 2018 team's 5-3 wins, both on Friday and yesterday.
The story will show both me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We go to the field and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and we are only aiming for it.
As I’ve always said, I’m focused on these 12 players who are playing for us, but we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Excited at how his team’s players have performed on a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I’ll never be a nuisance until I get into things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, the priority will be individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a partner when everything is going well, but when the field is alone, then the player’s capacity is tested on the basis.
This is a message that must be conveyed to the players – tomorrow everyone should be able to perform at their best.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced a full turn of the last day in both directions. He was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as a loser when the European team won "Medina's Miracle".
“I remember every bad word,” he answered the question of how 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw lined up his team for the last day’s experience.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like it happened at Brookline, or like it happened at Medina.
When a thing moves in one direction, it accumulates a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We’ve adjusted our composition accordingly and put the boys on the field the way we want, as you know, we’re going to do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense fight and he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in line to face their European opponents.
"I put the team's guys in this order because I think it carries the whole tournament," Bjorn said.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been launched in 2014. The ship is intended to replace the outdated equipment of the Cold War, but it will be deployed by the earliest next year due to faulty systems and explosively increasing costs, local media reports.
According to a military reporter for Die Zeit, the deployment of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have haunted the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
According to the available information, they will be equipped with an effective gun, missile systems for combating air and surface vessels, and with debris technology such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signal sensing technology.
An important feature of the vessel is also its longer service interval – the new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the dock.
The continuing delays, however, mean that the warships at the forefront of technology – which are said to be intended to improve Germany’s influence in overseas territories – are already outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate ended up in the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the yard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the ship after its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have spoken of essential "software and hardware" that render the warship invalid for combat missions.
Programming deficiencies are particularly important because the crew size of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet’s possibilities for subsequent upgrades.
With a capacity of 7,000 tonnes, the Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the entire price tag of the project is also a growing problem.
The price is said to have risen to a staggering amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, when the original price was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have emerged as Germany’s maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee of the German parliament, noted that the fleet's useful vessels "are on the decline".
According to the Authority, the problem has increased over time because old vessels have been discontinued but no new ones have been replaced.
He complained that no frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be deployed.
The environmental organization smuggles into the secret life of the butterflies
A new study in the Scottish Highlands seeks to find out how butterflies exploit the terrain when hunting for food.
The new study hopes to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future conservation measures.
The National Trust for Scotland researchers conducted a study of the dwarf and dwarf packs, as well as earplugs and water snails in the Inverewe Garden, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, specific storage devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of butterflies during the period.
The organization’s employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observatory devices.
The frequency of the polls and the species concerned shall be ensured by an analysis by experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and a report will be created, in which the behaviour of molluscs can be represented in a picture that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s conservation consultant, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for butterflies, and how different species make use of them.
This information will help with the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account butterflies and related species.
The butterfly populations of Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined considerably over the last hundred years.
Construction and land construction work threatens the resting places and habitats of butterflies.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flies and certain chemicals used in building materials and pet dog attacks.
They are not actually blind.
However, due to the general hunting practices, their ears have more benefits in catching than their eyes.
Snakes use advanced spot detection technology to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental protection organization that maintains over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land – and they take butterflies seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of resting places and, in some cases, rescue operations for animals.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only protected area for butterflies in the Dumfries and Galloway area of Thraven Manor, where eight of Scotland's ten butterflies are found.
According to health care provider David Thompson, the area is ideal for butterflies.
"Threave is very suitable for bedbugs," he says.
“We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
We don’t know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us better understand what bats need to succeed.”
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for butterflies before refurbishment, as the destruction of a single butterfly’s resting place can inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female and boy hostages and destroy the entire local population.
Refuges are protected animals and their killing, harassment or destruction of their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Flemish Protection Organisation, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we still don't know how their populations will cope."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing for trial against German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape charges against him as "currency" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action on the allegations by publishing a German magazine Der Spiegel to challenge the court.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid the victim $375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram to 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. A 33-year-old footballer sharply rejected the accusations and described them as "currency."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to challenge Der Spiegel’s claim to the court that they have called the Reuters news agency “inappropriate reporting of suspicions of privacy protection.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding compensation for "spiritual suffering according to the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged case is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reported to have met at the nightclub and moved to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped him anal, according to papers delivered to the Nevada Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent good guy", but that "one percent" caused disappointment.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of his injuries at the hospital, but later ended up in a conciliation settlement because he was "afraid of the possibility of revenge" and worried that he "would become the object of public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking to cancel the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to a deal to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overhaul from Manchester United, and transferred to the Italian power team Juventus for a $100 million contract.
Brexit: Britain 'repents forever' on end of car manufacturing
Britain “would feel forever” if it lost its position as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerning" the announcement by Toyota's UK unit to temporarily suspend production at its plant near Derby in Burnaston if Britain pulls out of the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
A Japanese carmaker says the impact of border crossings will be visible as job losses if Brexit is concluded without a deal.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain abruptly pulls out of the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers operating in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced it will shut down its Mini factory for a month in the event of Brexit.
The main concern, according to car manufacturers, concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line will be run on the timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from the UK and the EU, and the cars will be manufactured on request.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause border disruptions, which the industry says could lead to delays and parts of the deficit.
Keeping a warehouse that lasts more than a day at the Derbyshire plant is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be halted.
Clark says Theresa May’s EU relationship plan is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We want the best deal possible, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we must take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Not only Toyota, but also the statements of other manufacturers show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chain series so far.”
Toyota is unable to tell how long production should be halted, but warns that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and works as a trade union executive at the factory, says the concern among the members is growing: “In my experience, lost jobs never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Assistant Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “forced to move one more week” around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh due to a debt obligation, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s involvement in the elections, the ties of Trump’s aides to Russia, and the possible actions of the president to prevent justice.
Washington has been rumoring for months that Trump is going to resign the deputy justice minister, which would jeopardize the impartiality of Mueller’s investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported on Rosenstein’s discussion of the possibility of recording covert talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of the president’s resignation under Appendix 25 of the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has been reported to have been Rosenstein's resignation from office.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "would not prefer" to secede Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's plenary vote.
Trump’s chief press officer, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News’ Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "There is no date set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed by another week because of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
But I always want to keep the press up to date."
Some of the journalists may disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Newspaper journalist Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for the lack of press conferences was due to reasons other than dislike for the "attention" of TV journalists, but said: "I do not deny the fact that they are attention-seekers."
Sanders, however, made it clear that direct contacts between Trump and the press were on the rise.
“The president holds more questioning hours than any president before him,” he says, adding, without citing further evidence: “We’ve checked those numbers.”
"Press meetings will still be held," Sanders said, but "it is infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We are trying to do this often, and you have seen that we have done this many times in recent weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open events or press conferences with celebrities visiting.
Being alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president possibly pointed out the reason for this when he appeared unobtrusively and from time to time strangely to the journalists gathered there.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to workers of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries on fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to employees of the Scottish healthcare system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs incurred by applications for a "established status" of EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: During the summer, secession negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up its preparations for possible non-agreements.
I know that for all of you these are uncertain times.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees to citizenship, regardless.
Colleagues from all over the EU and from outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Tennessee State Tigers backer Christion Abercrombie has been in an emergency operation since the team lost 31-27 Vanderbilt to the Commodore on Saturday, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He came to the sidelines and just shrugged at it,” Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sidelines before putting him in pairs and taking him to the sidelines for a more detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV channel reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had received surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/size of the injury at this stage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for the first time in a team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five backs on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 backs this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
The aim of the change is to neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters
The levy of stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers today about the higher stamp tax rate when they buy properties in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters, and Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of good income.
The increase in stamp duty is aimed at people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money from this will be directed to government actions to ease the distress of the homeless.
The surcharge – which will be added to the current stamp tax, in addition to the second and investment housing increases added two years ago – can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 per cent of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-house buyers to enter the property market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital – have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and leaving it unbuilt, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon quotas for affordable housing to correct Britain's "shameful housing situation."
Corbyn has published a noteworthy series of proposals to reform the housing market, including rent restrictions and the cessation of "confidential provisions".
He would also like to give more power to the councils in matters relating to the construction of new housing.
“I said last year that I intend to own the British dream of restoring my prime ministership – that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy homes as easily as busy British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become a far-reaching dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "extreme goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about his challenge to lift the team from the north corner of the country back to their home base and is currently in third place in the British second division.
Ross moved to the "lights stadium" this summer after he led St Mirren back to the Scottish league last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my team.
I got into the second team and it was there," Ross told BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
“When I was a kid, I often watched Scottish games at Hampden with my father, and it’s something that has always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as the manager of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he wasn’t worried about getting into the shoes of his famous predecessors in a well-known company, having previously rejected offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I'm measuring my own success with whether I can return this club to the league.
Based on the structure and capacity of the association, it is undoubtedly part of the elective league," he says.
"Your access is not easy, but I would probably consider myself a success only if I can trust the team back to the league."
Ross has only served as manager for three years: first as assistant manager at Dumbarton and then for 15 months at the Heats coaching team.
After that, he helped Alloa rise from the three-series downhill games and promoted St. Mirren's downhill team to champions during the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably in a real crossroads with my career," he recalls the time when he moved on to lead Alloa.
“I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, I earned moderately well, and I was able to enjoy some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be difficult.
The player has to deal with a lot of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and work pressure, but leading the team feels like the right task.
I’ve always wanted to lead the team, and now I’m doing it for my job. I feel better in my own body than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”
The entire interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday 30.9 on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a drink is on Saturdays at 5.30 pm, research shows
The summer heat wave has kicked off pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on the food chain.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultancy with CGA, said: “Continuous sunny weather and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was the highest turnover for pubs like June, with a drop of 2.8%.
The June 1.8% drop in restaurant sales only worsened in July.
Drinking-side pubs and bars were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the drop in restaurants sales.
Food-focused pubs also suffer from vomiting, but less dramatically than restaurant runners.
Looks like people just wanted to get out of their minds.
The sales of bars and pubs operated by companies increased by 6.6% over the course of the month, and food sales fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, from RSM, which provides leisure and hotel restaurant consultancy services, said: “The results continue the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are increasingly the biggest factors influencing the sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is not surprising that the food chain struggle will continue, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is sharpening, especially now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
Long hot summers couldn’t have gotten worse for the actors focused on sewing food, and only time will show if the warmer temperatures of the industry bring the breathing season they desperately need.
Total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.

One-Fiveth of Children Hide Social Media Accounts From Parents
One-fifth of children – some of them up to 11 years old – hide social media accounts from parents and teachers, study says
Study of 20,000 High School Students Reveals the Increasing Phenomenon of ‘Instagram Fake Accounts’
The news raised concern that accounts can be shared with sexually explicit content.
20 percent of students say they have a ‘end-of-account’ that is shown to parents
A fifth of children – some of whom are up to 11 years old – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the fast-growing existence of ‘Instagram fake accounts’, referring to the Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has heightened fears that accounts may publish sexually explicit content.
20 percent of students said they would like to show their parents a clean ‘head account’ while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after colliding with her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Board of Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds held two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted they held secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are attracted to setting up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle's "voice of athletes" to Scottish Athletes' Government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-member of the Scottish Board of Athletes and participates in the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athletic athlete. Board Chairman Ian Beattie describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience the athlete has gained over the last decade.
“Yesterday is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the government,” Beattie says.
Doyle says: “I look forward to my role as a voice of athletes and hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sport in the right direction.”
A four-time Olympic gold medal-winning American athlete who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now serves as a regular commentator on the BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient brain circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.”
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time will tell if I'm recovering and what condition.
This has been a tiresome job, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Mothers-to-cow-like advertising to share opinions online
The breast pump company’s breastfeeding mothers have shared opinions on the Internet.
Consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has brought to market a product called "the world's first noiseless and over-the-top breast pump". Its marketing is accelerated by a tongue-in-the-pocket and music video-style ad that describes the new wood.
Four real-life mothers dance in a pig-filled nave with the following song: "Yes, I'm licking myself, but the tail is not visible" and "if you don't happen to notice, they're not uterine but they're boobs".
The story goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my bread."
However, an advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked a discussion online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has aroused conflicting reactions among viewers, many say it makes a mess of the dairy industry’s daily ‘horror’.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them soon after birth,” one commentator writes.

Another viewer commented: "Understandably, it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can’t they be used to advertise the breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
The third commentator added: "Advertisement of a complete reality escape."
The ad also got advocates: a woman admitted to the ad that she thought it was "wonderful".
“I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product,” reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a fun advertisement that is aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and ‘feel themselves like cows’.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women in the video reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps into their bras diluted.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and it fits imperceptibly into the lactating suits, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balar, partner and artistic director of the Mother Spice Office, commented: “The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By matching breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump to the light beam, we brought out the incredible sense of freedom brought by the new pump in an entertaining and recognizable way."
The Elvie pump has been in the headlines before.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk wearing a product by designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the rude rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, the placement of children in foster families is still.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of undocumented immigrants, and enrolling as a foster family can jeopardise their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential local families and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the high-level immigration and customs authority, testified last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for asylum for minor immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees did not have a previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we're going to keep looking for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal with children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with in court within one month of the arrest, instead of the 60-day time limit previously in use, the reception centre employees say.
Many people prefer to take part in videoconferences rather than personally taking part in the proceedings before the court on the cases of immigrants.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for assistance shall be immediately deported.
According to reports published by reception centre staff and the system in recent months, the time spent in children’s detention will affect whether children are beginning to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent eruptions or forced evictions.
According to the lawyers, the concern is particularly high in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child desperation may go unnoticed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without being given enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria Orders U.S., French and Turkish “Occupy Forces” to Leave Immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as the deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were illegally in the country on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and that "they will act accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem said the “anti-terrorist war is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions of people have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue a “sacred struggle until the whole of Syria has been cleansed” of both terrorist organizations and “illegal foreign forces.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and mentoring Kurds and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed more than 1,000 troops to the country in the rubble of the fighting.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were good for the return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
“We have called on the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until the end of the war has been agreed by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the territory of three million people.
Moualem, however, has stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters on the al-Nusra front, “who will be destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of the new government and the opposition committee to draw up a post-war draft constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against meddling in the matter.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
Under this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the assassination and scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential decision ever!”
To date, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time has more than doubled with CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled with MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best viewing time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has reached cable TV: the top chemistry with 3.5 million viewers as the main news shows.
“This is a whim that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor, from the minister who will be president after the attack destroyed the congressional building.
Nell Scovel, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has an amusement value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the news from Washington can determine what happens in the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant family members get to each other and how the world economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the responsibilities of an informing citizen to look at a six-hour panel of experts arguing that Bob Woodward’s source data was used for the Fear book, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 squirrel-like pilot jacket.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario again the same way I did before.
"What he does feels like a real-world TV show, because in part it's about giving the audience something every night," says Wheelhouse Entertainment director and creator of the Panty Loan show Brent Montgomery Trump.
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a lovely sunny day at his place on the North Coast of Kauai, but he couldn’t get out because he was watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He could not separate himself from the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Committee on Justice and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

From the outside, money flows into a tight midterm campaign
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency has faced a real cash flow, as the reorganization of congressional districts requires two already elected candidates to fight from one place.
This recently re-districted Pittsburgh constituency is a challenge to Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his place from another constituency in last spring’s special election.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th constituency, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The division of territories was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old electoral division favored Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has started an economic struggle in the main party finance departments of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name came to prominence in Pennsylvania after the March special elections of the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat had been Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 percent.
Political commentators have paved the way for Democrats.
U.S. Plans Punishment for El Salvador for Chinese Support, But Withdraws Its Intentions
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and Washington’s slight counter-reaction.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama “on the basis of recent guidelines that Taiwan is no longer recognized,” said Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement.
However, only El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, as well as development and economic support, was considered to be fined.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit a Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and deaths.
As the internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity, a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step in efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that the meeting was wanted to move forward and this effectively decided on speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give some kind of signal to the meeting scheduled for mid-October as to what kind of weight the administration will give to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further nasty messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the conversation with three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in defence of anonymity.
History Teaches
The next inevitable step may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Trump’s possible deprivation of justice, which is now very compelling evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to be investigating whether Trump’s campaign worked in secret with Russia when Russia was involved in the US election.
If the power shifts in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable for it just as he prepares to go back to his voters, and possibly face condemnation from his peers.
There are a lot of jokes here, and I don’t mean to say that President Trump’s loss would be inevitable – more so than the loss of similar people in Europe.
We have to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions will determine the length of this struggle.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points where the inevitable progress of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been charred since the news came that he had proposed to secretly record the president’s speech and considered the possible inability of the president to handle his office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is incorrect.
“What will we do if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh’s actions is not complete or fair — or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest witness testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections to hold President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these experiences, our democracy will have a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Jewish in Czechoslovakia and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic pocket.
He survived, moved as a migrant to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated by a hawk.
How can I be more than optimistic about the future?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans as optimist for Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home in Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win by the Austrians after a match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month would give the team a strong position to reach the European League G-League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorran from entering the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a booster for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
We might have been able to catch the win at the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got to speed in the second half and we were better.
Thursday is another big night in the Europa League.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this team we will be able to give everything we can and we will achieve a positive result.
“Last year was really tough in terms of my injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The setup is good and the boys enjoy it; the workouts are going well.
Hopefully we can now put the full weight, leave the season behind us and succeed.”
The Fear of Retirement Takes Women to Sleep
Although the study participants had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken about it to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of national life insurance.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Discuss with a professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important cost determining factor.
Take financial advice into the discussion: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-insurance if you can afford it.
Create legal documents: Prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative on-site so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drafting a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to identify a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you can’t take care of them yourself.
Also remember the little details: imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Type such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just about the financial side. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
“What medications are being used?
Who takes care of the dog?

He was shot several times in Ilfracombe.
The man was shot several times by airstrikes while walking home late at night.
The 40-year-old victim was shot in the chest, stomach and arm of Ilfracombe in the Oxford Grove area of Devon.
The police described the attack at around 2:30 a.m. as a "accidental act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed to eyewitnesses.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said.
In the absence of communication links to the area, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the northern part of the area of the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the 7.5 magnitude quake surface centre.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located on a narrow bay off the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit the city on its 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) along the northwest coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality of Donggala is the administrative district of the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular of the Donggala coastal region, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal in Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have hit several tsunamis over the past hundred years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck Indonesia’s most populous island, Java, south of the island, causing a tsunami that struck the island’s southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, which is the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the islands of Sumatra Mentawa, causing a ten-metre-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial shock hit Acehin Pidie Jaya area causing destruction and panic as people remember the massive destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
The eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Track Palin has been arrested on charges of overcrowding.
A police report on Saturday said Pali, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and of preventing and resisting a declaration of domestic violence in connection with the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from a female companion when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in Mat-Su Pretrial Investigation Prison and has been ordered to pay $500 for bail, according to KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived at the court on Saturday and replied that he was "absolutely innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, for which he can be sentenced to one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time he's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with abusing his father, Todd Palin.
Palin’s mother called the police and reported the incident.
The case is currently being dealt with in the Veteran Court of the Netherlands.
In January 2016, Palinia was charged with domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of punching her in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to a traumatic stress disorder caused by service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications connections are out and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside of central Sulawesi on the northeast side of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media from the moment of shock.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing a rare death penalty on suspected NYC terrorist attacker <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipoville, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in October in his seat on the bike path on Manhattan's South West Side Highway, where he drove over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a statement from the New York Southern District, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, federal law imposed a 22-part charge on Saipoville, which included a charge for eight murders in support of a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal name for organized crime and intra-crime cases. In addition, intra-crime cases, intra-crime.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out his actions "horrendous, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It’s been a decade since the Court of Justice of the Southern District of New York has handed down the death penalty.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in the New York federal case in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that his actions felt good, police said.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-part charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defense officials, said the defense was “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life without the possibility of liberation is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused to those involved in these events," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously requested that he not be required to face the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says that Nigel Farage should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised in a protest against the Conservatives to "mobilize the Civil War."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives suggested her to lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative lawmaker Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Britain would "be already out" if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But May faces the gaps in her deeply divided lines as she reconciles the challenge underlined by conservatives in favour of staying, who were involved in a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface in the grip of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
Supporters are urging him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a backlash - and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "snap the Chequers proposal to go".
He suggested that Farage should be included and should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I defend Brexit, but the Chequers proposal needs to be eliminated."
He defended the European Union, saying: “We did not fight World Wars to end our wars.
We want to regulate our own laws in our own country.”
Bone slammed the idea that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay is a completely wrong statement."
Conservative Brexit proponent Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party nor by the activists who really take to the streets and are at all responsible for our success.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: "Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs while they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians need to feel pressure if they are going to reverse the decision made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is a question of trust between the people and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to water Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t accept it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to turn the Brexit, to feel the pressure behind you.”
"We intend to mobilize an army of citizens of this country that gave us a victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before the two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the "Tories Against Brexit" banners. The group was established this weekend.
The Labour Party’s Lord Adonis mocked conservatives about the security issues they had with the party’s application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they're going to get the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus and frictionless border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential nomination.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his recurring criticism of President Trump, will meet Republican Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign in November.
Warren is expected to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyok was his 36th meeting with voters since the start of the Trump season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that now is the time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest place."
Arrest in LSU Sims shooting case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a man suspected of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
Police had posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen in it.
The Sims, 20, were shot near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and died as a result," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being in the interrogation, holding a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
When Simpson was arrested, he was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 198-centimeter junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, playing 32 games and 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship of team arrangements offered to him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team arrangements played an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the ball and left Hamilton almost on his own luck in defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel teammates to attack.
Vettel went to the barge first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of hens, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes left the lane later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton passed away after making some contact and the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved off the inbound line, giving up his defensive position after two thirds of his move.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the start and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he led a large part of the race in lengthening the tyre change in order to finish fast and take fourth place from Kimi Räikköel.
He eventually came to the varsity in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight lap when Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day, because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job with a double win,” Hamilton said.
Extremely poor body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein’s claim that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking on the occasion in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Committee on Justice, but said that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of “people’s arrogance, arrogance and dishonesty.”
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, we've seen the pain, the people who are angry, the evil, the ugly and the dishonest," he said.
“When we see publications and stuff leaked and then they say, ‘Yeah, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you know this information?
Do you remember his answer...did you read the document - ‘oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed."
Wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t leak,” he added.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the charges against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein disputed that the leak had occurred from his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s accusations, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban did not apply to the president, who commented on the matter on Saturday: "Let me tell you, that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and considered the Democrats to use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They've decided to get back in power by any means.
You see that ugliness and chastity. They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to gain power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars claimed compensation for the loss of the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
Giantse had the lead in the early stages thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to levels before Dwyer returned to Giants' leadership position.
Francois Bouchard equalized with Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals ensured victory.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for the Adam Keefe men who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced each other for the fourth time in the season after the Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's innings. David Rutherford was innings when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the opening season, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed the Cownies' rematch at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first lap by hitting the evening's second goal at the end of the first lap.
The home team picked up their lines and Bouchard leveled again with the overpowering goal in time 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined their strengths and Nielsen managed to make Dundee their first lead goal at the end of the second set. He also ensured his team's victory in the fifth goal in the middle of the last set.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
The pilot died while ensuring that hundreds of passengers on the plane could escape the earthquake.
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero after his death by ensuring that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers was safely airborne.
More than 800 people have died and several have been missing after a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Severe aftershocks are experiencing the area and several people have been trapped in the decomposed material in the city of Palu.
Even though colleagues fled their lives in trade, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workplace in a wildly floating flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufr airport in Palu.
He remained in place and ensured that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely airborne.
After that, he jumped out of the flight control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s Yohannes Sirait said Agung’s decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
From Balikpapan, Kalimantan, a helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter got back.
“This news breaks our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of victims will rise to thousands, as the country’s disaster authorities have reported a shortage of links to the cities of Donggal, Sig and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in the ruins and not many people have been reached," Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, said.
Even six-metre waves have destroyed Palu, where mass funerals are held on Sunday.
Military and cargo planes bring aid and equipment to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: <0x23>Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
In an interview with CNN, Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what awaits us.
This is already a tragedy, but it can turn out to be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night so that all evacuation tasks can be handled.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now say one person is missing, although according to a previous announcement, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from a safely sinking plane.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate a single male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the storm and the precise course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the aisle.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to crawl in a sinking plane in the belt-deep water for emergency exits.
He said that the crew had panicked and shouted, and that he himself had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors involved in the rescue operations at a nearby port port were carrying people to the shore by rubber boat before the plane sank into the water about 30 meters (one hundred feet) deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the ruins of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not connected to the ruins.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a retrial in which a man was accused of burning a Mississippian woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, was an expert in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on his mobile phone to compile the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis accused and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers as the victim's death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was in violation of his earlier claims with Chambers the night he died, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have felt Chambers about two weeks after his death.
Based on the data stored on the mobile phone, they had known each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense's final speeches are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to proceed to the jury later the same day.
The High Breed: What Is Aware of Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions associated with the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in Britain with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?!
New York babysitter sues couple over racist text message <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A New York babysitter challenges the couple’s right to discriminate after accidentally receiving a text message from the child’s mother complaining that she is “a level one dark.”
The couple argues that they are racist and equates the challenge with "cultivation."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her regrets when the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and she found out that this was dark.
"EIIIIII, TAAS TUMMAIHOINEN", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But then she sent a message to Giselle Maurice, instead of her husband, twice.
After realizing his mistake, the troubled Plasco-Flaxman had separated Maurice, according to the New York Post, stating that his previous Afro-American babysitter, who had received their departure passports, had done his job poorly and this time he had expected the Filipinos.
Maurice got paid for one day of work and was sent home by taxi.
Now, Maurice is challenging the couple’s right to receive compensation for separation and wants $350 a day for the six-month period for which she was originally washed to live and work in the family, but without an agreement.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to racist allegations by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was a justified solution because they could not trust him after hurting him.
“My mother sent him something he wasn’t supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post in an interview.
“But would you leave your child in the spotlight with someone you’ve been unfriendly to, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
"Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge with harassment and said that his wife had had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Should we start chasing someone else in a situation like this?
It’s not very convenient,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, paving the way for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared that the public would not identify with the talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: "It is difficult to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It’s exciting now that Paddington’s huge popularity is known.”
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of the toy bear, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that on the eve of the publication of the books, his 60th anniversary felt dismal.
He described Paddington as "very important as a family member" and said his father was silently proud of the success it had achieved.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and not a ragging guy at all,” the daughter says.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; one you are proud of, even though it is not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was about his creation, he always gave honor to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter on the phone.
Her daughter was agitated by the plane after landing at the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“They played a little bit and told me the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to survive,” says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter is going to die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you, gold.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The medications that doctors used to keep his heart running gradually got out of his body.
He had died a little earlier, and now it's all gone.
I could just sit there knowing it was all over.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together.”
In the end, Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane among the other passengers - who knew nothing about the test she was currently going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
"I kept my head down and tears were pouring all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of compassion for Nadia.
That he now needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Suffering Women Send Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to stop other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler became depressed at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising chef with an infectious cold.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile illuminates the whole room.”
However, he quit his job before his death because he felt he was "in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's always afraid of the aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies's for several years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was down or depressed or anything like that,” Humphreys said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the country on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't take eye contact or anything like that."
He notes Mark's death has been a serious trauma for them, but they have to figure it out: "It breaks up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to go on and fight for it.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the brink of FBI investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he hoped - a time and scope-limited investigation - we could perhaps achieve a bit of unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "dissolve" due to the plight of supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republicans want an FBI investigation?
The counter-attack is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans’ success is as weak as expected, their quest to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush’s time, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI's report is drawn up?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is holding a vote.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's locomotive numbers drop during Kim's
The South Korean lawmaker said the number of people from South Korea to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came back to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Coordination as saying that there were 1,127 surges last year - 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the increase in the prices of smugglers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most of the North Korean loci will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a heavily demilitarized zone between Korea.
China treats smugglers as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Technically speaking, relations between North and South Korea have improved significantly in the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the stalled negotiations on the demolition of nuclear weapons.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed at a general level to pursue the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear non-proliferation.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of imposing sanctions after the meeting.
“Without any confidence on the part of the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances, we will in no case unilaterally begin to dismantle our equipment as the first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily incapacitated to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the matter in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved in this way, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in control of his emotions and sometimes he almost screamed and lost his ability to speak when telling about his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the committee’s Democrats without calling the accusations against themselves a “grote and planned persecution of a person” organized by the angry liberals over Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election.
Feari said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased towards Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent in his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
When he was asked if he would raise a charge against Kavanaugh, if this election were confirmed, and if the Democrats were to get a majority in the House.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he's currently working," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
He added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible provisions regarding the health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judiciary.
In the hearings on his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he annulled certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected to the court and we are expected to find it amazing,” Pelosi said.
Women need to cope with everything.
It is a legitimate firefighting when months and years of turmoil are over, and it cannot be held without crying.
“Let’s stay when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual at all, do you think?"
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her partner in a situation where she was angry and started crying, “You might think I’m crying now because I’m sad.
I'm really angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was a genius.”
Complaints are justified as a pathway to the eradication of bitterness, although they are generally fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of my early job in a male office is that once I cried out in a wordless rage and an older woman – a cold-blooded boss I had always been a little afraid of – grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, and then they’re happy because they’ve got your mind upset.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on this presidential campaign.
When Hart got caught up in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business in 1987 and got out of the race, Schroeder was very frustrated that there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and one more was needed the least.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
Since the campaign time was already long, he was behind the fundraising and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless it was worth two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
It was clear to him that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting something off?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he came under the power of his feelings - of gratitude for his supporters, of frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money for voters and not for delegates that he did not go to the polls, and he did not go to the polls, and he did not go to the polls, and he did not go to the polls.
"You could have thought I was getting a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled the press reaction.
"I could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone water will probably become a memorial.
“He was crying.”
How the U.S. and China trade war can benefit Beijing
The launch of the U.S.-China trade war has been deafening, and while the fight is anything but a passing one, a break-up of countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued a first warning earlier this year by imposing import tariffs on China’s most important export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new tariffs affecting imported goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded with the same measure every time, last by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US imports worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the U.S. face-to-face, and it does not seem that the world’s second-largest economic power is waning for a moment.
In order for Washington to resign, it would have to give up on its own demands, but the public worship of the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing dependence between countries.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic cycle in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than viewers have understood so far,” said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Security Center in Asia.
Syria's Foreign Minister Says It Is 'Ready' to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country after a devastating war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
The circumstances now allow the refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they had to leave because of the unilateral economic measures taken against terrorism and their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for the assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government does not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team by 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn team scored 14.5 points, which was needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson had difficulties almost throughout the tournament, and he hit his starting bet in the water with par-3 16 laps giving the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth came out with the result of 5&4 Europe's lowest-ranked player, Denmark's Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesenia.
World top player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament’s all-time winner European with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy to receive this victory.
It’s a team and I’m happy that I could be of help,” Garcia said after winning the European team.
He transfers the beacon to his countryman Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's 2&1 singles competition.
"I feel tremendous pride after defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up admiring him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
You will get statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and remains second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find their way all weekend except for Patrick Reedi, Justin Thomas and Tony Finauta, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said his team failed after the performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We beat the European team in this morning's games.
We got caught.
Thank you, Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We are regrouping, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we are moving forward.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I need to lift my hat.
