Members of the Welsh Assembly worried that it "looks like dolls"
Some Members of the Assembly have ruled out a proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This relates to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly were concerned that this could lead to laughter at the political level.
A member of the Labour Assembly said his group was concerned "that this is serious about Twp and Pwp".
Not for Welsh readers: "twp" in Welsh language means "crazy", and "pwp" means "cock".
A member of the Plaid assembly said the entire faction was "dissatisfied" and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his faction was "open" about the name change, but noted that it was an abbreviation of the word from MWP to "doll."
Because the letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the title, said: "The final decision on the names of all members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of the public consultations on proposals which received strong support for the Assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the names of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to the Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP received the greatest support during the public consultations.
Members of the House are obviously proposing alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement can become a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will also cover other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the disqualification of a Member of the Assembly and the Committee system plan.
During the debate on legislation, Members of the Assembly will have a decisive voice on what they should be called.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Name Change
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A global vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long persistently asserted that its northern neighbor’s name means claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposition to the plebiscite over the name change, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is simply a price that simply needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During Harlem’s troubles, St. Martin’s and other churches fell into disrepair.
“The old people I spoke to said that historically, a bar and a church could be found on every corner,” Adams said.
“You can’t find one or the other today.”
He said he understood why the bars were gone.
“These days, people communicate differently,” he said.
“Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.”
Speaking of churches, he is concerned that the money he gets from selling property will not be long enough, as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that churches can be replaced by multi-apartments with cooperative apartments, where people who will not help next to the remaining shrines will live.
“Most people who buy co-op apartments in these multi-apartments will be white,” he said, “and will therefore have the moment when the churches are completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these co-op apartments will be co-opted.”
Both churches were built by white congregations in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community, and St. Martin’s Church was built a decade later.
The first Congregation of White Methodists emerged in the twentieth century.
A nearby congregation of blacks took over the name of the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by a black congregation with clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a retail boycott on 125th Street, at the main Harlem store, where blacks were refused to be hired or assigned to higher responsibilities.
The building was severely destroyed by fire in 1939, but since the parishioners of his spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carnival.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of his spiritual father Johnson and heir to St. Martin’s Church, called a proud carillon “poor penises.”
The experts who captured the lynx called it "a treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionysus A. Linda. 18 years ago he started playing a larger carillon in Riversaid Church.
Merriweather said St. Martin’s Church had not changed him to another musician.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin’s Church has been a complex story involving architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by the Church’s secularists, others by the Episcopal Church’s diocese.
Zakristia, the governing body of the parish, made up of secular leaders, in July expressed concern to the bishop that the bishop would “try to transfer the costs” to Zakristia, although it did not hire the architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
A hurricane in California injured a catcher after 13-year-old man
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught the hats on the opening day of the locker-capture season in California.
He was attacked at 7 a.m. in Ensinitas near Brighton Beach.
Chad Hammelely told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been arguing with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then came back with the group to help get him out of the water.
Hammeli told me at first that the boy was worried about catching a closet, but then realized that the boy shouted, “I’m bitten!
I'm being bitten!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire keychain had been ripped off.
“I began to cry out to everyone to come out of the water, ‘A shark is floating in the water!’” added Hammelis.
The boy was flown by plane to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to being in critical condition.
What kind of shark was attacked by the boy, it is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the waist.
Officials closed the beach from Casablanca Point to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over from Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with its universal store-style beauty departments, where specialist consultants will work.
With the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow, and sales of fashion and household goods are falling, larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if more stores are in the market, they will catch up.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping malls are looking for ways to use shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has announced it will double its beauty assortment to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more local brands in areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The shopping mall is also releasing its Boutique makeup range again, most of which are vegan, which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test discounts at two stores at Sainsbury’s, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
Because of shopping online and the desire to buy small quantities every day from local essential grocery stores, shopping centers have to make more efforts to attract people to visit there.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that corporate outlets are increasingly looking like universal stores, as shopping mall networks are trying to fight the sale of goods that sell more cheaply to Aldi and Liddu.
Sainsbury's has included Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also installed a number of Habitat stores because it bought both networks two years ago, which are said to have boosted the profitability of food sales, and they will enter.
The previous attempt by the mall to renovate its beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
At the beginning of the first decade of the century, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up arguing about how to distribute revenue from drugstores in shopping malls.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its <0xC2><0xA3>125m drugstore business in 281 stores to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network Celesio.
Lloyds' contribution to this plan was claimed by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the exterior of the beauty department and the atmosphere to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to fit every need, and because of the attractive environment and comfortable places we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones Is 'Confused' by Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11m Deal With Him
“Dragons Den” star Peter Jones is “engaged” after TV host Holly Willoughby has cut a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for their home outfits and accessories for the Truly brand.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning broadcaster said in an Instagram account that she was leaving.
After Holly Willoughby left a lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV, she angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "engaged" at a tense meeting on Tuesday, when a gold television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlou (Bakinghamshire) admitted that new deals seeking to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m in cash and earning her a fortune would not be enough.
The business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop, and it was predicted to have doubled H. Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old H. Willoughby reported leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK for one of his summerhouses.
The source said: “Truly has been one of Holly’s top priorities to date.
It was supposed to be their long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone very much.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the start was so close.
The Marlou headquarters has a full stock of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe the departure of The Morning show’s leader, one of Britain’s most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to large investments in products, starting with pillows and candles, and ending with all-in-ones, all-in-ones and all-in-ones.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, H. Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
In 2016, Willoughby and Cappu founded Truly, and Jones joined the fight as chairman at the age of 52.
The couple are on vacation together, and Mr. Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S’s brand ambassador and replace I’m A Celebrity’s head of ITV, Anta McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
We talked a lot, and then we fell in love.
He ridiculed the criticism received from the media for the comment some might consider "non-presidential", as well as for such a positive reaction to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse so much?
A short voice from the "news leader" said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore, which took place in June, was supported by a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been tightened.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive a “relevant” response from the United States, according to a statement from the UN General Assembly.
He noted that the United States is continuing sanctions instead, which are aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his speech, he expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to fight with North Korea.
It would be fish for millions of people.
We are now in a very good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: it ended missile tests, aided by freeing hostages and returning home with the support of American troops.
He defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to get into this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
Indonesia's Cunami and Earthquake Destroyed the Island, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster – a prerequisite for providing international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it has been very clear that international aid is not needed, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While “Save the Children” is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether workers working abroad will be able to work on the spot.
A spokesman for the national disaster agency Sutopo said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In the face of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly not prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami reliefs were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
Due to the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the announcement, the number of lost lives is likely to increase.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands at the best time is difficult.
Due to natural disasters, logistics is becoming even more complex.
A hospital ship deployed in Lombok, where the victims of the earthquake are being treated, sails to Palu, but it will reach the site of a new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has chosen the rebuilding of Indonesia’s infrastructure as the center of his election campaign, and has generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not bring peace to the Joko administration, as he will again participate in the elections next year.
Joko is also under pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims adhere to a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, strings with arrows and other ordinary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge hits a long-distance equaliser in a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League in the 89th minute after hitting a touchdown on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Xherdan Shaqiri handed the ball to former Sturridge about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal in a 1–0 draw.
He smashed the ball on his left leg and hit the far corner.
High above the penalty area, the ball is lifted to the right upper corner of the net.
He eventually swung over the jumping Kepa’s Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get the ball into the position, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to stay as long as possible for the shot,” Sturridge said.
“I saw Kant running, I hit the ball with one rain, and, not thinking too much, I was just jumping.”
After Belgium's Eden Hazard's 25-minute knockout, Chelsea scored 1-0 from the first hurdle.
During the attack, the Blues returned the ball to Mateo Kovacici in the middle of the square and rushed towards Liverpool.
In the middle of the square, it quickly hit the wall.
Then the peacemakers sent the ball between the opponents to the penalized Hazard.
Gambling overtakes the defenders and through Liverpool player Alisson Becker with a left leg kicked the ball into the net at the far corner.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo (Italy) in Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in London on Thursday at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll from Indonesia tsunami has reached 832.
According to the country's disaster agency, the death toll in Indonesia from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, told a news conference that many people had been trapped in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by Friday's 7.5-point earthquake, which caused a 6-meter wave.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was razed to pieces by the collapse of buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Was Murdered
A murder investigation was started after a woman’s body was found in Berkenhead (Mercy) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. at Greison Mice, John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people who have seen or heard in the area to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still early, but I would like to address all those who were near John Street in Berkenhead and saw or heard someone suspected of contacting us.
I would also like to address everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have recorded something with a video recorder, and contact us because they may have the information that is essential to our investigation."
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Berkenhead and she was found in the building.
This afternoon my friends, who knew my wife, came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway as police say they are informing the victim’s close relatives.
A taxi driver living in Greison Mice just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one can enter and leave the building.
He lost pity when they found out what had happened.
Now the residents are told that they will have to wait a few hours before they are allowed to return home.
It was heard that a police officer explained to one person that the entire territory is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared to be in mourning at the crime scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were standing in front of the fence on the inside, and another van on the outside.
A number of officers were standing inside the fence and watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, with the number 247 on 30 September.
The statues of Parliament Cromwell are struck by the last blow of the “history rewrite” dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the actions of the Taliban, reminiscent of the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, for which the fanatical followers of the Cromwell Puritans are responsible.
However, Cromwell's companionship described Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the course of the current discussions on the transfer of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster House should inevitably have become a target.
Cromwell did not command or execute the iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Tom in the past century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a reflection of the 19th-century approach and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of honour.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, perhaps more rich in the late 19th century than they are today, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy.
Whether this is completely accurate, historians have argued so far.
One thing is clear: the conflict of the middle of the seventeenth century formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exclusive figure representing one of the sides of this plaque.
For as the Lord’s defender, so also the achievements are worth mentioning and honoring.”
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer Deadly
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a south-western Chinese market.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan had been found dead. He was bleeding from the damaged artery and was lying next to a piggy bank in Liupanshui Market, Guizhou Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Sininge, China, was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig litter.
He said he and his cousin from the neighbouring province of Juno were planning to travel to markets on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found a relative dead and found an open door to the nearby pig.
He said that there was a large hole in the pig's mouth that was smeared with blood.
As stated in the report, the court’s examination confirmed that a 250 kilogram pig had killed a farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, who gave his name to Wu, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the markets at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had to be locked in order not to intrude on other people and kept until the police collect evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating death compensation.
Although few, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and pressed it until the animal was taken away by his wife.
After the pigs were eaten by a Oregon farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but can be triggered by the taste of blood.
“They’re just playful.
She likes to sneeze, very curious... not wanting to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly,” he said.
Hurricane Rose Remains Will Bring Heavy Rain to Southwestern United States
Hurricane Roza is expected to weaken by moving through cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Roza will bring abundant rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday from 5 a.m. Roza moved at a speed of 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of the Eugenia cove (Mexico).
Roza is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific side begins to form a steep low-pressure zone and moves eastwards to the U.S. west coast. As Roza approaches the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry a high-temperature storm.
On Monday, Roza will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then the humidity of the rainforests, interacting with the upcoming high-pressure area, will bring a vast amount of rain to the southwest in the coming days.
On the site from 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause a dangerous flood of sudden floods, a stream of debris and a possible drought in the desert.
Due to the high rainfall in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, precipitation will fall from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
5–8 centimeters of rain is expected in southwestern regions, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Due to the nature of rainfall in the rainforest, sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible.
When going through tropical storms, a particularly bad idea would be to attract to the desert on foot.
Heavy rain canyons can turn into narrowing rivers, and percussion would cause wind and dust waves.
The impending low-pressure zone will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
You are likely to encounter more than 1 centimeter of falls, which can cause a small flow of debris, and the roads can become slippery.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some of the tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona again on Sunday and early Monday, and later rains will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will fall on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, because the Arctic is cold, but in the tropical zone it will be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to large changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was an excellent example of the huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature of Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) varies almost 20 degrees from the temperature of St. Louis and Di Moino (Ayov).
Over the next few days, the heat of February is expected to rise again and cover more places.
In much of the central and eastern part of the United States, from the Great Southern Plains to the North-Eastern Areas, warm winters are expected to come with a predominant 27-degree temperature.
The temperature in New York City is expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October will be higher than the average perennial temperature.
More than 20 million people watched the Bretto Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people on six television broadcasts on Thursday watched the causal attention of Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and his wife Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual violence in the 1990s.
But the political blind spot continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs over Friday’s last-minute change: Arizona’s senator has drawn up an agreement to allow the FTB to conduct a week-long investigation into allegations of bribery.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed her at a high school party and tried to take off her clothes.
When Kavanaugh testified, he said that he was absolutely certain that it was not.
Nielsen reported on Friday that, possibly, more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating the number of people who watch TV in the offices.
To make it clearer, it is an audience of the same size as would be created during replays of football matches or Oscars.
Nielsen said the Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s candidacy, was the first of all networks to reach an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day court hearing.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS received 3.1 million viewers, NBC received 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC received 2.89 million viewers, and CNN received 2.52 million viewers.
There was still a lot of interest at the end of the trial.
The main character in Friday’s drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when protesters shouted at him while trying to lift him to a court committee hearing.
CNN filmed it directly with its eyes down when it was flooded by people.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have more to say at a court committee meeting.
Cable television and broadcasting networks were later discussed directly when the Judicial Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FTB will investigate the accusations against the candidate over the coming week, which were urged by a minority of Democrats to investigate.
Flake, speaking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partially convinced.
After speaking with Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the FTB’s allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused her plans to leave the European Union critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and in order to harm the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party’s conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson went on to attack her so-called "Brexit" plan that Britain and the EU should raise tariffs on each other.
Wayde Sims shooting police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player's death
Police have arrested a person suspected of the shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and police said that during the beatings, Sims had lost his glasses.
The CBS branch of WAFB reports that the police took the glasses from the scene and found on them Simpson's DNA.
When Simpson was interrogated, the police reported that he had killed Wayde.
The lawyer says the bail for his release is $350,000.
The expert service of the Eastern Baton Rouge Parish on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a blow to the head that deviated from the neck.
The chapter is dedicated to the Louisiana State Police Escape Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the residents of the district who assisted in the investigation, after which the suspect was arrested.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement for "cruelty and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the young man averaged 5.6 points during the game and captured 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "shocked".
“That’s what we’ve been thinking about all along,” Wade said.
Volcanic eruption in the ashes of Mexico City
Ash has erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano, reaching the southern Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano when activated crater activity was recorded and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The city has witnessed many earthquakes and earthquakes.
The photos on social media show a thin layer of ash-covered car windshields in Mexico’s surroundings, such as Cho<0xC4><0x8D>imilke.
Geophysicists have observed that 72 km southeast of the capital’s volcanic activity increased when a 7.1-point earthquake in September 2017 struck central Mexico.
The volcano, called Donu Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Previous PostPrevious Independence Day Police Meet with Catalan Separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first year of Catalonia's vote to resign.
The riot police, which were holding back a group of masked separatists, were covered with eggs and powder paint, which caused a dark cloud of dust on the streets, which is usually filled with tourists.
The police used the sticks to stop the beatings that began later in the day.
Within hours, a group for independence chanting “Unforgettable, unforgivable” met with Unionist protesters who shouted, “Spain is alive!”
Local media reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is being treated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the independence region remain high.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but due to a large part of the vote, voters who boycotted the vote, who did not want to leave, were low.
According to the Catalan authorities, police across the region last year, in an attempt to stop voting in electoral districts, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes.
On Friday night, an independence group set up a camp to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police from taking place.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change course.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
“I watched parents cheering for those who can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a vitally important and hard-won victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia’s independence parties have struggled to keep up this year’s pace, when many of their most famous leaders are out of the way or out of the way, and have withdrawn to the Savannah.
A 42-year-old police mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is constantly growing,” he said.
On Saturday, Orioles Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidacy in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the recession and repression of democratic values demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonder. Arrested men entering the house by car
Three 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested after driving back into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, he could also be shot in the car or plane.
Manga's strike ensured Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Mengo's first lap guarantees victory
Moving to the top, Livingston surprised the Rangers, forcing Ibrox club manager Steven Gerrard to lose the second of 18 games.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be very important, as in a moment Gary Holt's team equalized with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains unsuccessful in the Premier League this season and will meet with the Hearts leaders next Sunday, from whom they are lagging by eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers European League matches were home to Vienna Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended its unmatched series of unbeaten games in the division to six, and head coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of losing, as he only changed Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed out on chances in a game with static guests
Even before hitting the innings, Holt's team due to its resilience, causing the Rangers a variety of problems, had long been expected to be ahead.
At first Scott Robinson penetrated and struck through the gates, then Alan Lithgow slid to fail to reach Craig Halkett's head handed the ball, and this smashed next to the gate.
The hosts, allowing the Rangers to play in front, did not worry, because they knew that they could cause problems to the guests by creating standard situations.
That’s how a decisive blow was struck.
The Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston began to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a joint effort to hand the ball over to the Menga, and the latter, after stopping it, gained a kick from the penalty area in the middle.
Since then, the Rangers have been in control of the ball for longer, but the home defense was undefeated and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no job.
The game continued on in the second hurdle, although Kelly had to work to defend Alfredoedo Morelos's blow to the gates.
Scott Pittman's shot by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked his leg, and after Livingston's next standard position Lithgow kicked the ball to the side of the gate.
The transfer of the ball continued to hit the Livingston penalty area, but each time it was pushed out, and two demands for a penalty – one for the collision of Halket with the post-change runner Glenn Middleton, and the other for the handball.
Analysis of the appearance of the phenomenal Livingston
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal Livingston game and the result.
All of them were great up to one and continued to exceed expectations for an ever-increasing game.
The style and staff of the game from the return to the highest level have almost not changed, but great merits should be devoted to Holt, as he came to ignite the team.
He was spoken by a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played brilliantly, focusing on a perfectly organized defense, and Menga appreciated Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose vigilance.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
While they are playing well under Gerrard, this time they are missing a lot to reach their level.
They hit a few decisive blows and only once penetrated the defense of the hosts. A certain alarm call in the middle of the table came to the Rangers team.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne has been accepted in various ways.
On Saturday (September 29th) there was a smile and a blue sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was President Erdogan’s last controversial visit to Germany on a day when he sought to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued over such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population community outside of Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from marching in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept him in their country.
Various protests show the division of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. A cyclist died in the car
A cyclist died in London after colliding with a car.
The accident occurred near Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a movable Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 p.m.
The driver of the car stopped, paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, picked up by a culprit who then fled. The accident occurred about 1.6 km away from Saturday's accident.
The city police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed, and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino prison. Six officers injured during the attack
The prison service reported that six prison officials were injured during a major riot in a special security men's prison.
The attack took place at HMP Long Lartin prison in Vuster<0xC5><0xA1>yre on Sunday at 09.30 BVL, where it continues.
Special officers from Tornado were called in to control the incident, which involves eight prisoners and is taking place in one wing of the prison.
Officials are treated for minor facial injuries at the scene of the incident.
A prison official said: “In order to control the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were called in.
Six of the staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are confident that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police and, possibly, will spend longer time than the game.”
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals, are being held at HMP Long Lartin prison.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated at the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, rioting officials were called to the prison to control a serious crash, during which some of the workers were wrapped in billiard balls.
Hurricane Roza threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its sudden flooding (for drought-stricken areas this may be helpful)
It’s not normal for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen next week when Hurricane Roza, with its remaining energy, drops through the desert’s southwest and poses a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced a surprise flood in western Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, sweeping south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
With the rain approaching again on Monday, Roza is expected to draw straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
According to the Finnish National Meteorological Service, “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or tropical depression no more than 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane not more than 64 kilometers from the Arizona border.
Using the latest models of the National Hurricane Center, it is projected that the rate of precipitation will be 5-10 centimeters, and in some areas of the Arizona Mogolon Rim the rate of precipitation will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the desert’s southwest, including the central Walini Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to range from 2.5 to 5 centimetres, and some may fall as much as 10 centimetres.
For people who are not affected by sudden floods, the Rose rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these falls may be beneficial because the southwest is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, and this corresponds to the second-highest category,” said weather.com.
First, Hurricane Roza travels to the coast across the California peninsula belonging to Mexico.
On Sunday, Roza, still in the category of a hurricane with a massive 137 km/h wind, is 619 kilometers south of the Eugenia peninsula (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific region and is therefore serious.
So it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with a tropical storm force Monday afternoon or evening.
Falls that disembark in certain parts of Mexico can be noticeable and pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the California peninsula to the northwest of Sonoro, it is expected to reach 8-15 centimeters, but it is possible that it will fall as much as 25 centimeters,” weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then draw north through Mexico as a tropical storm, later, on Tuesday morning, reach the Arizona border already as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday night again across Arizona will draw south to Utah.
“The primary danger expected from the Rose or its remains is a very high amount of rainfall on the California peninsula, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern United States desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is believed that these rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods, devastation in deserts and desertification in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsamer Norton. Arrest of four people suspected of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton's Excelsior terrace area around 4 a.m., according to BVL, Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
Police in Eivon and Somerset said a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials have appealed to all persons who may have any material filmed on a mobile phone about what happened.
Mr. Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the Democrat Party’s depravity, anger.”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the relentless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in his speech in Wilinge, West Virginia.
Mr. Trump said Kavanaugh had “experienced the Democratic Party’s mischief, anger” during his candidacy process.
Kavanaugh on Thursday testified to Congress in a harsh and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at a court hearing about his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said, “The Americans saw that day how brave, noble and courageous Kavanaugh was.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, that is, a lawyer with a reliable reputation in the field of public services,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's candidacy, while also talking about the importance of Republican election activity in the midterm elections.
“The most important election in our lives has been five weeks.
I don’t participate, even though I’m actually participating,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats were trying to “resist and prevent.”
CNN's senior assistant to the GOP chief said the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continue to rise
Authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many of them reportedly due to the massive waves hitting the beach when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when a six-metre-high wave began to cross the coast as many of them fatally displaced and destroyed everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5-point earthquake.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency, said in an information report in Jakarta.
“He didn’t crawl alone, he dragged cars, logs, houses, he hit everything that was on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, crawls the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
He said that some people climbed trees to avoid a tsunami and so survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Natural disaster agency photos from the air showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were demolished and demolished, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside town was further shaken by repeated strikes.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported that the energy released during Friday's particularly strong earthquake was about 200 times higher than the energy dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is reported that the cuna could have strengthened due to the geographic location of the city, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as “large” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped behind the ruins of the buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the coast, located 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said the communications networks “were completely paralyzed, so no information was received” from Dongala.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are moving to areas affected by the disaster.
It has been said that “this can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.”
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for noticing that the swarms hit Palu, although officials said the waves were coming after the warning was issued.
In the popular social media content, you can hear a man sitting on the top floor of the building, who, reluctantly, shouts about an impending tsunami to people standing on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a water wall collides with buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted the supply of electricity, cut off the communication networks around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the provision of aid.
Authorities said the army from Jakarta and other cities had begun to send cargo planes with aid supplies, but the evacuated people were still in dire need of food and other essential supplies.
The city’s airport was reopened only to provide aid and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba said that when World Vision staff from Dongal traveled safely to the city of Palu, where workers were gathering in the birch tents built in the office yard, the road was accompanied by devastated sights.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take complex steps to provide assistance in the disaster, some people complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were barred from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and staff employed abroad can only help when the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” Indonesia’s Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani told reporters.
“When the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can call for international aid, but that status has not yet been published.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing people expected their loved ones to become part of a miracle that will affect a bleak history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subando, head coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has trained the paragliders of two missing Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Monday, were his students.
“Because I’m a senior in paragliding, I’m carrying my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendona explained in detail how within a few hours of announcing the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, this news traveled through the paragliding sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app, Palu pa<0xC5><0xBE>avimos festival.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue squirrels.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he said.
Newport on the Levee has stolen $26,750 from the ATM.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled the ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment center on Friday morning.
“The driver of the car was empty of the ATM at the entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man “escaped from behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money to replenish.
According to the press release, witnesses spotted several suspects who fled the scene, but police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Any person with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he announced the changes to his Twitter account and wrote: “The person, formerly officially known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has been called Ye for some time and has named the eighth album by that name, which was released in June.
The changes began before Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release its new album, Yandhi.
The show must be replaced by singer Arian Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
This is not only an abbreviation of the current professional name – West said even earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
“I think that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when talking about the name of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the one and only, and turned into Ye, which means the reflection of our good, evil, confusion, everything.
The album is more reflective of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced a preference for the names Love and Fraternal Love.
Former West’s colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a pen and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) vows not to use soldiers against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th bloody repression against students of the year.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square “never to use military forces to calm the Mexican population.”
On October 2, 1968, as left-wing student movements began across Latin America, representatives of the military forces shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador solemnly promised to support young Mexicans every month by subsidizing students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence specialist who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. government agencies issued reports about artificial intelligence, even the fact that the U.S. is not an official artificial intelligence strategy at all.
China, meanwhile, presented its plan last year, aiming to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the U.S. and are looking forward to another breakthrough in the field of AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that another major achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Industrial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent corporate <0x2B> workforce.
In the 1990s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-rated American Othello player, and later became the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, in order to help find more insightful people.
Lee said that U.S. scientists often have a hard time trying to win state grants.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have shifted the minds of universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts on artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced its plan for the development of the new generation of artificial intelligence.
In addition, Lee said China’s National Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations donating money to U.S. scientists, but the academic quality of work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced an investment of about US$2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing more than US$100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the coming months, however, nothing has been done about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name means claims to Greek territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but opposition nationalists say the name change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the voter turnout will reach the minimum of 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
A referendum question was put on the ballot: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership after agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that collapsed in Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the youth of Macedonia so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
While it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said that it will adhere to the voting results and make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of violations before 1 p.m.
But voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaevas, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko vote in a referendum on changing the country’s name in order to open the way to join NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and sliding chairs in front of tents, which were built by boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with raised minds, not to enter through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can drill into others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investments.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said the “yes” result would be “assurance of our future.”
According to the results of the poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research on Monday, 30-43 percent of voters are expected to participate in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telema, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, 50 per cent of voters must take part in the referendum, plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-Caribbean government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero overcomes Brighton’s entire defense and profit incursion
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defense, and Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday while playing at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The 65th minute of Aguero’s inning seemed to be incredibly easy.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the pitch at the start of the attack.
Before breaking into the open field, he passed between the three Brighton defenders.
Aguero then rounded up four players wearing green shirts.
He lost his way through one defender, before moving several others across the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then she handed the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero from the penalty area with one push, and this right-footed kicked the ball into the right-hand side of the net, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has a problem with his feet," City chief Pepas Guardiola told reporters.
I thought he was playing 55-60 minutes.
Here's how it was.
We were lucky to have won a victory at that moment.”
However, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues make the first breakthrough in these Premier League games.
He won in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball during the attack while he was in the depths of the Brighton square.
At the left edge of the square between the two opponents, he handed the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane.
Sane pushed the ball forward with a few springs, while Sterling pushed towards the further swirl.
The Sky Blues attacker kicked the ball into the gates before even kicking off the field.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., City will meet with Hoffenheim in the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Zinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play friendly games with the Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of rebound competitions, there was no reason to rebound again.
The rival Scherzers hope to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in the rebounds; in the national league, they beat the Los Angeles Dodgers by one point.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals 5:2 on Friday night, at least had a chance to get a qualifying ticket, but will still have to make an effort to secure the right to play in the first divizione.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we’re going to be able to get on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people and another team will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you break up?"
The Nationals have yet to announce the start of Sunday's match, but in this case, they are clearly willing to release Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be 34 in the stadium of this match, took the throw training on Thursday and threw the position to occupy the usual day of rest for him – Sunday.
Washington's right-handed stats this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 cars over 220 2/3 pickups.
A Short Speech in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Speaking about the importance of Republican voters’ activity in the mid-term elections, the president indirectly mentions the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved in November will be put on the scales.
The most important elections in our lives have been held for five weeks.
“It’s very important that I don’t run ... but I’m actually running, that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
She continued, “You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see how it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how evil it is.
They don’t care what they hurt, what they slip through to gain power and control; that’s what they really want – power and control – but we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “oppose and prevent.”
“And you’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “the angry, the bad, the low-minded and the unjust people.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by mentioning the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused huge audience ovations.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you lost the document?
Uh, uh, how.
No, um... no, I’m waiting for one—it was really a bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party has lost its diversity.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted in favor of distrust of me, I wonder if I should have been surprised.
Finally, I am the newest of the Labour MPs who have been told that I am undesirable – and this is for my opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received similar threats because she has strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed by criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony, on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want a lot of members to be involved in the meetings and that the meetings are productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a local member of the Leiborist Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were just that.
It is unfortunate that the tone of many meetings today is not at all the same as the promises of a “softer, more pleasant” policy that have long been forgotten, even if it has ever been implemented at all.
It is increasingly evident that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the party’s leader, and my colleagues, whose political views, as I had previously believed, were similar, began to expect me to take a 180-degree turn and hold opinions with which I would never agree to the EU, or to the national consensus.
Whenever I speak publicly – and no matter what – on social media, there is a scrutiny of insults that encourage my resignation, a condemnation of the centre’s policy and a condemnation that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
In fact, I have been much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure a wave of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things in this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the same party of views, and with every “distrust” procedure or change in the electoral system, this party is becoming smaller and smaller.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that encourages me not to jump out, not to speak so loudly, and then with me “everything’s going to be okay.”
That’s not what I came to politics for.
Ever since I joined the Leiborist Party 32 years ago, as a pupil, I have been provoking Thatcher’s government’s negligence, which, in the true sense of the word, caused my entire school class to fail, and I have sought to obtain better public services from the ministry, whether for those who are in favour of it or for those who are in favour of it.
I have never concealed my politics, including the recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East should have been in any way surprised by my political views and disagreements with current leaders.
To those who promoted this procedure on Friday, I can say that as the country moves towards Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and public services, I do not realize the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message that I have for Nottingham Momentum is for my voters, for members of the Leiborist Party (or not): I am proud to be able to serve you and I promise that no threat to your revocation or political objectivity will stop me from acting in accordance with my own will.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
"Ayr"-"Melrose" – 38:17 Invincible "Ayr" conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts have distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this moment of triumph in the impressive, promising Tennent's Premiership day matches.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one not defeated.
Ultimately, the victory brought them impeccable defense and well-built opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've raised all the tests in all the matches that have taken place so far and we're still undefeated, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr turned out well, the players used their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, successfully completed by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but the yellow card to Scotsman Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose not to collect the number.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty when, before, in the middle of the race itself, he scored points and successfully completed the personal test, helping Ayr break up with a score of 17:5.
However, Melrose's second hurdle started well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggote successfully completed, narrowed the gap to five points.
The matches were suspended for a longer period of time, as Ruardha Knotts suffered a serious injury and was cleared from the field on goalkeepers. After the long-running matches, Ayr continued to move forward as Stafford McDowall's attempt was successfully completed by Cli.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the players' excesses, but Bruce Colvine's attempt at the end of the fierce pressure was unsuccessful.
The home team player returned, but when Strunan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Clima without the ball, MacPherson pushed the ball off the penalty line behind Ayr's continuing pitches.
Climo has successfully completed his test, as had been done almost from the start of the game renewal, after Kyle Rowe arrested David Armstrong's attempt at the corner of the pitch and prevented the country's striker Gregor Henry from holding a fifth round of the game.
Still Game star appears to be ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to move into the accommodation and catering sector after it became apparent that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writes and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the show, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
Officially, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the fact, although Scottish Sun sources said Kieran was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "bad restaurant business."
"We own the sea": Bolivia incarcerated on land hopes that the court will reopen the way to the ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters of La Passe.
There is a flag of ocean sand floating on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with a motto: “We are legally dependent on the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, a prisoner on land still lives memories of the access to the ocean, which Chile had to sacrifice in the bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century – alive and long to rejoice once again in the Pacific Ocean.
The hopes that have been cherished in recent decades have now been greatly strengthened, as Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes to achieve positive results,” Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians across the country will observe the announcement of the ICC decision on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will make a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s state access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian Indian president awaiting a controversial election fight for re-election, is also very interested in what Monday's decision will conclude.
"We are very close to the possibility of returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to think that it is unlikely that the court will make a favourable decision for Bolivia, even if it did, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to designate Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ICC decision will be announced only six months after the latest arguments were heard hardly indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert in Chile’s international law.
And even if Bolivia has managed to push something forward, the last four years have been able to turn it back.
“This question of access to the sea was raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that any remains of Chile’s goodwill were destroyed by the vengeful rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile have at some point extended the conversation, but after all this will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the view that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and end the 139-year-long disagreements for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, using the question of the sea as political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never compromise the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Deciding is an opportunity to see that we have to reconcile with the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Is Possible Only If It Can Trust The U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never give up their first nuclear weapons if they can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises, which the leaders of rival countries agreed during a meeting in Singapore.
His remarks were made at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be planning to renew the stuck nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the “military dream” is that if the sanctions continue and the U.S. refuses the declaration on the end of the Korean War, North Korea could ever be parked.
Washington avoids approving the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take convincing disarmament actions.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is not serious about giving up the arsenal, which the country seems to see as the only guarantor of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they will quickly conquer the nearest fashion stores
If you want to complement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentric headbands in their spring and summer collections in 2019, and he simply captivated Paris Fashion Week viewers with his style.
These particularly impractical hats won the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
Valentino’s outstanding work was a huge body-colored hat, decorated with a wide, spring-like edge, enveloping the head of the doll.
Other non-standard-sized accessories were jeweled strawberries, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple – but they’re not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks to Helovin at the same time.
Many of the colorful masks were lip-bonded and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the works looked like a naro suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other looked like a melted ice attire.
And if you’re looking at this huge fashion trend, you won’t ask.
Style experts predict that these huge covers can be accessed in the stores.
Huge hats have become popular with the La Bomba high heels, the northern hats with two-legged edges have already been worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand, created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge piece on the podium – a seamshell beach bag, almost the same size as a maneti.
A bag of red brick raffia, decorated with raffia wool and a white leather handle, has become the exclusive accent of Jacques' collection "La Riviera SS19" in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think next summer, huge hats and beach bags will come to the stores, because the designer made such a big impact, so it would be hard to ignore the unconventional size of the pair."
John Edwards: “Paying the bills is an extremely important skill for the citizens of the world”
Scotland’s independent schools have improved academic achievement records in 2018, and once again have demonstrated outstanding exam results, which have only been further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and others in general.
With a total of more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement the intended school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are willingly chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you can talk to a man in a language he understands, he will understand your mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we can say that languages excel at the top of popularity and in independent schools are characterized by the best maintenance ratings.
In total, 68 per cent of foreign language learners received the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating during the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent received the highest A rating for those who spoke and 63 percent of those who spoke German, as well as the highest A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign language learning to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as a subject of choice, are now considered as important as core subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 per cent of all reasons for which employers had difficulty filling jobs were insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more obligatory in order for young people to be prepared for their future careers.
Since future employment opportunities will be highly dependent on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalizing world.
No matter what career a person chooses to learn a second language, in the future he will be far superior to others if he has these skills necessary for the rest of his life.
By having the ability to communicate directly with people from abroad, the person learning a few languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, and French was the only language in which the two-digit 15 percent spoke.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages taught in it.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important languages for the UK in view of the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from at an independent school with training staff and specialists in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools are prepared to create such an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undeniable that in today's global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in the education system as well.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, diversity and outcomes for Scottish youth.
This needs to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his debut at Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans don’t have much time to wait to see LeBron James start the Los Angeles Lakers season.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in Sunday's opening season with Denver's Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you play is not clear yet.
“It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton said on Lakers’ website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that he is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
A short speech in West Virginia, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump speeches next week, including blockades in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi, according to Reuters.
With the approval of the suspension procedure for his elected Supreme Court candidate, Trump seeks to focus support in the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans face the threat of losing control of Congress in a November vote.
A few hours tonight will be Trump’s speech in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
A short speech in Wilinge, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on the following YouTube channel.
Short is likely to touch on the topic of this week's Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as it has raised a lot of tension over suspicions of sexual misconduct as the Senate voted to suspend the candidate's submission for a week before the FTB conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the upcoming November elections.
President Trump’s campaigners say the goal of the five meetings next week is to “energize volunteers and supporters in an effort to protect and expand the majority Republicans hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president is traveling to as many countries as possible because the campaign season is beginning to be very hot,” Trump said in a statement.
“The speech planned for tonight at the Wiling Wesbanco Arena should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” West Virginia’s Metro News reported.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, in a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the polls, is in the lows of the ratings.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to shove him to the top of the rankings,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Rider Cup Tournament: U.S. team is determined to enter Sunday’s unit competitions
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the four could be just what was needed during this Rider Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation of success is completely fabricated, but the players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
On whose side is success now?
“They started by six points, and now by four, so I guess we can see it as such a success,” Spieth said as he prepared for the day.
Of course, Europe takes the lead, has a four-point lead and is waiting for twelve more games.
American enthusiasm, Spieth says, has faded, and they do not lack it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each collected three points out of four.
Spieth was unbeatable from start to finish and was the perfect leader.
As the round continued, those wild victories became more and more famous, and Thomas scored two points out of two possibles in order to finish the fourth match with the equals.
His blow, which earned them a victory in this match in the 15th duo, was accompanied by similar whistles, which seemed to say that the American team's end is not yet underway.
“You just have to focus and take care of your own games,” Spiethas said.
Now each of these players remains to be played separately.
Towards a successful end, there are 18 duobots.
The only players to score more points for Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Rider Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe collected four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple to have had additional blows not only on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
That course of events and the reaction of the smiling viewers only confirms that they will be the players who will win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, in Europe’s last wave of sunshine through the National rays.
It would be nice to have them both at the same time in different datasets.
It’s too early to talk about Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webba Simpson briefly played Sergio Garcia, the eastern four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double additional blows during the first series of nine duolets pushed the Spaniards and Swedes into trouble, from which they were unable to escape.
No one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and four matches are so interesting to watch for the interaction between couples, for the tips they give and don’t give, and for the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team, so they took the lead in the final, but this fourth stage also showed that the U.S. team has a fighter’s back, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads 10:6
Europe will face off on the final day of the Rider Cup with a weight loss after Saturday's fourth leg leading against the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario, the duo continued to warm the atmosphere by winning two victories against hard-fought Tiger Woods and taking the lead for Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to save the trophies that Hazeltine lost two years ago, dominated in the morning's quarterfinals against the unsuccessful American side and finished the stage with a 3:1 result.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four weeks when it won two games but failed to overcome the point overrun
Jim Furyco's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12-piece match to keep the trophies in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row when Molinari dubbed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games of the Rider Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals, they impeccably shattered the confidence of losing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even better 5:4 result.
Woods, who had not won two games on Saturday, showed a high level of professionalism at some points, but had already lost 19 and 29 in his four games, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested at four in the morning and returned to play with partner Henrik Stanson in the four; they defeated 2–1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who finished first and third in the world rankings, with a 2–1 result.
Even on a pleasant, mildly windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe didn’t go all the way through butter.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised a cartel for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match they won a 2–1 draw against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, while in the fourth match they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3, without hitting the ball in the first two doubles.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cup, the team managed to score a four-point lead in a single match, even though half of the Furycos would have had enough equals to keep the trophies.
Although the two days were in second place, Sunday’s success from them seems to have failed.
North Korea Says It Won't Defend It One-Sidely Without Trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen their distrust of the United States and that in such circumstances the country will certainly not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant measures of goodwill” in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test base, and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear technology and weapons.
“But we have not received a similar response from the United States,” he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally defend ourselves."
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s already-heard complaints about Washington’s step-by-step approach to nuclear deterrence that North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps toward it, his statement, as if he had given up on Parychen, resigned as if he had completely rejected the idea.
Ri mentioned a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. President-North Korean leader’s meeting in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “the Korean peninsula’s demilitarization,” while Trump pledged to secure this.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to mitigate stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. is calling for nuclear disarmament first and is increasing the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by means of coercive means, even by refusing to declare the end of the war,” Ri said.
“To think that we can be impeached by sanctions is the same as to have utopian dreams for people we don’t care about.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader in the United Nations stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If the other country were South Korea on this issue of nuclear disarmament, rather than the United States, the issue of the Korean peninsula would not have been accepted.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech changed dramatically compared to last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that when "another Bad President" Trump called Kim a "missile master" in a suicide mission to target North Korea's missiles to the United States, it was not entirely clear.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward self-defense, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must be lifted until North Korea matures.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timetable for that, saying that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have said that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must be vigorously continued without any concessions until a complete definitive nuclear deterrence is carried out.”
The Security Council has voted in favour of sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to pave the way for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying all the progress was only for North Korea to announce after a few hours that it had made “gangster demands.”
North Korea, during a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures”.
According to him, Kim said the “appropriate measures” he sought are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and will move to normalize relations with Washington.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Harvard Students Learn to Relax Enough
The new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more, aiming to fight the growing masculine culture in their studios by consuming caffeine and not sleeping at night
One academic found that at the best university in the world, students often do not even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles<0xCA><0xBC> Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Brigam Sitio, a specialist in women’s hospitals, have developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I being told about it only now, the last year of study?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important habits of quality sleep help to achieve academic and sporting results, improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Department of Health Services, said the university decided to offer this course when it turned out that students were very sleep-deprived within a week.
The duration of the course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, workouts and books and learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and how important a walking sleep routine is.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the student campus with interactive pictograms, which encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke,” Professor Cheisler explained.
A culture of sleeplessness does not exist overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students have led to an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
“To ensure that he fell asleep sufficiently and qualitatively, the student’s secret weapon should be to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even while avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep switches the brain to starving mode, so students are constantly feeling comfortable.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler prepare a course when he attended one of the subjects he taught at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course accessible to the entire student campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all graduate students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler advised students to set up an alarm clock when it’s time to go to sleep, just like it’s time to go to bed, and to protect against the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and light diodes emitted by sun exposure, as they can smash out your cirque.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Men's Wrestling Disappoints Gerrard's Men
The Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Menga managed to beat the weakened Steven Gerrard's score of 1-0.
Ibrox expected to win their first away win after a 4:1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in the 18-game lead position and now the latter's team is eight points behind.
Menga beat seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers saw no way to level the score.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third, and Hibernian has only one inning left.
And the Rangers' worries don't end because the butter thing probably hit the head of lateral judge Calum Spence and injured him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed Ayr to overtake and led to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, relied on the same monk who took the point from Hearts last week, and he would have liked to see how his well-thought-out combinations brought together opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers dominated in control of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They were able to hit the second minute, when Menga handed the ball close to Allan McGregor's gate-penetrating Scott Pittman, but the guard smashed his chance by pointing the ball away from the gate.
After Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow pushed through the country.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the games was just a hope, not a belief in their game.
Within five minutes, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved the penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dropped his hand on Colombian complaints.
The Rangers only managed to hit the first hurdle twice, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibaly's blow to the head or the gentle Ovie Ejaria match.
While Livi’s 34th minute break may not have matched the game, no one will argue that they deserved it just for their efforts.
The Rangers again failed to defeat Jacobs's sluggish defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who retained the nickname and gave the Menga an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately brought fruit when the country's protector defeated Morelos, but after an impressive runaway Kelly drew the blow.
Livingston has included guests in the game as much as he liked – with long-distance Lithgowo and Halket ball transfers.
Holt's team was able to increase their overweight in the end, but McGregor bludgeoned from Jacobs' blow after Lithgow's hand from the corner.
After the move to the field, Rangers player Glenn Middleton once again appealed for the penalty after a confrontation with Jacobs at the end of the game, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger calculator
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is already 136 years ago and... that day in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The discovery, according to which a device was later created, known as the Geiger calculator.
Since then, this device has become a hit in the world of science, and later a hit in popular culture, when in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado the cowboys were played by scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you turn on these headsets, you can actually hear how the atoms work, touching the radioactive effect in the minerals."
Evans: “No, it’s really shooting now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that got its name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to Look Like Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to Look Like Bad Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Bad Cells – This Is Part of the Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
The cells can then “see” the proteins that are characteristic of many forms of cancer, and are then injected back
The test vaccine has given many promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
For one woman treated with this vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their exchange in the laboratory, then the cells can see the proteins characteristic of HER2 type cancer, and be injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells are extracted from patients and are learned to adapt to cancer cells, has been successfully used in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye<0xCA><0xBC> West released a tyrant supporting the Short, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance in the SNL show.
Well, it's not over.
After the unscrupulous appearance of Saturday Night Live, viewers shamed Kanye West, who praised U.S. President Donald Trump; he claimed to participate in the 2020 campaign.
That evening, after performing the third song "Ghost Town", during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", continued to insult the Democrats and voiced support for Trump.
“How many times have I talked to white people, they said, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
Well, if racism were bothering me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he explained.
The SNL show began with a comedic scene in which Matt Damon dismissed Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
While it wasn’t broadcast, West’s filmed material was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to get out of West with this record.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had trouble with his head covering.
“They were shoving me in the back.
He said not to go there with such a hat.
They sneered at me!
They said I got to the bottom," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> said he to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see what the bottom is? <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> He asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> I’m taking my superman’s hat and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to love.”
His remarks at least twice caused disapproval in the audience, and SNL broadcasters seemed embarrassed, as reported by Variety. One man told the media: "The whole studio was lethal silence."
West was invited to urgently replace singer Arian Grande after her ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West was impressed with his performance of the song "I Love It" by wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "One of the bravest spirits of man: YOU ARE FOR A RESPONSIBLE MINI."
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was “just himself and that’s incredibly amazing.”
“But I choose to KEEP a person (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his ‘art’), whose beliefs are a toxic ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now formally known as Kanye West.
He's not the first developer to change his name, but he's on the same path that Diddy has already followed, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dog was originally called Snoop Lion; music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.
Accused of committing suicide by knife at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of committing suicide when a man was wounded with a knife on Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Balihakamore.
The defendant is expected to stand trial before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Next Harington’s ‘Student Wars’ Star Criticizes Perversion of Masculinity
Another Harington was famous as a sword-smiling character, John Snow, in the HBO fantasy adventure series about the Middle Ages, The Star Wars.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the hero of the match. He argues that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, The Other said that he thought “something is wrong” and raised the question of how to combat the distorted masculinity problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Another, who recently married 31-year-old fellow Star Wars star Rose Leslie, admitted that the subject "strongly touches him".
“I feel that now this topic touches me strongly. Where did we make the mistake of developing masculinity?” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> he asked.
“What do we teach grown men to face such problems?”
Another believes that partly because of this distorted wave of masculinity, television could be responsible, because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that this type of masculinity must be distinguished?
I think this is one of the important questions of our time – how can we change it?
“We’ve made a mistake somewhere with the kids.”
In the interview, he also confirmed that he would not participate in any of the "State Wars" antagonists or sequels when the series ends next summer, and said that "he already has enough battlefields and horses".
From November the next film will be Sam Shepard's "True West" in a modern version. It is a film about the film director and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him when he created the “Wars of the Arms” – there he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife in this series, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life,” he said.
The Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Rose played Game, the love object of another character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on a property belonging to Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases of the disease
China reports that the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, and this is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spreads rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said during a conference in the province of Juno.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an opus issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized back in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because conservative values predominate in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men are ultimately led by women.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to improper protective measures during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies workers leaking Republican senator data, denies "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied suspicions that one of her employees had posted personal information from three U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats believed the allegations were made by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
“Lying, lying, and once again lying,” Waters said on his Twitter account.
It is reported that the information revealed included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrino Hatcho, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, announced by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at a time when allegations of sexual misconduct were being investigated in the Senate against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leaked information came a little later when the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
“Conservatory websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of these records was related to the Waters office and information from a Waters employee was disclosed,” the Capitol reported.
"These unjustified suspicions are completely false and absolute lies," Waters said in a statement.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these false and false suspicions, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
These unjustified suspicions are completely untrue and absolute lies.”
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism online, as well as from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“She says she doesn’t have enough reputation to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of doing things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not defend.
He should not doubt the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and humble.”
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who participated in the mid-term election campaign to replace Waters, also commented on his Twitter account.
“True, if not a lie,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these erroneous allegations.
“We will make sure that the organizers are clear,” she continued, “that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all without exception to my employees.”
Review of the comedy "Johnny English Hits Again" – a breathtaking spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for "Brexit" quotes in any British film. The same seems to be said about the revival of the action spy comedy franchise "Johnny Inglisham" – "Johnny Inglisham" in Inglisham's Inglisham". It was launched in 2003 and in 2011.
Will this sarcastic autosaturation of how we have obviously moved forward become a new possibility for national exports?
Incompetent John English, with his wide-eyed and gum-face, has a second chance to bring to the surface unpleasant truths <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> the name itself clearly indicates that this comedy is intended for non-English-speaking cinematic regions.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, while claiming luxury, has acquired some of the characteristics of Inspector Clouseau, some of Mr. Byn's traits and a sleek resemblance to that guy, recalls the dramedy used for the theme of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also a somewhat grounded character about a traveler and a mysterious man who caused the chaos Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
In this newest John England film, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked it when John English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armour, and the men's rotor slammed into his helmet.
Atkinson’s comedic talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems exhilarating and strangely exaggerated, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible bravely incorporate elements of comedy.
Humor is as if it were more intended for children than adults, and the adventures of John English, which I did not believe, do not seem as inventive and peaceful as Atkinson’s silent jokes of playing Mr. Byne.
At present, the most common theme is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-intruder successfully hacked into Britain’s highly secretive spy network and revealed the identities of all the British spies in the area, causing the agent’s anger – too insignificant for Kevin Eldon’s role.
It’s the last drop in the Prime Minister’s cup of a pompous, corner-picked character who’s already suffering from shocking political unpopularity: The character portraying Teresa May squeezes out everything she can, but in the scenario there’s no good material for it.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have retired.
This means that you'll have to turn to John English himself, who's currently working as the school's director at some elaborate institution, but who's giving illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. Here were a few good jokes from the academy when the Englishman offered "Shup of Rock."
The Englishman is sent back to Vaithol to discuss the emergency situation and there meets for a long time his common Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man related to the captain of a submarine, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high school girl, seems to be underutilized.
So Batman and Robin, able to intercept all matters in the secret service of Her Majesty, take action again and meet Olga Kurylenko played by the fatal handsome Opelija Buletova.
A charismatic billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problem, including the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, is threatening the prime minister.
Inglish and Bough begin their odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause chaos on a luxury Voltos yacht, and Inglish begins complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headsets to get to know Volt.
All the stopwatches were clearly reserved for this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild it is, it all reminiscent of children's television.
It's pretty mediocre.
As with other John England films, I couldn’t get rid of the thought: the unfortunate British film industry is unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
The Labour Party denies drawing up a plan for the British for working four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay a salary of five days.
It is reported that the party wants corporate leaders to share the savings accrued due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving its employees one free day.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and bring home the same amount of salary.
The source says the idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country’s development in a favourable direction.
The transition to a four-day week was also welcomed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to take advantage of the benefits of a changing economy for workers.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “A review of the policy is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is in line with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is currently not supported by the entire Leiborist Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnell at last week's Labour Party conference took the opportunity to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless dictators” and “earning hunters” in utilities.
Such shadow chancellor plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back, because, having noticed the wrongdoing, the Labour government may deduct something.
It also approved plans to include employees in the company’s board of directors and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10 percent of private sector company capital to employees, and they could receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the 60 Minutes question, whether the FTB investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion
When the FTB conducts an investigation into allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a final vote has been postponed for at least a week, whether or not to refer him to the Supreme Court, the question arises whether the facts explained by the Bureau of Investigation could affect any Republican senator in this regard.
Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FTB would find out something that would change their mind.
Right, Senator J. Kennedy's taking a more liberal approach than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” answered Mr. Kennedy.
“As I said at the hearing, I spoke with Judge B. Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these accusations arose, I called him and asked, “Did you do that?”
He replied resolutely, firmly, unequivocally.”
So Mr Graham’s views do not seem to change anything.
“When I’ve made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, there should be some really disturbing accusations,” he said.
“For Dr. Ford, I don’t know who was there, but I know one thing: Brett is categorically negative,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Nobody can confirm what they’re saying.
Thirty-six years have passed.
I don’t think there will be anything new.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it contributed to poverty alleviation?
This Saturday, the World Citizens’ Festival will take place in New York City – an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars and aiming at at least an impressive goal – to eradicate poverty in the world.
For seven years now, the World Citizens’ Festival will be held on the Great Square of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the message of the true purpose of the event more widely.
The World Citizens’ Festival was launched in 2012 as a follow-up to the World Anti-Poverty Project, an international mediation group that aims to eradicate poverty as the number of people actively fighting it increases.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to inform the world’s leader about the purpose of the event.
But are the citizens of the world successfully achieving this goal? There are 12 years left until the deadline.
Will the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Perhaps this is just another example of so-called clickivism, fictitious activism – people think that it will really change the position of a “poster” who has signed an online petition or a letter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens’ Festival, the movement has recorded more than 19 million actions by its sponsors since 2011, which promotes the achievement of many different goals.
They claim that, under the pressure of these actions, the world’s leaders have announced commitments and policy strategies worth $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group identified 390 commitments and statements induced by the group’s actions, of which at least US$10 billion has already been paid or raised.
According to the group’s calculations, the secured funds have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the issue of “The Power of Nutrition” – a non-investor/executive partnership in the United Kingdom that aims to “help children grow up in the world and uncover all of their potential in the world.”
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments of countries and such as you, citizens of the world, we can achieve that such social injustice as food inadequacy will be a thing of the past,” Tracey Uland, an ambassador for the Mythical Powers, told a news conference in London in 2018.
The group also stated that, after receiving 5,000 appeals calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Mythical Power project, which will reach 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In replying to one of the DUK’s questions on its website, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”,
The citizens of the world say: “It’s a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and fail.
But like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the performers who are participating in this year’s event in New York. The event is hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Home Secretary says U.S. could use naval blockades to impede Russian energy exports
“If necessary, Washington can use a navy to block Russian energy from reaching markets as well as markets in the Middle East,” U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think that Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
“The United States can do that by using a navy, can make sure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, can carry out a blockade, can make sure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke told the attendees at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's methods with those used to deal with issues relating to Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser balance that would replace fuel,” he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements turned out to the Trump administration as part of a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia on the market, offering Europe’s consumers a much cheaper option.
Therefore, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the incorrect Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a prisoner in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, the reason for Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is only economic, it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position received an anti-German reaction, it reaffirmed its determination to continue this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I certainly do not support third-country interference in our energy supply affairs," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president in the 2020 presidential election.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was seriously considering the issue of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in the Hollow City Council, Massachusetts, Mr Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to run our fallen government, they have to go to the top post,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election.”
During a meeting in the city hall, Warren beat President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about how Donald Trump treats our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his proposed candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said that “there is no doubt that a FTB investigation is necessary before the vote.”
But a poll released on Thursday shows that most voters in Warren’s state themselves believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by Safolk University’s political research center and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not participate in the election.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Dewal Patrick – 38 percent support his possible candidacy and 48 percent oppose it.
The other candidates for the 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and former Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says the official decision will be made in January, according to the Associated Press.
Donald Trump's Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder
26-year-old Track Palin, who joined the military in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after the incident in the family violence, he was arrested and charged.
“I see what my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back to his everyday life, so I understand other families who are feeling the effects of the traumatic disorder, and some of the injuries of our soldiers, with which they come back to Trump,” she said.
Palin called his arrest an avoidable truth. She said that her son and other military veterans "return a little changed, they return with a firmer heart, they return doubting whether there will be any respect for what they are doing."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault against women, as well as allegations of obstruction of reporting domestic violence with a gun and in the presence of a mob, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasila Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support Resistance to New Asylum Seekers Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
In Washington on Friday, representatives of 18 states and the county made remarks by amicus curiae (a court consultant) to support a dispute over asylum seekers’ policies, reports NBC News.
All the plaintiffs' names in the Grace v. Sessions trial, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal politics, are not disclosed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" raped her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s state lawyers have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives a lot of asylum requests, as states are burdened by the problems of ongoing gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the Immigration Appeals Board’s 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is not respecting the state, federal and international laws that have been in force for decades".
“Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be made taking into account the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and this prohibition violates this principle,” the note reads.
In this note, lawyers also argue that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and “provide the necessary job services.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told judges on immigration issues not to provide asylum to those fleeing domestic violence and victims of gang violence.
“Refugee is granted to those who leave their country of residence because of persecution or fears related to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or to certain political views,” Sessions said in a political statement on June 11.
The asylum provided has never been aimed at solving all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face on a daily basis all over the world.
Doubling the number of victims in Palu, desperately searching for the remaining survivors
The situation of the remaining survivors is constantly deteriorating.
“The tension is very high,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, reassuring her hot baby son in the evacuation center of the city of Palu.
“Greens don’t stop carrying more and more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.”
It has been observed that residents return to their ruined homes, collect heavy-duty items, try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5 earthquake hospitals have been damaged.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Harry, who had suffered back and shoulder fractures, were discharged outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated in the field.
His eyes swollen with tears as he recounts how in the hotel's fifth-floor room, where he was staying with his wife and daughter, he felt a sharp earthquake.
“There was no time to save others.
They show me I'm going through the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend the wedding.
“I heard the wife’s cry for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they are healthy.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Fearing Propaganda
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A week ago, when the official Chinese newspaper circulated a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, concealing the mutual benefits of U.S. and Chinese trade, U.S. ambassadors in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited an appendix to the state-run "Des Moines Register" paid by the China Daily and accused China of influencing the U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
“Trump’s allegation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new stage in a reinforcing Washington campaign aimed at putting pressure on China,” U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to disseminate advertising to stimulate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensifying trade war, and both countries are collapsing in tariffs on each other’s imports of goods.
According to Chinese and US experts, the Chinese response tariffs were applied to exporters from Iowa and similar countries who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former longtime governor of Iowa and one of the major agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said that China “is increasingly reluctant to print propaganda advertisements in our free press,” according to the report.
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the respectable freedom of speech and the press in America and ordered a paid advertising message to the Des Moines Register,” wrote Brunstad.
“In the meantime, at the local Beijing press station, you won’t find each other’s opposing voices and you won’t create a real video that reflects the differences that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, because the press is under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad also added that “one of China’s most famous newspapers came out of the offer to print” his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: As midterm elections approach, Kavanaugh’s fiasco deterred Republican voter
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has even been accused of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that it will be a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, particularly in the polls.
The situation is elicited by extremely strong emotions, and many Republicans already officially say they want to vote.
Such things cannot be withdrawn later," Grant Reeher, a professor at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill newspaper in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute calls to start an FTB investigation would be enough to reassure bad voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday — they will remember it tomorrow and November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor to the progressive watch group MoveOn, and national representative.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted: “November is approaching!” during a demonstration in the Senate lobby when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, the zip reported to Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will flow across the country,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst, told the news site.
“People say she was so strong already, and they’re right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs and voters under the age of 18-29 who, although disliked the president, often simply do not vote."
Even before Mr. Ford made public statements, when she detailed allegations of sexual harassment against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that if Republicans approve the candidacy, it could lead to anger.
“This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote, it’s not just whether Kavanaugh will be appointed a judge, it’s also a question of how the Republicans handled the situation and how they dealt with Mr Ford,” Guy Cecilia told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to expect after Mr Kavanaugh’s and Mr Ford’s testimony, although it is getting a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe fully or probably in Mr. Ford’s statements, and 35 percent say fully or probably in Mr. Kavanaugh’s statements.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Mr Kavanaugh was indeed or likely to have lied to by giving evidence, and only 30 percent said the same thing about Mr Ford.
At the request of Mr. Flake, the FTB is currently investigating the allegations made by Mr. Ford and the testimony of at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Mr. Ford, who was sworn in, testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, claiming that Mr. Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at a party where they attended while studying at the University of Jelly at 9am.
The creator of the web is planning to establish a new internet to resist Google and Facebook.
World network inventor Tim Berners-Lee is creating a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor, Inrupt, is a company whose work is based on the open-source platform Solid by Bernerso-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as what information they have access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to take over the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the starter.
This is a historic moment.”
The app, which is based on Solid technology, allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD).

The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and what information can access.
The company calls this the empowerment of the person through the data.
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes, and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can develop their own decentralized apps using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not consult with Facebook or Google about changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a statement released on Saturday by Media, Berners-Lee said Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the sustainability and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet at Massachusetts University of Technology with the founding of the Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on internet neutrality.
Even while working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I feel a lot of optimism about this new era of the internet,” added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Baden – First World War Victory Crusade Awarded Priest
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his birth in his hometown, the only Anglican Church clergyman honored with the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vannes won the award during the attack of Belenglis and Lucknow on September 29, 1918.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastors shot a sniper, so he remained unaware that he was awarded the award of the highest level British army.
During the parade, two grandsons covered the stone of memory in Ra<0xC5><0xA1>dena, Northamptonshire.
One of the granddaughters, Michael Vannes, said that the fact that the stone had been covered just 100 years after the grandson’s award was awarded is “exquisitely symbolic”.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant led his battalion through the St. Kent Canal "by boiling very molten smoke, by greatly spreading the fires of the subsidiaries and automatics."
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and “particularly galaly” led the line forward, and then one attacked the subway and killed three crew members.
Lieutenant-Colonel B. Vanne was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vannes said his grandfather's actions were "somewhat unparalleled, but at the same time extremely inspiring."
After a parade led by Brentwood's Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vann helped the wreath.
Michael Vann said he was honored to participate in the parade and added: "The support of a true hero is shown by the support that many people will give."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to see the Bellator 206, but had to meet the Snow Pepa
Imagine: you don’t go to sleep all night to see the dry-skinned Bellator 206, but you can’t see the main vision in the end.
There were 13 fights in the San Jose poster, six of which were on the main card and were broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, Gegarde Moussai and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a fight, and British viewers were shocked by the stoppage of the film "Snow Pepa".
Some spectators, to put it mildly, were not impressed, because it was because of this struggle that they did not sleep until the Parish.
In a tweet, one of the sergeants called the change of the broadcast a children's animated film "someone sick joke."
“According to the rules set by the government, at 6 a.m., such content was inappropriate, so the program for children had to be turned on,” said Dave Schwarz, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at Bellator.
"Yes, "Sweet Pepper."
Bellator President Scott Cocker said he would try to adjust the schedules in the future in the light of viewers in the UK.
“When I think about repetition, it seems to me that maybe we can do it,” Cocker said.
“But it’s 6 o’clock in the morning, Sunday, and we wouldn’t be able to resolve it until Sunday at our own time – Monday at their time.
However, we are already working on this issue.
Trust me, after changing the broadcast, you exchanged a lot of messages that weren’t all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it’s a question of government.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give more to the passionate, but just failed.
This is a unsuccessful situation.”
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Daley Feels Insecure About His Sexual Orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
Twenty-four athletes claimed only in primary school realized that they were not the same as everyone else.
For the first time, Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, claimed to have spoken publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that when he became a father, it was not so important to win the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the permanent head of this long-running broadcast, has been out of work for several months due to illness.
At the first L. Laverne funeral, which guests are asked to imagine traveling to an uninhabited island, Daley said growing up feeling inferior because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: “Until these days, that sense of modesty and kinship has been driven by the forces that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that it was worth it so as not to disappoint the surroundings when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals has become a high-level LGBT activist and, by participating in this year’s Commonwealth Games, has taken the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He claimed to have spoken about it in public, because he believes that he was lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others such hope.
Three times, the world champion claimed that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was unexpected.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never caused any problems.
According to T. Delay, when he was so young in his first Olympics he was only 14, and three years later his father died of cancer, it is difficult to meet someone who would be of the same age, but experienced the same heights and lows.
When the couple became the parents of Robert Ray Blacko-Daley's son in June, Daley's perspective, he said, changed completely.
“If you had asked last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal.
His son's name is the same as his grandfather Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto T. Daley, whose father did not want to reconcile with death, so one of his last questions was whether tickets for the 2012 London Olympics had already been purchased, which he was going to watch sitting in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” Daley said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” Daley said.
A year later, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that I’ve dreamt about it all my life – to jump into the water watching local spectators at the Olympics – there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of the first song for the wires – Heather Small’s “Proud”, which inspired his feelings as the Olympians prepare and still happily shakes the skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 p.m. British Summer Time.
Form-loser Ph. Mickelson missed Saturday's Rider Cup tournament on the bench
American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Sunday as he has been to the Rider Tournament 47 times, but he will need to improve his form so that it doesn’t become a failure.
Dr. Mickelson, who has already played for the 12th time in the two-year races, was defeated by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday’s fourth game on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, the main winner spent five times a day on the support team, while the rest improved his technique on the pitch to correct the game's obstructive errors.
Even at a career high, the 48-year-old is not the ideal player to play on Le Gold National’s rugged pitches, with a long line of turbulent grass that is extremely unfavourable for inaccurate blows.
In addition, as if the pitch itself would not be scary enough, in the ninth match to be played on Sunday, Dr. Mickelson is playing against British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who, along with new Tommy Fleetwood, will win all four of these games.
If four-pointers are able to make a good start to the upcoming 12-point match, Dr. Mickelson’s game can become absolutely decisive.
Furykas expressed confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't speak otherwise.
“He fully understood his role today, stretched his hand over my back, and he said he was ready to play even tomorrow,” Furyk said.
There is no lack of self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t know he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went like this, so we decided that we would do it.
He wants to play, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Dr. Mickelson will improve Nick Fald’s record and become the most-played athlete in the Rider Cup.
This may mark the end of his Rider Cup career, as well as the unparalleled heights of his personal record.
Dr. Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven levels, but Furyk says his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, conscientious, he likes to laugh at people and he’s a great guy with whom it’s fun to be in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week as well, it was good to watch it.
It’s a lot more than a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large overweight can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great deal of overtime as the riders approach the last race of the Ryder Cup units can easily turn into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in 1997 in Valdera, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but only crossed the finish line with a barely leading result of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“We constantly remind ourselves that in Valdera we had a great victory; we had a great victory in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valdera, where we won, but just barely,” Bjorn (pictured), who observed the 2018 Golf victory with a 5:3 and a 10th Friday.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow we will need all our strength.
Go ahead and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, then the game is not finished.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we have to pursue it consistently.
“I’ve always said I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the challenging pitch, Bjorn added: “I would not want to run behind my own eyes in any way.
Tomorrow is going to be a completely different haircut.
Tomorrow is going to be an individual game, that’s different.
Great to play with your partner when everything is going well, but when you are on the pitch alone, testing your ability to play golf limits.
This idea needs to be installed for the players – tomorrow you will have to squeeze everything out of yourself.
Now he will have to break up with his partner, and he will have to squeeze everything out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyck hopes his players will perform better individually than as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury himself experienced both sides of the surprises of the last day, as Bruklaine was on the winning team until Europe performed the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers."
“I remember every damned word,” he said, when asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players in preparation for the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but look for a quick start – the one you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the midfielder becomes very tense.
We have formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that we, you know, are trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas will have the task of trying to lead a responsible fight and meet Rory McIlroy in the top-level match, with Europeans led by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“I chose these guys in this order because I think they’re going to successfully beat the whole game,” Bjorn said of his choice for the unit matches.
The delivery of a new German warship has been postponed.
The latest German navy frigate was expected to start operations back in 2014 and replace the warships during the Cold War, but, according to local media, we will not see them until at least next year due to the ever-increasing systems and the extremely high prices.
According to the military representative, quoted by the newspaper Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was overshadowed by the problems the ship had already delivered.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the navy back in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are believed to be equipped with a powerful substation, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and certain secrecy technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, allowing the latest frigates to sail far from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to the endless delays, the most advanced technology warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories after they are put into use.
The failed F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship that has already been delivered to the shipbuilder.
Little is known about the cause of the return, but the German press mentions a number of essential software and hardware defects that would have caused the ship to have been trusted in the military mission.
The shortcomings of the software are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is too heavy – this reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to implement various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the entire project – along with the technical equipment, including the training of the crew – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion).
The latest frigate-fighting problems have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the navy was "in fact lacking in suitable vessels".
The official said that over a period of time the problems had been encountered, as the old ships had already been decommissioned, but there was no way to change them.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Whales
A new study conducted in a Scottish high-altitude mansion aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new knowledge about the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will look at ticks, soprano ticks, brown earrings, and the water’s finest in the gardens of Vester Roso Inverevo.
In certain areas of the territory, special recorders will be deployed to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An expert analysis of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of the signals emitted by the wing and the activity of one or the other type.
A map and a report of residential areas will then be created, helping to form a detailed picture of the behavior across the entire landscape.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) Nature Adviser Rob Dewars expects the results to reveal which habitats are most important for wetlands and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential area surveillance work, such as the creation of pastures, as well as to find out how best to maintain forested areas so that they are suitable for meadows and other related species.
Over the past century, the population of smallpox has declined in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by the construction and development of real estate, which affect the waste and the destruction of residential areas.
The threat is also posed by wind turbines and lightning, as is the case with moss, some chemicals used to treat building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
The squirrels aren’t really blind.
However, catching prey during night hunting helps the ears more than the eyes.
Insects can accurately determine the location of insects or obstacles in the flight path by means of a suitable echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, looks to the skyscrapers extremely responsibly.
There are ten trained experts working here, who regularly carry out investigations, check-ups, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only reserve specifically for bats in the Threave manor in Damfries and Galway, home to eight out of ten Scottish bat species.
Superintendent of the manor, David Thompson, says the manor’s territory is ideal for them.
“Threave Manor is a great place for batsmen,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas to live in.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is crucial to check the absence of bats before the start of the area's surveillance work, as accidental destruction of one bat could result in the death of up to 400 females and young children, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Whales are protected and prohibited from killing, annoying or disturbing, as well as prohibited from destroying their prey.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Whale Protection Foundation, called on the public to contribute to the rescue of the Whales.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t know how many of the local species are affected.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges – lawyers plan to sue German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo called his accusations of raping him "a liar" and said that people, using his name, "want to be famous."
His lawyers have prepared the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has issued the accusations, to sue.
In 2009, a Portuguese and Juventus club striker was charged with raping American Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he had then reportedly paid the woman $375,000 to delay the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers live on an Instagram video hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticised the reports and called them “learners.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
“What they’re saying today is a lie,” the Ballon d’Or winner said five times as he stared at the camera.
They want to be famous in my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name – that’s part of my job.
I’m a happy person, everything is fine,” added the athlete, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on charges they have called “unacceptable publicity of suspicions of things going on in private space.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the athlete would seek compensation for "moral damages that would amount to the seriousness of this violation - perhaps one of the most serious violations of a person's rights over the past few years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at the Palms Casino and Hotel Apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents handed over to the Nevada Clark County Courthouse, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room after a meeting at the nightclub, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo attacked the road and told her that he was a “99 percent good man” who was betrayed by the remaining “one percent” of his personality.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sex, but claimed they had been contracted.
Mayorga also said she had contacted police and her injuries in the hospital were photographed, but later agreed to agree to a non-judicial settlement because she was "afraid of retaliatory action" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the deal because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was sent from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer, signing a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract, he joined the Italian giant Juventus.
"Brexit". The UK would regret the lost car makers forever
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the United Kingdom would “forever regret” if it lost its status as the world’s leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He added with concern about a statement by the UK's Toyota division to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily suspended at the Burnastone plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that a breakthrough at the border would result in a no-deal Brexit resulting in a job loss.
The Burnastone plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production,” said Burnastone CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also voiced concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and its consequences for international trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory after Brexit for the month.
According to automakers, the most worrying are the threats that will arise to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates when needed, as parts for custom-made cars are delivered from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border; according to these industry companies, this may result in delays in the delivery of details or lack thereof.
Toyota said it would not be able to store more than one day of the necessary supplies at the Derbyshire plant, so production would stop.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “prepared precisely to avoid such border checks.”
“We want to have the best deal, which, as I say, would not only allow us to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also data from other car manufacturers show that it is essential to continue to use a highly successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say for what time the production would be stopped, but warned that looking at the long-term, additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvall, who worked at the Burnastone factory for 24 years and was responsible for Unite trade union meetings, said his trade union members were increasingly concerned: “I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.”
The government's representative said: "We have proposed an ambitious and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
“Continuing the fight for a candidate for the Supreme Court, Donald Trump’s crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week,” the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, the latter investigating Russia’s interference in the elections, the ties of Trump’s aides to Russia, and the possible interference with justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a source of controversy in Washington for months.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of using the 25th amendment to remove the president.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
However, in the wake of reports of resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
The meeting was later postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting where both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, the FTB called for a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations, delaying the vote in a plenary session.
A spokeswoman for Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “His date is not fixed. It can happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it can be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report the news to the press."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: since September 10, Sanders has not hosted a single press conference at the White House.
Leader Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders responded that press conferences rarely take place not because he doesn't like "effect-seeking" TV journalists. True, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they're looking for effects for viewers."
At the time, he noted that Trump was more often associated with the press directly.
“The president answers the questions more often than any previous president,” she said, adding, “We’ve reviewed this statistic without any evidence.”
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen that this has happened many times in the last few weeks, and the press conference will change your direct communication with the President of the United States."
Mr. Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House, attends public meetings or press conferences with honourable guests.
One-person press conferences are rarely held.
The free and sometimes bizarre presidential appearance in front of journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
Scottish Health Minister Writes to NST Workers from the EU on Brexit Concerns
Scotland's health minister wrote a letter to workers from the EU expressing the country's gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens who work in the public service sector entrusted to it.
Mr Freeman said in a letter: “In the summer, the UK and EU withdrawal negotiations continued and are approaching the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government started to prepare faster and a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very worried now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all employees – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health care system to the benefit of our patients and communities.
Scotland is truly your home and we very much want you to stay here.”
Abercrombie's head injury patient underwent emergency surgery
The Vanderbilt Commodores lost the race to Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie at 31:27, an emergency operation was performed on Saturday, Tennessee journalist Mike Organa said.
Tennessee State head coach Rhodes Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
“He came up to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and doctors at the sidelines of Abercrombie gave oxygen to breathe, later leaned on the napkins and sent for further investigations.
Tennessee State Officer Chris Harris of the Tennessee WSMV said the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type and extent of the injury," and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Officially passing the sporting season, the second-run Abercrombie has moved from Illinois and is playing the first season for the Tennessee State team.
Before leaving the match, he recovered five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he recovered during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher incremental tax
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher mark-up fee, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This step will reduce the risk posed by the successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
A substantial tax will be levied on non-taxable persons in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, and will allocate them to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that UK real estate buyers are going to be taxed at a higher tariff, while receiving additional money to help the homeless.
By promising to provide more affordable housing and applying to high-income people, it is believed that this step will reduce the risk posed by the successful Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
A substantial increase in taxation will be imposed on taxable individuals and businesses in the UK, and the extra money will be used by the government to promote the campaign against homelessness.
An additional fee – paid in addition to the current mark-up fee, including higher rates introduced two years ago for buyers of second houses or rentals – can reach up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects this step to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK residents, which leads to a rise in prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, which is why many wealthy countries and especially the capital districts have become ghost cities.
The new strategy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a significant tax cut to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land but not using it, supporting large real estate prices, and urged May to address the embarrassment of Britain's housing supply by waiving affordable housing quotas.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching housing reforms, including rental price controls and a no-fault disembarkation ban.
In addition, it wants more power to build new houses to provide municipal councils.
May said: “Last year I said that when I was in office as prime minister, I would try to bring back the British dream that every new generation should have a better life.
This means that we need to fix our disrupted housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is incorrect that non-residents in the UK and companies established abroad can buy a home as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of having a home has become almost unrealistic, and the threat of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to ever become Scotland's national team leader.
The 42-year-old loves the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first league and three points behind the first-placed club.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the B team and that's it," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportsound.
“But when I was a kid, I grew up at Hamden Stadium with my father watching a lot of Scottish national team games, and it always made me want to come back.
“This will only happen if I manage the club with success.
The Red "Sunderland" was led by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Having previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's offers, the former Alloa Athletic manager says she didn't feel any anxiety starting to work after such well-known managers at such a large club.
“Now my success will be judged by the answer to the question ‘Can I return this club to the Premier League?’
According to the structure and conditions, this club is undoubtedly a Premier League club,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to bring him back, but maybe just after the club is back, I’ll think I’ve worked successfully here.”
Rosso's managerial career lasted only three years before he worked as an assistant manager at Dumbarton Club and replaced Hearts' coach for 15 months.
He later helped to recover from the fall of the third division of the Alloa, and St Mirren club, which was threatened to fall, became the winners of the championship the following season.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than he has ever felt in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This change must have been radical,” he recalls from the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that leadership was more appropriate for me than playing.
That sounds strange, because I followed, I made a lot of money, and I was happy with the happy achievements.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to deal with a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – work stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and I’m doing it now. When I grew up, I always felt like I was in my own horn, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction.”

Research has shown that the best time to drink beer is on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the income of Britain’s poor aubergines, but has made it even more difficult for restaurant chains to cope with.
The figures revealed that sales of alloys and bars groups rose 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consulting firm with the following data, told CGA: “Unfinishedly sunny and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July continued a similar trend as in June, when the percentage of alloys’ revenues rose by 2 percent.
In June, trade in restaurants decreased by 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The main earnings from the trade in beverages were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew more strongly than in restaurants.
While not as strong as restaurant businesses, the solar eclipse also affected the main revenues from the food trade.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
“Food sales in well-managed liquor stores and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, from the RSM Leisure and Diversity Sector Analysis Company, said: “These results continue the visible trend since the end of April.
With regard to catering establishments, the main factors continue to be the impact of the weather and the most important social and sporting events.
So it is no wonder that restaurant groups continue to suffer. True, a drop in sales of 4.8 percent in more than one year will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the steady pressure on costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for most food-trading companies, and the weather will show whether the milder temperatures in August will give the atmosphere that is needed."
Total sales growth in stores and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the growth of branded networks.

One in Five Children Have Social Media Accounts Hidden From Parents <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The study found that one in five children – some just 11 years old – have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that more and more fake Insta pages were being published.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students say they have a basic account to show to parents.
One in five children – some only 11 years old – create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram pages, a link to Instagram’s photo-sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the students said they use a censored primary account to show parents, but they also have hidden accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret website for her thirteen-year-old daughter, learned that the teenager was insistently offering: “Extort me.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students had two accounts, and half of those students admitted that they were hiding accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the MDK, said: “The fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where they cannot be found by parents and teachers is a cause for concern.”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
At the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body of the Scottish Sports Council, Eilidha Doyle was elected as its Director’s Consultant.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and president. Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity that allows sporting leaders to take advantage of the variety she has gained over the past decade at the international level.
“Eilidha has earned great respect across the Scottish, UK and global sports community and we are confident that its inclusion in the council will bring a lot of benefits to Scottish sports,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I really want to serve as the voice of the athletes and hope that I will truly contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The 200m and 400m match at the 1996 Atlantic Games and a total of four Olympic gold medal winners, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, was unable to walk after a short-term ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if I will heal and to what extent.
I had to work until exhaustion, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again and today I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for your encouragement!’
Breast milk advertising, in which mothers are compared to cows, received different evaluations online
The breastfeeding company received differing opinions about its advertising, in which nursing mothers are compared to dairy cows.
In order to mark the product, described as the world’s first silent wearable breast protrusion, the beginning of the trade, the technology company Elvie for consumers has released an ironic music video inspired by the image. It aims to show the image.
In this full-bodied dance, four true mothers dance according to a sound recording that says, for example, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't see any fins" and "If you haven't noticed, here's no fins, here's my breasts."
The addendum continues: "Take it out, take it out, feed it to the babies, take it out, take it out, milk my beauties."
However, an advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked an online dispute.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments, has been reacted by viewers in various ways, many of whom have said that it looks through their fingers at the fears of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product is a very poor solution.
“Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, only their newborn babies are removed from them after a few days,” one woman wrote.

Another commented: “It is understood that it traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them for advertising that delivers breast milk to mothers from whom babies are not taken away?"
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commentator’s ad was defended, with one woman admitting that the song seemed “very fun”.
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy it if I'd still feed.
When I got out of milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant", <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> wrote one.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement for mothers whose milk is extracted (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
Its purpose is not to drink or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that all of them were shocked by unnoticed milkshakes fitted with bras.
The idea of the campaign is based on the notion that many breast-feeding women claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk container does not reveal any sound, has no wires or pipes, and inconspicuously fits in the feeding bag – so women can move freely, keep babies or even leave the house when they pull out of the milk.
“Mother’s partner and executive creative director Ana Balarin commented: Elvie’s milkshakes are a revolutionary product that deserves to be marketed boldly and provocatively.
When we compared breastfeeding women to dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the cessation of milk and all the challenges it poses, while at the same time showing as much fun and as possible the incredible sense of freedom that the new dairy cows will give.
This is not the first time that Ellie’s teapot has been in the headlines.
During a fashion week in London, designer Martha Jakubowski's collection of two children demonstrated on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
Over the course of a month, the number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially, but the number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, in part because the Trump administration’s strict rhetoric and policies have made it harder to accommodate them with caregivers.
Traditionally, most of the carers themselves were immigrants without documents and feared that applying for child care risked the possibility of staying in the country.
When the federal government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and this data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased further.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress that the institution had detained several dozen people who had applied for care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Nearly 80 percent of these people – guardians or members of their families – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
According to the staff of the shelter, in order to consider the cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of detention, and not within 60 days, as was usual before.
Many will try to defend the request for legal status before the immigration judge by not coming in person, but using a conference video call.
Those who do not have the right to receive assistance will be deported quickly.
According to reports received by shelter workers and in recent months from the system, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which could lead to rape breakouts or attempts to flee.
Scouts say that even more worrying is caused in large institutions, such as the Tornillo shelter: due to the size of them, the chances of not seeing signs of a child coughing are increased.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can deepen the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria has called on the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualems also invited Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eight-year war.
Moualem, who is also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces engaged in counterterrorism pretexts on Syrian soil are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
“They have to leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem said that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus would not stop fighting this sacred fight until we have destroyed terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all areas of Syria.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said the conditions for them to return were good, and at the same time accused some Western countries of spreading an unjustified fear that deterred refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them get back,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid when Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created the conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has helped to prevent a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province that is home to three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for clear deadlines, and also expressed hope that military action would be directed at the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra-related al-Qaeda front, which will be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura expects to convene the first meetings of a committee of government and opposition members to prepare a draft Syrian post-war constitution and prepare the ground for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions under which the Syrian government will participate in the committee – the work of the group should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, and warned not to interfere.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
Under such a logic, in 2020, Trump would be elected unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, his presidency would sooner end in a blaming and scandal.
It would be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
So far, there are no signs of fatigue among viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-performing TV ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers with the best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers.
“It’s the fire that draws people because we don’t understand something,” says Neal Baer, who is producing ABC’s Descedent about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack on the Congressional House.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of “Only Fun Parts and a Few Unpleasant Truths as Secretly Entering the Hollywood Boys Club,” has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘He’s kidding me,’” Scovell said.
Chaos is worth it to have fun.
Of course, unlike the others on the show, comics coming from Washington can decide the Roe vs. Wade future, the possibility of uniting immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Invisibility is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
And yet this is more than necessary to be an informed citizen of Washington, when he realizes that for six hours a group of experts is watching him discuss how Bob Woodward uses unpublished data in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s “Stripping” and “Demonstrating the $15,000 price tag.”
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
“His actions are reminiscent of a reality show because every night he throws something out for you,” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> about Trump’s changing show characters and the daily wing of the plot (invitation to a conflict with N.F.L. or praise to General Kim Jong Unu) says.
You can't miss a series, otherwise you'll be late.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, there was 27 degrees of heat and bright sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside the tunnel and watching MSNBC while recording on CNN.
He couldn’t break up – certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the brink.
“I remember when we used to create those crazy shows, people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“I thought there was a joke here, but it turns out they were right.”

In the middle of a tense election to the House of Representatives, money from the environment is spilled
It’s no wonder that the Congressional District Reorganization, which ended in an attempt by two members of the House to win the same post, poured money into Pennsylvania’s 17th District.
The recently overrun suburban Pitsberg County has joined the fight with Democratic House Member Conor Lamb – last spring he won his seat in a special election in another county.
Lamba will compete with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, a large part of which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps crossed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that in violation of the constitution, the old counties were falsified in favor of Republicans.
During the election campaign in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DKKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCK) – were worried about the campaign’s finances.
Lambs in Pennsylvania became famous when a small majority of votes in the 18th congressional district won the widely-watched special election in March.
For more than a decade, Republicans have held this position, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Politicians have given the Democrats such an advantage so far.
U.S. Considers Sanctioning El Salvador for Supporting China, But After Sentencing
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, but have not received any negative response from Washington in the first place.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country until the partners broke up with the leadership of the Trump Organization.
"Due to the recent decisions that have been taken, officials at the Taiwan State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama," the ministry said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions are only aimed at Salvador, who in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid, as well as drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions for specific individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials deferred a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in order to prevent the move to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any deliberations on sanctions against Salvador.
“To show the importance of the administration for this meeting, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the list of speakers for the conference scheduled for mid-October,” the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without notifying Washington of any appeasement or punishment.
The White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was told by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if their anonymity is maintained.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, as well as a spokesperson, if his anonymity is preserved.

The report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible impediment to justice can inevitably be expected further – his very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, according to the statement, Mueller’s investigation raises the question of whether Trump’s campaign was not carried out in secret in cooperation with our elections to the detriment of Russia.
If Congress were to move into other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution, at the same time as he is preparing to stand up again against the electorate and, perhaps, finally, against the Board of Governors.
There are a lot of “ifs” here, and I don’t say that the end of Trump is inevitable – just like his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will decide whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler, with the West resisting him and supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We got together and missed the opportunity to prevent the slaughter that lasted for several years.
History revolves around such essential turning points – then the unrelenting march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
Now, the Americans have come to a number of key turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein’s grievances began when the newspaper reported that last year the official had offered to secretly record the president and considered his ineligibility to take office.
Rosenstein says the story in The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new FTB investigation by Bretto Kavanaugh proves incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite credible allegations of sexual violence and false evidence, this candidate is assigned to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, in the mid-term elections, will we vote for Congress, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is in danger of a long winter.
But because of the lessons I learned in Prague, I hope that we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was taken to Osvencim by the same Nazi regime that once settled in a house where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years she sent me to light a shabby candle on the table with a swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how could I look at our future unoptimistic?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is waiting for an optimistic confrontation with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna knowing that if they win after a spectacular race in Spain earlier this month with Villarreal against the Austro, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was only able to appear for the first time this season in a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he hopes the Rangers can use this score as a springboard for more important goals.
“We had a good result because Villarreal is a great team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started playing in the hopes that we would achieve something, and we ended up achieving that.
Maybe in the end we could have been more peaceful, but overall the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first hurdle, and we got into the second hurdle and turned out to be a better team.
There will be another significant European League night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be tough because in the last competitions their result was great. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators we can break out ahead and achieve a good result.
Last year was a really tough year – and what happened to my injuries, and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that now we will be able to break out, forget the last season and play well.”
Women's fear of retirement savings is causing them to fall asleep.
While the survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they would like to receive, few spoke about it with family members.
About half of respondents in a nationwide survey said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not trying to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
Here's what to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not communicate your wishes in advance, the family will not be willing to take care of you.
Talk with your counselor and family about where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors can be important in predicting costs.
Invite a financial advisor. A consultant can also help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
You can choose to pay for long-term care with a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed cash-worth-life insurance certificate, or a mortgage on your property as long as you have the money.
Choose legal documents. Prevent legal disputes with documents that allow you to protect yourself.
Choose a health care authority. Appoint a trusted person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that the specialists will respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the accounts are paid if you become ineffective.
Do not forget the details. Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs urgent medical attention and takes him or her to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
To be prepared, write down these details on the plan.

Ilfracame pneumatic rifle several times shot man
After a night in the city, the man who went home was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
A 40-year-old man was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm in the Oxford Grave district of Devon.
At approximately 2:30 a.m., the shooting in England's summer time was described by officials as an accidental act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not pose a threat to his life, and the police are asking for the help of witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
"At least 384 were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday," officials said, adding that the death toll was expected to increase.
Due to the destruction of the communications services, officials were unable to obtain any data from the Dongal Regency, a ploughing area north of Palu, near the 7.5-point earthquake epicenter.
In the aftermath of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi.
With a population of about 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, established at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
When the quake struck and smashed, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that lies more than 300 km (180 miles) off the coast of the island of Sulawesi.
In Regenty – in a smaller administrative region than the province – there were about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main pillars of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, although it is mainly concentrated on the other side of the Sulawesi coast in Morovaly.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times in the last century by tsunamis.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes were destroyed in Dongal.
In addition, in 1996, he hit the western Dongal with sledgehammers and killed nine people.
Earthquakes continue to hit Indonesia, which is located on the ring of a seismicly active Pacific ring of fire.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a powerful quake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast – more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several powerful earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Niagara Falls.
The 2006 6.8 magnitude quake shook the southernmost populated part of the Indonesian island of Java and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
A magnitude 7.6 quake in 2009 shook the area near the western provincial capital of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
The 7.5 magnitude quake in 2010 shook one of the islands of Mentavaja near Sumatra and caused a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters, killing dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
In 2016, the Pidij<0xC4><0x97> Jaya Regency in Aceh was devastated and panicked as people remembered how everything was devastated after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this year, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong earthquakes shook the heavily visited island of Lombok by Indonesian tourists and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, while thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the coast.
Chief Sarahos Palin's son arrested for domestic violence charges
The charges have led to the arrest of Trackas Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarahos Palin.
A police report released on Saturday said 29-year-old Palin, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance in detention.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took the phone from her.
As reported by KTUU, Palin was returned to the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and released for a $500 security deposit.
“He appeared in court on Saturday, where he claimed to be completely innocent when asked to justify himself,” the network said.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with class B offences, a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal charge has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assaulting his home, preventing him from reporting a crime of domestic violence and keeping a weapon intact.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veterans groups when her son’s cruel behavior was linked to a traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died on Friday after a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, video footage of the tsunami strike is shared.
Cunamis hit the coast when hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspected New York Terrorist Attack
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
On October 31, Saipov, a 30-year-old man from Home Depot, was suspected of renting a truck and carrying out an attack on a bicycle along the western highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report by the Southern District of New York on the intention to seek the death penalty, prosecutors justifying the death penalty will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and caused serious injuries to the body.
According to the court document, both of these charges may result in the death penalty.
After several weeks of the attack, the federal grand jury of defendants issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, which included eight counts of murder related to the rape of property (usually the bribery of federal prosecutors and the transportation of motorist organized crime cases), and criminal charges.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and thought out in advance, and the way Saipov carried out it called it rude, cruel and immoral.

Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case in which the death penalty was demanded was in the Southern District of New York a decade ago.
Khalida Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in 1953 in the New York federal case of the spouses Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when they were sentenced two years ago for a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or a few months later.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack by Islamic State (ISIS) videos he was watching on his phone.
Police said he had also asked to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital palace.
He did not confess his guilt under 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the state-funded federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than pleading guilty and jailing for life without the possibility of being released, will only extend the trauma of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipovo’s defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to face the death penalty.
Tory MP says that must be responsible for Brexit negotiations NIGELAS FARAGE<0xCA><0xBC>AS
Today, during a Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation’s army.
A former UKIP leader said politicians must feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May's party MPs suggested he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have left now if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in trying to reunite the divided side of supporters have been revealed by the EU-backed Tories who joined a separate protest in the city against Brexit.
Prime Ministers find it difficult to implement the compromise plan agreed in the Czech Republic when it is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone said on Leave Means Leave in Solihale that he wanted to undermine Cheker's plan.
He claimed that Farage had to be an equal partner and had to be given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left the EU,” he said.
Wellingboro added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Cheker’s plan.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “In world wars, we are not fighting to obey others.
“We want to adopt our laws in our country.”
Bone denied the notion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a proponent of Brexit, also participated in the demonstrations and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Cheker's plan is unpopular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular among our party members and activists, who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up Cheker's plan and start listening."
In a critical statement, May added: "Prime Ministers retain their posts when they keep their promises."
Farage said in a statement that incumbent politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they make a decision in a referendum in 2016.
“It is now a matter of trust between us, the people and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to issue Brexit, so we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let it go.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of the nation of this country, which has brought us a Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud in the United Kingdom."
And opponents of Brexit marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists moaned with posters "Tories against Brexit".
Laborist Lord Adonis told the Conservatives about the security problems they experienced over the party's program when the conference began.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technologies needed for Canada plus, frictionless walls and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider taking part in Presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about his future at a meeting with the public in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is constantly criticizing President Donald Trump, is taking part in the November re-election that will meet with GOP state representative Geoffu Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign Masochusset.
It has been predicted that it will meet with Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjoke has been her 36th meeting with voters using the format of a public meeting with the public.
One participant asked if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the subjugated government, and it must be led by women.
Suspect Arrested in LSU Sims Shooting Case
Louisiana’s Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde<0xCA><0xBC> Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked to help identify the man who was seen in it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near the South University campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, Murphy J. Paul, the chief of police, told the media on Saturday that Wayde's Sims was shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde's stood up to defend a friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the crime scene, had a gun and shot Wayde's Sims.
Simpson was detained without resistance and was imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Police Department's detention facility.
198 cm high student Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of which started in five, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the field, earning 5.6 points, and rebounding 2 games.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title when the team tells him to give the victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteris Bott defeated Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team in the race would be extremely important.
Starting the race from the first place, Botts started perfectly and, judging his position in the first two laps, barely left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to turn into a two-door garage, leaving Hamilton and he returned to the race in the group's yard, so it was fateful.
Mercedes turned into a two-hole garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after barely finishing in touch, burst forward when the Ferrari driver, after a double-maneuver in the track, failed to save the position on the track.
Max Verstappen, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, started at the end of the race, but at the end of the first round, he was already seventh.
He was the most likely driver in most races, as he drove without changing the tyres to make it as fast as possible in the final, to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and finish fourth.
In the 44th round, he turned into a two-door garage, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen crossed the finish line in the fourth.
“Valtter had a tough day because he followed him perfectly throughout the weekend and when I was asked to pass, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and got the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday slammed Senator Dianne Feinstein for relentlessly denying Christine Blasey Ford's missing letter accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not directly name Ford's statements to the Senate Legal Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate showed that people are unkind, unkind, and wrong.
“What could have happened and what has actually happened in the Senate in recent days is when you see anger, when you see people being angry, bad, bad and wrong,” he said.
“When you see official statements and executions, and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you fallen?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did the document go missing? “Oh, oh, what?
No, I'm not.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t,” he added, imagining the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh, which had been abducted earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the letter had been abducted from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations and I did not deny her history.”
“She asked to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the president apparently disagreed with her rejection, saying during a meeting with the people on Saturday evening: “You know, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to judge a candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of illegal sexual behavior by three women, the president said the Democrats used the accusations to their advantage.
“They are determined to reclaim power by any means necessary.
You see innocence, unkindness; they don’t care what they hurt or what they have to overcome to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won two innings in a match with Dandi's Giants
The Dundee Stars lost to the Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League and won Saturday’s 5–3 draw against Dandi.
The Giants broke out early when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilliers won for two consecutive years.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were equal before Dwyer took Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard of the Dandi team equalized the result, but later two defeats of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered a third loss this season in the Elite League, before beating the club in Belfast on Friday night with a 2–1 win.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, with the Giants winning three previous games.
Dwyer hit the first inning in the fourth minute (3.35) after the transfer of Kendall McFaullo, and after another four minutes, Beauviller doubled the overweight after David Rutherford's transfer.
In hard-start matches, Sullivan returned the arena hosts to the game by winning a 13:10 lead, and after Matt Marquardt's transfer, Cownie's cleared the score of 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giants took the lead in the first break, and at the end of the first lift she won her second inning.
With a quantitative overlap, the field hosts beat and Bouchard again equalized the score of 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen break out of the Dandi team for the first time in the game at the end of the second lap, and consolidated the victory by winning the fifth lap of the team in the middle of the last lap.
The Giants, who have already lost the last four games out of five, will face Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
Flight Commander Killed to Help Hundreds of Plane Passengers Escape from Earthquake
The Indonesian flight manager has been declared a hero after he was killed while aboard a plane with several hundred passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are thought to have disappeared after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The site was further swept by strong repeated underground strikes and many people trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
While his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily-developed management tower at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in the city of Palu.
He stayed at his place of work to help the 6321-seat Batik Air, which was already on the runway at the time, take off safely.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower was crashing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Siraitas said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
He was flown by helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is an extremely painful news for us,” he added.
The government fears the death toll could rise to thousands as the country’s disaster mitigation agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigi and Boutongo are hard to reach.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to rise because many of the victims are still under the rubble and we cannot reach them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
A wave of up to six meters high destroyed the city of Palu; there will be a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies of supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, high-speed cars get injured.
There is a lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are being looted everywhere ."
Janis Gelfandas, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Jokas Widodos arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Aerial crash in Micronesia: Air News now says one man has disappeared after crashing into a lagoon
The flight, which ended in a plane crash in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, is now said to have been missing by one person, although it has previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members had been rescued from the crash.
In a statement, Air News reported that she had no knowledge of a single passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew when the plane crashed while attempting to land at the Chuku Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what was the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing track.
Some witnesses of the incident believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane crashed from a very low ground.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to get to the emergency exits in a crashed and up to the waistline submerged plane.
He said the flight satellites were covered in panic and screaming, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said it had also helped rescue people who had been transported by inflatable boats to the shores before sinking to a depth of about 30 meters in the vicinity of the navy.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in plane crashes in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have belonged to Air News.
Analyst lays out a sequence of events during the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office said the facts were available in a retrial case of a man accused of burning a woman alive from the Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the court of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone footage to connect 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and nineteen-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movement on the night of his death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber on the eve of her death, which contradicts earlier statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not in his city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telly was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “lieving because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another coincidence was that Tellis claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlet said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and addressee information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
It is expected that the defense will begin to teach its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge told me that the case would be handed over to the defendants later on the same day.
The High Breed: What Is A Deliberate Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative attitude to this genre, spreading their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, based in Bristol, claims that hip hop has detached itself from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to return to the sources of hip hop and re-popularize the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently reappeared in the UK in the works of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another black?
New York Nurse Tried Couple After She Was Fired for ‘Rassist’ Message
A New York City nurse filed a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a message from her mother that she was “another black woman” at the wrong address.
The couple denies existing racists and called the lawsuit "rape".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was shocked to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEE, BUT ONE JUDGE,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But she sent it twice, not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the misunderstood Plasco-Flaxman felt uneasy and fired Maurice, claiming that the former nurse, who was an African-American, had done poorly in her job and was hoping to get a Filipino instead.
Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent home by Uber.
Maurice has now sued a couple demanding compensation for his acquittal and seeks to pay up to $350 a day for half a year of life and work at a client’s home to whom she was initially hired even without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do such things,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple, who had been accused of racism for years, denied it and said it was wise to fire Maurice because they feared she could not be trusted after she was insulted.
“My wife sent her what she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plascas.
“Would you trust your children with someone you were foolish to, even though it was a mistake?
Your Newborn?
No way."
Plascas, who described the case as “rape,” said the woman had a baby just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to judge for that?
This is not a very nice behavior,” added the investment banking specialist.
While the case was being investigated, the media scolded the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers are afraid that readers will not understand the talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s sad to feel somewhere else reading the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it’s very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a plush bear, would not have been too upset if his work had been rejected, and added that his maternity was dead at the age of 60 after the release of the book.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as a “very important family member,” she added that the father was quietly proud of his success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and didn’t like to be proud,” she said.
“Because Paddington was so similar to him, he felt like he had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he was equally appreciative of Paddington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always devoted his merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was immortal and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to Nicos Louis Pasteur's Hospital 2, where doctors were unable to save her life.
“Nadas kept calling and saying that the situation was really bad, she is not expected to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nado who called to say that she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said good-bye.
I told her, “Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors given the drugs that supported her heartbeat, slowly stopped working and removed from the body.
She died a little earlier, and that was the end of it.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t huddle, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep that in my mind.”
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now devastating her dead daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, not realizing what a difficult test she needs to overcome.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was lowered and tears were burning all the time.
It’s hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a great deal of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in need of openings to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women, who have lost their loved ones, are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge distribute openings with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and call for help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want a single parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mr. Davis, 45, who lives in the city, said her son was a very promising boss with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminates the room.
But he quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his suicide brother.
Mr. Davis said, “I am constantly afraid that a chain reaction may occur.”
Mr. Davis created the openings so that people would know that there are people in the environment that you can talk to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Mr. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who retired shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed, depressed, and he didn’t complain about anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The situation was quite bad during Christmas: when the kids rolled out their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye and didn’t react in any way.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “In the family, it left an emptiness.
It breaks our heart.
But we all have to live and fight.”

FTB launches investigation, Bretto Kavanaugh's future will be on the shelves
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for — a study of limited duration and scope — maybe we could bring some unity,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “in the hands of hard-liners.”
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FTB to start an investigation?
It is only time that decides against them.
There are only five weeks left before the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to turn up badly, their efforts to elect the person they want to the country’s highest court will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators, trying to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, former Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FTB submits its report?
Voting will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to disconnect and approve him to the Supreme Court.
After Kim came to power, the number of North Korean deserters “decreased”
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea had dropped when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said 1,127 deserts were identified last year, compared to 2,706 deserts in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tightening of North Korean-China border controls and rising prices for human trafficking.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
For many North Korean desserts, South Korean citizenship is eventually offered.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers desertions illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, which were at the center of which were blocked negotiations on the denial of nuclear weapons.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when the two essentially agreed to make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday accused the U.S. of not changing its sanctions since then.
“If there is no confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally defend ourselves in any way,” Ri said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these remarks during an interview he gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I just can’t believe that if a woman did this, she would be said to be hysterical,” Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, when he spoke about family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes unprofessional, or unprofessional.
He also totally denounced the former Democrats in the committee, accusing him of calling it a “grotesque and coordinated destruction of the reputation” organized by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Mr Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not work for the Supreme Court because he exposed his bias towards the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the Clinton and Democrats attack,” she said.
Asked whether he would seek to remove Kavanaugh if his candidacy were approved and the majority of votes received by Democrats in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
“I’ll say this – if he’s lying to Congress or the FTB, it’s not appropriate to go to office not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrat, was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions on the Accessible Health Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the approval hearings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be revoked.
“Now is not the time for us to say, ‘How wonderful!’ when we become a judge of an impartial, impartial personality,” Pelosi said.
The Power That Women Should Use
This is a legitimate critique – it’s finally gone for months and even a year of accrual that she can’t say without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms. Stein told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She went on: “I was helped by a woman, a manager of a company, who told me that she also cries when she’s angry, but she developed a certain method: angry and crying, she said to the man you were talking to at the time: ‘I don’t think you’re worth it.
“I’m really angry.”
And she just kept crying.
It seemed brilliant to me.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from one of the first jobs in the office, where most of the men worked and where I once started to cry about an undeniable inconvenience. Then I was caught by an older woman behind the waist, a tough manager, who always got a little attached to me, and stretched out.
“Never let them see you crying,” he told me.
They don’t know you’re jealous.
They think you’re sad, so they’ll be glad you’ve overcome them.”
Democratic congressman Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught alienating on the ship "Monkey Business" and withdrew his candidacy, Mr. Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason why he could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out solution,” he told me with a laugh after 30 years.
At the time, there were seven other candidates, so we really didn’t need one more.
Someone called me "Snowflakes with seven dwarfs."
After the late start of the campaign, there was little time left to raise funds, so she vowed not to publish the candidacy until she raised $2 million.
It was an uneven struggle.
She noticed that some sponsors, who donated $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?” she asked.
Speaking in which he announced the start of a formal campaign, it was so encompassed by emotions – gratitude for the people he supported, a system of disappointment that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and reach voters directly, rather than representatives, and anger over sexism – that was right.
“You’d think I was nervous,” Schroeder recalled the press response to her speech.
– You would have thought that I was supported by Kleenex napkins business.
I remember thinking, what will be recorded in my grave memorial.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S. and China trade times can be beneficial to Beijing
The first salmon war between the U.S. and China has been developed, and although the battle has not yet ended well, experts say, inconvenience may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a first warning this year that he has imposed tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest dispute occurred this week, when new tariffs came into effect on goods with a value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), i.e., will essentially tax half of China’s goods exported to the US.
Beijing responded to all measures at the same time – the latest decision imposes a tariff of five to ten percent on American goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the U.S. tooth for tooth, and it seems that the world’s second-largest market is definitely not going to land anytime soon.
Washington would only ease sanctions if China complied with the demands, but publicly bowing down to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing properly closes its party, the difficulties of the trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of these markets.
“The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would make the economy of both countries more dangerous than observers have so far recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia New America Works Centre.
Syria's Foreign Minister Says He Is Ready to Accept Returning Refugees
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in re-establishing a country that has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualems said conditions in the country are improving.
"Because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation in the territory has become much more stable and safer," he said.
The government continues its efforts to restore the devastated areas of the terrorists and restore the normal situation.
All conditions have already been established for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions aimed at everyday life and well-being.
According to UN estimates, Syria has left about 5.5 million Syrians since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to restore the destroyed country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from the parties supporting the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team, which defeated the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Rider Cup at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Rider Cup in this continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, enough to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was hard to follow throughout the tournament, kicked a shot from the starting pitch right into the water at a score of 16 in a three-day match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari won all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament took its current form.
The American Jordan Spieth 5:4 was defeated by the lowest-ranked European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top scorer, lost 2–1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Rider Cup tournament.
Sergio Garcia, the veteran of the eight Rider Tournament tournaments, has become the most successful European player of all time, scoring 25.5 points in his career.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t control myself today.
It was an easy year.
I am very grateful to Mr. Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy that we have recovered the cup.
It all depends on the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said in a statement after the European victory.
He handed the relay to his homelander John Ram, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's 2–1 unit game.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahma.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning the top 14 prizes and landing only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team did not manage to hit the wheelchair all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyck said after a disappointing team appearance: “I’m proud of these guys, they’re fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we started to press the Europeans.
We hiked.
I'm wearing a hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Rider Cup committee, and we're going to move on.
“I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
He needs to bend his head.
"Our opponents were superior to us."
"Red Flood" news. Concentrations in Printela, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) states that the total concentration of the "red flood" in the Tampa Bay Aquarium is decreasing.
According to the FWC, more fragmented flowering has been observed in the counties of Painelas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which makes it possible to assume that the concentration decreases.
The "Red Flood" flowering includes about 130 miles of coastline from northern Painela to southern Li counties.
The flowering areas can be found about 10 miles from the coast in Hilsboro County, but they are less than last week.
The "Red Flood" was also observed in Pasko County.
Last week, it was reported that the concentration in the county of Painelas and along its coast was medium, along the coast of Hilsboro County – from low to high, in the county of Manati – from the background to high, in the county of Sarasota – from the bottom to the bottom of the hill, in the county of Cologne and along the coast – from the bottom to the top.
Cases of respiratory tract irritation have still been reported in Painelas, Manati, Sarasota, Li and Collieri counties.
There were no reports of respiratory tract irritation in northwest Florida last week.
