Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worsening
On Friday evening, there was a traffic accident on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick response.
Driver oversees biker
A 44-year-old car driver wanted to turn left on the state road 1230 towards Machtolsheim with her VW from Merklingen around 21.30.
In doing so, she ignored the 24-year-old motorist from Nellien.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the event of a collision
The biker was still trying to get away from the car, but still drove it to the rear of the vehicle.
The hand and foot brakes were ripped off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
In his mind, he controlled his motorcycle in the green stripes next to the road and let it roll off there without falling into place.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury to the leg and had to be treated in a clinic.
Breastfeeding: Corona Mass Infection: 174 Harvesters Infected
After a mass infection from Corona on a large vegetable farm in the Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are not allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive for the Corona-CoV-2 strainer during the series investigation, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.
"To avoid further spread, we unfortunately need to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the row test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beets - but the cucumbers are only for insertions.
Mamming is a rural community with over 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
Infected people were separated from uninfected employees on the farm, and the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the checks on the housing of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly revenged if such local infection events are to be exploited and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary managing director.
The SPD sees this very similar: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already requested a special control programme for farms with harvest aids," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions have to be strictly controlled from our point of view.
This obviously didn’t happen.”
The eruption came "with an announcement."
Aidenbachstraße U-Bahn: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into bed after pusher
In a dispute between two youth groups at the subway station Aidenbachstraße, a 19-year-old man fell through a pusher and slipped into a rail bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, at the subway station Aidenbachstraße at 4.15 p.m., there was a dispute between two youth groups.
A passerby alerted the police who attacked with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a 17-year-old Municher pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the railing and fell into the railing bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the downtrodden climb from the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there was a dispute between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled the scene at first, but his personalities could be determined later.
In the company of his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is diagnosed with a body injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of stock data
The storage of inventory data is currently suspended.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, however, called for an extension of the storage period according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended storage of inventory data, according to a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks a half-year.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick law change.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently necessary amendments to the law already now," the newspaper quoted the letter as saying.
Currently, the storage of stock data is suspended.
A decision of the Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments in advance, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgement, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Justice Department told the newspaper that it would only make sense to examine whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already in June voted for a stockpile of data.
NBA: Strip Club upset for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, a Los Angeles Clippers basketball pro, is said to have left the Disney World Tournament Quarter in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, is back in Isloation and is being tested for COVID-19 daily.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, “Sweet Lou,” as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these exact wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, D.R.) have the best wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
As a result, the Clippers star misses the first two official matches after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams with training matches are preparing for the season finale starting on Friday night.
Söder expresses its opinion on the Corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a vaccine for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau district has intimidated authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, with more than a third infected with the Corona stimulus.
The courtyard is now under quarantine and is closed with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the area, food is delivered.
The 3,300 inhabitants of the municipality are now offered free Corona tests by the authorities.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the yard.
"Conscience": Confession of the alleged firefighter of Nantes
“My client has proven to be cooperative,” lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the actions very much, the confession was a release for him."
His mandate was “pested by conscience and taken very seriously by the extent of the destruction.”
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor’s office.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire last Saturday night.
The fire broke out in three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory investigations have heightened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, now in custody, had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But after a day, he was released.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came to the attention of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50<0x2B>1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended to consider abolishing the 50<0x2B>1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," Grindel told the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the clubs that can be most dangerous to Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50<0x2B>1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In so far as you do not get around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50<0x2B>1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of pulling investment fences in a European internal market to the Bundesliga's economic location," Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the risk that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of the TV funds will not achieve a decisive effect.
FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million euros and RB Leipzig of 300 million euros.
So the differences are already immense among the first three associations alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million,” the 58-year-old explained.
Looking back on the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and pushed through the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
“I’ve been very busy humanly.”
He received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to pull the consequences out of it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous gift of the watch, I was completely transparent and merciless.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a hay from the gift,” the 58-year-old said.
“You might call that naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption.”
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have again spiked with Donald Trump’s use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between protesters and police in various cities.
In Louisville, three people were injured, 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was shot dead while a demonstration train was just crossing a crossroads.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly drove out protesters.
Hundreds of armed protesters marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the Razzia was someone else who didn’t even live there, and no drugs were found either.
When a member of a group called himself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to the NBC broadcaster, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them floated at risk of life.
The police set up barricades because counter-protesters had also formed a white militia.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
According to police, a suspect was taken into custody.
To date, she has not made any further details of the circumstances of the act.
Mayor Steve Adler told The New York Times that he was, as many people in the city, "uncomfortable and incomprehensible" about what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in the U.S. metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set a car on fire in front of a juvenile prison, police used blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or bodily harm.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters slammed windows, shot fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car was driving through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
According to police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was hospitalized.
In addition, windows were also slammed in a courthouse and a fire was put out, police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the large sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy party.
But: Even if the great party miles in the city center were missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy ball or citadel, many came at the expense of the Corona-compliant alternative program.
“I think we managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair,” says Kurdish director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one went back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, and only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant Atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time, too, in the Corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watch the historics while they are flirting, and listen to Cuban live music at the Spielbank restaurant.
“I find it very pleasant,” says Konhäuser.
They do not miss the masses of people who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you lack the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday night as well as the historic fortification and the final fireworks on Sunday night.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year,” he said.
Rakoczy Riding Tournament to be held again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant in part more work.
For example Christina Gold, who participates in the festivities in a normal year and can be seen there on the couch of the Kurgarten Café.
This year she was walking around the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's already more strenuous, otherwise we've got it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were on their way to the park.
“We very much hope that the cavalry squadron will be held again next year,” says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will take place again.
28 Corona cases at Spanish Second League Fuenlabrada
Spanish football second-league CF Fuenlabrada slid deeper into the crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid had flown to a game in the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on 20 July despite the first Corona cases, a deep blow follows the next one.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the town of the same name southwest of Madrid had so far had the chance to reach the climbing playoffs.
Now even the descent into Group B of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was canceled at the last minute, the prosecutor's office is investigating for a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced departure of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper wrote.
Photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their hotel rooms for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It’s neither good nor good enough, he said.
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The charge of deliberately endangering public health was dismissed by the club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
It has not violated the Corona rules set by the football association, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, emphasized, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Before the departure, there were four people infected by July 19, but all of them were isolated and did not travel with them.
Just before the flight to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on Monday, all players and team members were re-tested.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, there were five or six other team members who were positive in the Corona test.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before the anpfiff, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must capture horses ripped off by steam
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning just before 6 a.m., a traffic participant notified two free-running horses on the conveyor between the mouth of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the Theres motorway junction.
At the arrival of the officers, the horses were already again between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the horses were able to gain the confidence of the officers shortly before steaming, they each had a rope carried in the strip wagon.
Radprofi Tony Martin: Career Continuation Imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just setting out the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Previously, he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little girl, I think: What if?
The cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it was good for me to remember from the Corona era what I have in cycling and how much fun it makes me."
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August), the time travel specialist will return to the competition event.

Kovac Tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac, his new club AS Monaco will soon see him again with Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French champion will host on 1 August (18:00) at the Hesse, the former club of Croatia.

It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
Sportily, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-ranking opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had joined the succession of the Croatian.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the eighth-final match against Basel in their own stadium by 0:3.

In the county of Hof, the number of known coronavirus infections on the weekend has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is cured and no longer falls into this statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city of Hof.
As a result, the space court is approaching the critical brand of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 dead due to monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Due to heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people died.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent tries to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernashorns in National Park die from landslide
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank hornets died from landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which is the result of knowledge accumulations on climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty.
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
There is also enthusiasm in Grenada.
Anyone who used to own a house, it was also so small and similar to a cottage, often does not want to spend his life in a large residential block.
Many apartments are empty, but the government wants them to soon be taken away from those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina Refuses to Offer Creditors in Retirement
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debts of the second-largest economy in South America are no longer bearable under the current conditions.
That is why Argentina is calling on its private creditors to waive some of its claims of about $66 billion (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country is threatened again by the state.
It would be the ninth payment default in Argentine history.
Lately, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
Lastly, the inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle US$503 million in interest claims, resulting in a limited payment default.
Arrived professionally - not yet in private
"It works great" - this conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days in the notary office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden Notary Office.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the graduated lawyer took up the work, the normal daily business is long on full tours.
"I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler indicator and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, was not enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently, she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who works in Regensburg as a judge at the county court.
At least her husband could still apply for short-term parental leave in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (aged 31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she sometimes also has an opportunity to stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has been a term for her for a long time.
During visits to the area with her family in the past months, she has then remarked: "Eggenfelden is a really nice little town".
She was all the more pleased that she made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s career, her homeland in Lower Bavaria also plays a central role: After studying Jura in Passau, she completed her referenda period and the 2nd state exam in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assistant, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at that time she also "besides" the promotion in labour law - she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in 2012.
In 2016, she went into parenthood, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was suspended due to the imminent retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of its predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a compliment for the team of the firm ready: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the impending displacement of the private food point.
In the case of kindergarten and cradle areas, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything goes as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in case of a fan return.
"Due to the distance control that is mandatory, we are planning according to the current stand with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt at Bundesliga games attracts just over 81,000 spectators.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BNP had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalisation at the BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the around 4,000 places in the hospitality sector can be reopened: "It is of course a blow to the office when these revenues completely break away".
In the face of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-term employment alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their partial waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short work."
Little Miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a Packerl butter, just once three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 early nurses who are cared for at the Graz Children’s Clinic every year.
A quarter of them weighing less than 1,500 grams, a couple—like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael—are extreme lightweight with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Your skin is sometimes so tender that it could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that sometimes they wear doll clothes and mini-windows made specifically for them.
But not so small that they would not have a voice - "and how," mutters Berndt Urlesberger.
"Although, of course, they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grade of the St. James High School in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen City Theatre presented to the pupils the production "Das Heimatkleid" - via video.
Subsequently, the students were able to exchange via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the teaching.
In the end, although all the participants agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional incentives, the potential for contact in the schools is also seen in the theatre.
“If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation,” said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: The TSV 1860 would meet Frankfurt in the DFB Cup on Eintracht
Should the TSV qualify for the DFB Cup in 1860, the lions will meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are determined.
The Lions would meet Frankfurt at a successful qualification on Eintracht.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday night in the ARD sports show.
Because due to the Corona pandemic, the participant field is not yet complete, space holders were used in the draw.
With the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If Zweiliga-Aufsteiger Würzburg reached the final, sixty-two would already qualify for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to beat Regionalligist Aschaffenburg in the final game.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the start of the Third League.
Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104 with a natural death, her spokeswoman for the German news agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the 1939 South State film "Vom Winde verweht".
Born as a child to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio contracted her for seven years and brought her out with Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, the award for Best Actress came in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She was also given a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentrician in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Hosehole".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the lead role in the filming of her novel "Meine Cousine Rachel" in 1952.
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenlied for a corpse".
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gis<0xC3><0xA8>le with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, however, have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final at Comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they beat their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last September, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final game on the Rhine, their bezwingers Ehlers/Flüggen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with a 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played at the beginning of September in Timmendorfer Strand: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz draft from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "feature sheet"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, from the FDP’s point of view, only a “separate piece” and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD,” said Benjamin Strasser, the FDP’s interior politician, of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Court of Arbitration of the AfD had on Saturday in Stuttgart, after a multi-hour hearing, confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
“If the AfD really wanted to remove right-wing extremists consistently from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded for a long time,” Strasser said.
"But there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "World on Sunday".
"It rather speaks volumes of how many frantic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD".
Blumen expects that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the now officially dissolved "wing" of the Thuringian AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection denounces the trench as a "safety right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD’s Federal Chairman had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not indicate a previous membership in the now-banned far-right "Home Faithful German Youth" (HDJ) and among the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
Also the chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Calvitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened with this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troupe is transparent.
One wants to avoid further observation through constitutional protection and try to get under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the ghosts it called.
A draft does not change anything yet," commented Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here held the AfD national association and the faction to this day to their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms provide well 21% more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind turbines in the German North Sea supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
This is well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet’s network area, have supplied an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared with 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Wind harvests at sea account for almost 19 percent of all wind in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide for higher production capacity <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy, in addition to the wind conditions, is due to higher production capacities, because in the last 12 months new wind farms have gone to the grid.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion in the expansion of offshore network connections,” said Tim Meyerjürgens, CEO of Tennet.
In reality, wind farms can not even use their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small celebration of the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the club "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We certainly did not make this decision easy for us and - in the awareness of how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (unbiased).
"But in the end, we are here as organizers responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flowed to the mainland and to the main tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Coronavirus Regulation.
Or the constraints would have been so strong that there would not be much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring expenditure would increase disproportionately by a multiplier.
Rumberg reassured him for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur Olympian Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories in four starts over the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with white gold and Quantaz, she was also in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and not to be beaten in the heat.
On the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold, Werth made a clear stand against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the special on Sunday.
On Saturday, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cure at all.
Even at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Wert had won all four important exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More flight tickets in Worms in the future
The University of Worms continues to develop: the "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to enable the start of studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the flight security academy of the DFS are equally exhausted.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students are in the Air Traffic Management program at Worms University.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lotus training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lotus profession.
“In these times, it is not easy for us to support economically.
However, we firmly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS when signing the contract.
“For DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide pilots with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms, also underlines this: “The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and economics.
With it, we want to connect to the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual undergraduate program Air Traffic Management".
The trust of German Aviation Safety is at the same time a motivation and a commitment for the University of Worms to further develop its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
With the first foundation professorship for a dual degree program, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focus for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
For about 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was completely blocked in the direction of Aschaffenburg on Saturday afternoon, as the rescue helicopter was in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man was driving a Ford around 12.40 in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve straight out and landed on the dashboard.
The collision triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were cared for by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown into a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about 2,000 euros, had to be towed off.
According to the meat industry, Heil wants to examine other industries
The Corona crisis brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Law tightening is just ahead.
But are they right--and will they stay with it?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the now-planned stringent regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German news agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting employment contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the Fleischriesen Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to decide on a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses shall no longer employ foreign personnel in slaughtering, decommissioning and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of employment contracts and hire workers is prohibited there.
Ingo Kramer, president of employers, said: “Finger away from a general restriction of employment contracts and employee leave, if you don’t want to completely wipe out the economy.”
Work contracts, for example, for large areas of the crafts, the construction industry and the plant construction, are the basis for their added value to the customer.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban labor contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts would make sense.
"If an industrial company orders a craftsman to install a safety plant, that's a very normal factory contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on labour contracts and leasing work in its industry to be unconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why, in the future, different labour law should apply to serving and packaging cheese than to sausage, according to a statement on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
Under a ban, consumer prices would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram per product.
Many Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked in the industry, partly 16 hours a day, according to the results of an audit by the NRW-Arbeitsschutzverwaltung.
They often did not have a break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively strict law had already entered into force in 2017 for the meat industry.
However, by tricky constructions, these had been bypassed.
"Now it needs to be fundamentally cleaned up".
The politician announced: "The Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide at the end of July in the cabinet, also includes measures that concern not only the meat industry - for example, higher rates of checks on labour protection or clear criteria for community housing".
The draft dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and to the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to do even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg current".
However, more staffing is also needed for more checks.
Three dead in ultralight plane crash in Germany
Three people have been killed in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, police said.
A child was easily injured.
Two other people were rescued in the accident, a spokesperson for the Wesel circuit said.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, police said.
The "Rhine Post" reported on eyewitnesses that the plane had crashed with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
More details were not known at first.
The evacuation of Frankfurt’s Opera House proceeds peacefully
A week after the protests in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the opera house in the night on Sunday also took place peacefully.
Lastly, a few dozen people were still standing on the square, but left him before the start of the lockdown at 1 a.m.
The police had been in operation since early in the evening with numerous officers, a larger police order could be seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, a curfew was imposed on the Opera House, where a week ago there had been a clash.
Policemen had been attacked out of the crowd with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car crashes: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the way to her residence in Hümme on the Bundesstraße 83 when her car came off the highway for an unexplained cause and overlapped several times.
In order to save the unfortunate, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car free.
As it was unclear if anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was scanned from the rotary conductor with a thermal imaging camera.
The Warburg drone crew, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the forces did not find anyone among the high maize plants.
The seriously injured person was taken to the Kassel Clinic for further care with the ambulance.
Nearly 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champion in Italy
Turin - After a rescuing goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the overall 36th Scudetto in club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, without the last long-time injured former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer pushing from place one two days before the end of the season in Serie A.
The Inter Milan table is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half, but Ronaldo came up with a free kick variant with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic exploited the 35-year-old from the penalty area directly with a flat shot (45.<0x2B>7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the unsurpassed but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter shot at the latte in the 89th minute was probably only Ronaldo himself with a view to the Torjäger score.
"It's complicated, mentally and physically, to stay at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1–2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve finally had the calming lead at the top of the table due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will still be a goalkeeper king is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already 34 goals on his account after his three-pack in the 5:1 (1:1) table-bound Lazio Roma at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski helped to win the title of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current juve professional Gonzalo Higua<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title opportunity awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus are in the Champions League eighth final, but must play a 0:1 match against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and in the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Comparative figures for the previous years are not available, but the law enforcement agencies are increasingly working: in 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted for illegal races between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year1 by the beginning of the year.
The races were less about organized events, as is evident from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously ran into each other or they would have taken the escape from the police - also this is shown as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly in charge.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 fines have been imposed.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car racing is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the several tragic accidents and processes of the past years and more frequently indicated, a ministry spokesman said.
Particularly popular with racers is the 8th motorway. Drivers are always slowing down traffic there to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race route"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
There, a speed limit is used to try to brake the shaver on the particularly affected section between the narrows and the geisings.
The most expensive and uplifted sports and luxury cars often have Swiss badges, because the drivers dodge to Germany for lawn mowing due to the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres, we would solve this problem on highways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD Landtagsfraktion.
"The threshold for razors would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be on the road here and there legally with 200 hourly kilometres and more."
In terms of enlightenment or image campaigns, Rivoir says less: "Whoever in such a way sets himself above all rules and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other traffic participants at stake is reasonably hardly attainable."
ADAC Calls for Strengthening of Police
This, on the other hand, is not enough for the ADAC: “We assume that razors cannot be deterred by the speed limits,” says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed power trade fair becomes more painful and more serious: from January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died at the races nationwide, two of them unattended in a nightly crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men competed in a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bumped against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one more people have been injured in the races over the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle branches is not seen," it says in the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light from July 23rd: thirsty burglar steals drinks from imbiss
A man broke into an imbiss in Rohrdorf (Calw County) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3:40 a.m. and ran towards the imbiss.
There he noticed a man who served himself at the refrigerator with drinks and then left the snack through a previously slapped front door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the imbiss.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and light shoes.
Further testimony is being received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann has fought his second victory of the day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old pälzer from the Bora-hansgrohe team made his way through the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season's wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall rating, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger performed.
The 26-year-old had decided to go mountaineering in the morning and thus took the lead in the ranking.
Only 104 drivers entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountaineering season.
"I'm really happy to start the season reboot with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
300 meters ahead of the goal, he simply pulled his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the UCI World Federation, a Corona test was performed on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organization team and from the media.
Viewers at start and finish were not allowed.
Board of Directors gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Dusseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Dusseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay in the water when bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call went in just before 1 p.m.
“A conductor immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation,” a firefighter told BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the resuscitation measures shortly thereafter.
The life-threatening child was transported to the clinic under resuscitation.
Why it failed is not clear.
The police routinely started the investigations into the accident.
The firefighter said: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - police intercept 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and occasionally more than 1,000 people took part Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police enforced their announcement to tighten the control of such events.
A great tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg’s southern city.
Hundreds of vehicles were involved.
According to Polizei Mittelfranken, around 10:30 p.m., the Nuremberger Verkehrspolizei detected an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstadter Straße.
After that, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
Recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up action against so-called car posers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: only a small part of the "scene"
Officials numbered at the top about 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people, police say.
Of this, however, only a small part of the attendees are assigned to the "autobags" and tuning scenes.
Apparently, most of the scene in question followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it should be assumed that this was mainly a shady case.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed by 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found construction changes in 10 vehicles in such a way that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franken Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on the incident and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the arrival of rioters," it said.
News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They have all the beautiful rims that we must not scratch," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to do any damage.
"The young people should finally get their cars back unharmed".
Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-term work
The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-term wages, according to its own statement.
“This is extremely small in more than 880,000 companies that have shown short-term work,” said Daniel Terzenbach of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, who is responsible for the operational business.
When, at the start of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more we will look at the final calculations.
I'm sure there'll be some more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments go together, but we are arming ourselves for the case and already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money."
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage Site in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden disbanded
Potsdam - On Friday night about 40 young people celebrated a party in the Neuen Garten.
The collection was disbanded at 8:48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday night, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by district drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Illegal celebrations are held in the parks over and over again.
In the parks of the Foundation, collections often occur where the distance and hygiene rules are not complied with by the Covid-19 Circulation Regulation.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the Neuen Garten.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed when the darkness breaks in.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young trainees are in tourism establishments, but at least one holiday host has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The lockdown time was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Individual guests were also able to leave early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of practitioners who had celebrated in several venues and may have become infected there.
“We all liked to do that in our youth,” he told the radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
On Friday, however, two bars were closed to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young people about the dangers of COVID-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The eruption evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tirol, which was a centre of the Corona outbreak throughout Europe during the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - England's record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured their third place in the table with a 2-0 (0:0) victory against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified as fourth for the Royals.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice.
Manchester United took the lead by a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71th minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the postseason, Jesse Lingard (90.<0x2B>8) reached the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eighth-final against FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.<0x2B>1) and Olivier Giroud (45.<0x2B>4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"It means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as a Chelsea coach is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace still passed the Wolves and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided on a long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but West Ham United had to shake for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84) immediately equalled Andrej Jarmolenko (85).
However, the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) to Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, declines after five league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who was unable to save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
FC Liverpool, who has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the point record in English football.
The top scorer holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the match on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütze van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League boss will be happy.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there has even been a discussion about a premature discontinuation or a holding of the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played without any special events - however, as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are getting more and more violent.
There were violent clashes during the night.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, Israeli police took violent action against participants of a demonstration against the right-wing Conservative government leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used, among other things, a water thrower to dissolve the announcement.
A total of 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu’s headquarters on Saturday night, according to media reports.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
Also in many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a driving car on protesters on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, it is prevented from premature relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the country’s economy difficult.
Lastly, the unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter power on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen claimed nine minor injuries.
A car driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police said: “She probably had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn away.”
This must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter who was behind her, probably too late.
He leaned back on the car.
Three occupants in the car and six in the transporter were lightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea Blocks Border City after Corona Suspicion
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own measures to protect against the coronavirus.
This is the first time the country has reported a suspected case.
Due to a first official coronavirus case in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a major city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite stringent epidemiological defenses over the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been dragged into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership called for the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the country shot.
North Korea had so far not registered a single infection and described its defenses as a “lightening success.”
The information has been questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a "outlaw" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four-kilometre wide and mostly still minted military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, the South Korean military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There have been investigations of some people.
North Korea on Saturday called an emergency meeting of the Labour Party’s political office, chaired by the ruling party’s leader Kim Jong Un, over the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
As early as Friday, Kim ordered as a preventive measure to “fully block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others.”
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with them, were quarantined.
Accordingly, the party’s central military commission is to investigate the “outbreak” as well as the behavior of the military unit responsible and impose severe punishment if necessary.
There are an estimated 300,000 people living in Kaesong.
Tension before council meeting: City-East and noise protection still ahead of big summer break to discuss
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committees will also vote on the construction plan for the large-scale urban development project East", it is rather casual in the middle part of the city press release for the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m.
Above all, however, the upgrading of the eastern city is debated until the end.
The majority for this is scarce, lastly even rejective in individual committees depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, commerce and IT), the project developed out of citizenship and then by the administration and municipal council, now not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticised project opponents Reinhard Klein as "false" and "false opposition", "disappointment", "disappointment".
"Everyone thinks it's better to know," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit will make the city cheaper, the Technical Town Hall is opposed to statements of the city administration after grants, which Klein is convinced of their existence, to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than one predicts in the town hall and on the part of the proponents from the economy.
Designing the city by its own power and not by an investor: Plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Council House, the openness of the Schlossberg, the rental of the ex-thal for administrative areas and a smaller inner-city remodeling ideally with local support.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheimer population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many time reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent that this has to happen, because they have, by neglecting the bus traffic with diluted paces, and by so little commitment to the ranks.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession of the state of Baden-Württemberg to the climate pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban childcare facilities and the application for admission to the federal smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but they must heed the measures taken to protect Corona.
With a lot of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost a half-year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of the super sports cars could begin regular operation, the first test rides were now stopped.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season,” says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really did have a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years of experience in GT sport, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other dazzlingly and we have made tremendous progress on the Lausitz ring from session to session as well".
That’s where the GT Masters will be performing their first race – at the Lausitzring.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of the 15 newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track very little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing team Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passes that you have to optimally hit to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, play poker a little bit during the tests," he says.
"But finally we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
Momentary stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take on the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The UK government’s decision to quarantine Spain’s holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country’s transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising number of Coronavirus cases in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine charges.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on the day of the holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is considered in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
“Many ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain,” Labour MP Diane Abbot said.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapps note".
Nearly a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict baseline barriers, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly make nightlife responsible for the recent spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
The British government currently advises against non-necessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, particularly popular with British holidaymakers, being exempted from this.
To date, more than 272,000 infections have been registered in Spain with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths.
Russia: Naval Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the day of the navy in his country the equipment of warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defense also informed the agency of successful tests of the hypersonic missile zircon built for the navy.
The hypersonic guns have a multiplier of the sound speed of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo is being built further
It will also be built on the nuclear-capable underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself was also driving a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has a coastline as large as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated nationwide by Matrosen.
Also in many other Russian coastal places, the navy forces start the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Munitions were also fired there.
In a video released by the Department of Defense, not only warships, including a submarine, but also fighter helicopters and jets were seen.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Aid made difficult by Corona
Washington - This year's first hurricane across the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the U.S. Climate Authority’s National Hurricane Center NOAA said on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott called for the emergency for many districts.
The coronavirus pandemic in Texas has made the work of aid workers more difficult, Abbott said.
Evacuated for Precaution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott told the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the turbulent storm in Texas, he added, “This challenge is complicated and is exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state.”
According to the Johns Hopkins University, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not miss practices “that we have become accustomed to,” such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone stays at a distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
It should also be tested for Corona in emergency shelters.
Damage was first reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Retrieved
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, Hannah was reportedly hit on the island of Padre Island just off the coast of Texas on land.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to Hurricane One, the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had first been issued and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hannah" continued to move inland and flow to northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was traveling in the night on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour towards Hawaii.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected it to further weaken.
It is predicted to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic this year, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season after a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could be very strong swirling storms, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great magnitude.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of an under-average even only ten percent, it was said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his government is closely watching the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals acclaimed: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic recognized two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals announced: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rabid black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian Serie A football league - and was really angry at the referee's video assistants.
"A festival not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so hard on a team," commented the Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples had gone through a goal by outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first praised the match.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the hit due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic threw the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) also took the referee's team back, according to the VAR.
In the aftermath, Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology ensures records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winners FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" after a short break and a few days of training, has to think about how he can transform his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich to have the third-most bet minutes, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to miss in crucial king-class duels.
In Munich’s muddy weather, the defender broke off a training game and was driven from the square with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth round back against FC Chelsea on August 8 is unlikely to be possible, for which the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
But the Bavarians don’t want to be stopped from training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on his way to the capital of Portugal.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show its winning titleholders in the next 28 days, ideally, until the Royals final on August 23.
"We have managed the responsibilities with the championship and the cup just excellently.
Now it’s time to create the special thing,” Flick said.
Until the Munichs can deal specifically with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, however, for the first time there is the eighth-final obligation against FC Chelsea.
After the 3:0 in the playoffs before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become the Bayern nightmare again as in the lost "finale dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and tank confidence with a good game,” Flick said.
A test for the match will be held on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in to a one-time August by his stars who had been on holiday after the Double 13 days.
31 players he welcomed on Siebener Straße, including the new players for the noble purchase Leroy Sané, who for the first time after his move from Manchester City met all new colleagues on the square.
"Like all the new ones, Leroy has made a good fit," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer only train, Flick talked much more about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, they are now trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are in rhythm unlike the Flick ensemble.
After that, the Munichs could have a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals are possible opponents of Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.
A road to the final in Lisbon "is not that easy", the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday, stressed.
The World Cup record shooter Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 agreement.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive feature of his team.
At the tournament with nine-teams, it was also an ambitious thing on Sunday.
All of the performers included Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the Royals season is not guaranteed.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to win its World Champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All U.S. races were cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o in Portugal will be held.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight on the Italian traditional track in Imola for World Cup points.
As a result, the 2020 race calendar comprises 13 runs according to current status.
“We are delighted that we will continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” Formula 1 boss Chase Carey said.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the royal class of motorsport will be completed in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, which were already officially scheduled in December, there could still be performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November, according to media reports.
Regulations Require Races on Three Continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are being driven, there should be a World Champion.
With a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing “extraordinary circumstances” due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be canceled in the short term due to the impending coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection hits criticism in Brazil
Due to the strained corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being with them again next season,” Carey said.
The cancellation of the Americas race was particularly critical in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to go to Brazil would also not justify a resignation.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s well-known latenight show via video and told in the interview what she had in mind during her meeting with Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular U.S. latenight show via video.
She spoke, among other things, of her struggle against the world’s powerful.
The teenager also spoke about her famous “bad look” at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known latenight show, she spoke about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at last year’s UN climate summit.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg into your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
“There are a few things that surprised me,” she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are going down the street,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who make fun of them on social media or even try to silence them find them “funny” as they show the reactions, “because they have no other answer to it.”
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter look at U.S. President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the actuator sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the U.S. president at that moment?
To the relatively open question asked by Stephen Colbert, she answered briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
With the ready-made answer, the experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected and disappeared briefly smiling from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder real estate with three-pack for Lazio Rome

Former Dortmund Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB-professional managed three hits in Lazio Rome's 5:1 (1:1) victory at Hellas Verona, including two converted elfmeters in the rematch of both halves.
With this, the 30-year-old from the table four games before the end of the season now has 34 season goals on his account - as many achieved by Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich in the last Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo is following with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that a further statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton hailed Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a “monumental loss” to all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the legendary band in London in 1967, and his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" remains unforgettable to this day.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is like an eighth track ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the group’s profits for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems have also played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
There followed a social downturn.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have occasionally lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in London’s Bethnal Green district.
From a young age, he became enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of 11, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing professional guitar and five years later was given the opportunity to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired to replace his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
Composed by Green, the song "Albatross" provided the group with the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadows: Green did not cope with the media rumble, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
By the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swims without him in a new formation on a success wave.
