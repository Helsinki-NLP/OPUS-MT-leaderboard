There are a lot of people who are worried about what they look like as a puppet.
Some deputies do not understand why their deputies' status should be changed to "Member of the Parliament of Wales".
The deputies were ashamed of plans to change the name of the local East to the "Parliament of Wales".
Some of the politicians of all political parties believe that this is a misconception.
One Labour MP said that his colleagues were concerned that it rhymed with the words “stupid” and “disgraceful.”
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means "dumb", and pwp means "dumb".
She said that she was not satisfied with the results and that she was looking for alternatives.
The Walloon Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss a change in the name of the East, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Walloon parliament to a "mariannetac".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is now working on a draft law on the amendment of the name, made a statement: “The final decision on any description of what the deputies of the East call will, of course, be a question of the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives East Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for calling the meeting the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of additional deputy, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament or the CNC, but the CUP option received the most support during the public consultations.
Additional MPs, of course, offer alternative options, but the way to reach a consensus could be a headache for the chairman, Ellen Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the changes over the course of a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as the rules on disqualification of additional MPs and changes in the structure of the committee system.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they are performing their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters voted to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of resolving a multi-year issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own territory under the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor constitutes a presumption on their territory, which has hampered Macedonia's inclusion in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is in favour of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that the name change is just a cost that needs to be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
St. Martin's Church Calls Quiet, Churches in Harlem Struggle for Existence
“Earlier, as the old people I talked to said, there was a bar and a church on each corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one or the other today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People have different relationships and relationships in the present time,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the cozy local living rooms, where people walk all the time.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets does not stop for as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by living houses with candamines, filled with people who will not help the temples that will remain in the area.
“The vast majority of residents who buy candamine in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so it will speed up the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that most of the people who come to these cans will come.”
Both churches were built by the white community before Harlem became a black area – the Church of St. Martin in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin – a decade later.
The first white-methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community, who prayed nearby, was given the right to own the building.
St. Martin's Church was captured by a dark-skinned public under the leadership of the late John Howard Johnson, who designated a boycott of merchants on the main shopping street in Harlem, 125th Street, where the blacksmiths were refused to hire or rent.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but the faithful under the leadership of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put the carillons into operation.
Like David Johnson, the son of his father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the carillon “the names of the poor people.”
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it otherwise: “Cultural Treasure” and “an indispensable historical tool”.
Tsifani Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black-skinned musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merivez said that he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a difficult story between architects and patrons, some of whom have been drawn to the false leaders of the church, others to the diocese.
The gathering of the faithful – the governing body of the arrival, which consists of the assistants of the chaplain – wrote to the diocese in July with a warning that the diocese “try to translate the expenses” into the gathering of the faithful, although the congregation did not participate in the hiring of the architects.
Some of the members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark was injured by a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who hunted for lobsters in California on the day of the opening season of the lobster hunt.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for half an hour when he heard the boy yelling, asking for help, and then swam with the rest to help you.
At first, Hamel thought it was just the excitement of hunting the lobbies, but then he “understood that something bad had happened: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
“His whole key was ripped off,” Hamel said, adding that he noticed it when he approached the boy.
I yelled at everyone to come out of the water, “In the water next to the shark!” added Hamel.
The boy was transported by air to the Reedy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The identity of the shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said on a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe diversion.
Giles added that the victims suffered injuries to the upper part of the body.
The protesters closed the approach to the beach from Punta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening beauty departments in workshops where trained specialists will work.
As part of a significant increase in the British beauty market with a turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashionable clothing and other household goods is also decreasing in the summer and summer season, larger beauty houses will be in the future.
Investments in the field of beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a spot on the shelves that have previously been occupied by TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of beauty goods by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
Existing assortments from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more place in the brand departments similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Huge stores are also relaunching their line of boutique cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming increasingly in demand among young buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test the concept in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Crawford in southern London, and the second will open in Selee Oak (Birmingham).
Buying online and switching to buying small quantities of products every day in local shops near the house leads to the fact that supermarkets have to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cooper, Sainsbury's CEO, said that the retail outlets will be increasingly similar to a department store, as a network of supermarkets are trying to compete with Aldi, Lidl's discounters with the help of a larger number of services and non-profits.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos trading points in hundreds of stores, and has also placed a few steps Habitats since two years ago when it acquired both networks, which, according to him, contributed to the growth of the sales of food and grocery products.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty and pharmacy departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to share revenue from pharmacies ended after a series of searches in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business three years ago along with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's pharmacy network for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It has been reported that Lloyds has played a role in this, expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Miles-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees, who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet any needs, and the attractive setting and convenient location make us a better home to beauty that resists the old fashioned way of shopping.”
Peter Jones resigned after Holly Willowby resigned from the <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal.
The Dragons star Peter Jones disbanded after television star Holly Willowby refused to trade 11 million pounds of sterling with his brand, which specializes in the image of the life of the Markcer and the I.S. to focus on his new canvas.
Willow doesn't have time for a brand of home goods and accessories Truly.
The couple's business became similar to the Guinness World Trade Center.
This morning, the 37-year-old leader announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now splitting up with her lucrative branding business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was upset when the "golden" girl of television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe. in a time of 1.5 years, the owner of the company was not a member of the company.
The business was similar to the Gwinnett Paltrow Goop brand and was doubled to double William's fortune by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her vacation homes.
The source said: "Indeed, it was Holly's main priority.
It's a long-term future that she'll see in a couple of decades.
The decision to withdraw from the meeting has left all the participants completely disheartened.
No one wanted to believe what was going on on Tuesday, very soon had to start lunch.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse, full of goods, ready for sale.
Experts believe that the care of the leading This Morning, which is among the most significant British stars, can cost the company millions due to huge investments in various goods - from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willowbi's mother and husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cape, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the post of chairman in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will become a representative of the M&S brand and replace Aunt McPartlin as the leading ITV “I’m Famous”.
Last night, a source close to Jones reported: “We will not comment on his case.”
Honest Conversation, “What We Fall In Love With”
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for his remarks, which he considered "non-presidential" for the fact that he spoke positively about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump have a lot of reluctance to do?
Trump told his paradoxical "dictatorial" voices.
“I don’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was announced by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Li Yong Ho said to the world leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not been expecting "appropriate steps" by the U.S. in response to the U.N.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic position in his speech.
“We are very successful in building a relationship with North Korea,” he said.
“It could have been the end of the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the completion of missile tests, aid in the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of U.S. troops to the home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about the relationship with Kim.
“To be on the side of the president is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we’ll already have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in India have devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake on V. Lambock, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lampoka were resettled, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for the provision of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it became clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it was a bit difficult,” she said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is also gathering a team to travel to Pal, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on the spots.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for Combating Disasters, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to find out if the international agency will be allowed to do so.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia has always been experiencing, the country is still well-prepared for the unfortunate nature.
Although there were shelters built in Aachen, in other coastal settlements they hardly have.
The apparent lack of gray to warn of a tsunami in Palo led to a greater number of victims, although the warning was.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia has been a difficult task.
Disasters have made it more difficult for us to move.
The hospital ship, which was located on Lambock to treat the victims of the earthquake, is approaching Pal, but the road to a new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joe Vidoda has focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure, and has spent money on highways and railroads, according to Reuters.
But the lack of funding is stalling the administration of Jack, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joka is also faced with the pressure of prolonged inter-confessional tensions in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority accept more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs were white in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starge of Liverpool throws the ball away against Chelsea <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from Chelsea's loss in the Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
The old man got a transmission from Jordan Shakira when they were about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goal, which led to a score of 1-0.
He made the finnish ball to the left of himself before making a shot at the far bar.
The attempt ended by hitting high under the top bar when the ball flew to the top right corner of the net.
As a result, the ball flew over the head of Kepa Arisibalagi, which jumped directly into the net.
“He was just trying to get into this position to push the ball, and players like Shack were always trying to push as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible,” Starge said in an interview with Liverpool.
“I saw Conte running, I made a light pass, not thinking too much about it, and I just hit the ball.”
Chelsea scored 1-0 at the start of the second half after Belgian star Eden Azar was killed in the 25th minute.
Attacking the "blue" in this match made pass Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, before returning to the zone of the semi-defense and running into the half field of "Liverpool".
The squirrel quickly found himself in the center of the field.
Then he made a powerful blow, handing the ball over to Azar at the gate.
Azar ran over the defender and punctured in the lower left corner near the long bar after Liverpool goalkeeper Elisan Becker.
“Liverpool” competes with “Napoli” in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 o’clock on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo stadium in Italy’s Naples.
Chelsea meet with Videathon in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of tsunami in India has increased to 832
The death toll from earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the agency said on Sunday morning it had eliminated the aftermath of natural disasters.
At a press conference, the representative of the agency Sutopa Purvo Nugroha said that according to the reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake had a magnitude of 7,5 points, which occurred in the rain.
The city of Palu, which is home to more than 380,000 people, has been dormant with the ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The investigation into the murder began after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Mercyside) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with acute injuries in the Grayson-Mouse area on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area to speak to them, who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or who has seen or heard something suspicious, and they'll fix it.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers, video recorders who may have taken some video, to contact us, as they may have information that is of paramount importance to our investigation."
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living next to Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today, the women's friends came to the scene to ask: where was she found this morning?
Investigations are ongoing, and the police said they were in the process of informing the victims' closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told it will take a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
The police have explained to one man that the whole area is now a crime scene, and that the whole area is a crime scene.
The woman was crying at the scene of the incident.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating the multi-apartment building.
Anyone with information should contact the <0x40>MerPolCC Police Department, call 101, or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, calling record 247 as of September 30.
The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell became the last century-old hit in the case of “rewriting history”.
His removal would be a poetic justice for him similar to the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, done by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “stupidity” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the course of the current debate on the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell memorial near Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
The vivid representation of Mr. William Ham Thorncroft on Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century thought and part of the actor's historiography, which, as many believe, needs to be enshrined to date.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “The Cromwell has been known by many since the end of the 19th century better than it is today, as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of long-standing historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual cognitive figure that represents one of the sides of this confrontation.
His accomplishments as a Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and honoured by them.”
The pig-killer was killed before the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by pork on the market in the south-western part of China.
“The man, known only by his nickname, Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery and smeared blood, near the bread market in Lupanshui in Guiji province,” the South Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
The pig was preparing to introduce the pig vaccine in a pigstore in China on May 30, 2005, in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
It is reported that he and his cousin on Wednesday came from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring pork shop had been opened.
He said that there was a big blood clot in the pork chop.
According to the report, the forensic and medical examination confirmed that the 550-pound squid dehumanized the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were swollen and damaged,” said a cousin named Wu (according to the Guiyang Evening News quote).
A video from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police gathered evidence at the scene of the incident.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs are attacked by humans, they are rare, but they have been in the past.
So, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, as a result of which the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound-weight pig pushed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and held it so until his wife let the animal go.
After a farmer from the state of Arizona was eaten up by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a droplet.
“They’re just goosebumps.
They're so cute and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rose is weaker as it moves over colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, “Rosa” will receive flooding in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
The velocity of the Roses, a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form an area of low pressure, moving eastwards, to the west coast of the United States. If on Monday the "Rose" peak is approaching the westwards the coast of the peninsula of Lower California, it is in the form of a trench.
On Monday, "Rosa" will take to some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches of precipitation.
Then the tropical humidity, which interacts with the incoming low-pressure area, in the coming days will cause strong limestones in the south-west.
In places ranging from 1 to 4 inches of rainfall cause dangerous sudden floods, rural floods and possible subsidences in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to the fact that the amount of precipitation in places will reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona. (wikipedia.org)
In some areas of the northwest, especially in most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of precipitation is expected.
Due to the grouped areas of tropical rains, sudden flooding is possible, provided the conditions deteriorate rapidly.
It would be very undesirable to go on foot into the desert because of the possibility of a threat of tropical fallout.
Heavy rains can lead to canyons turning into turbulent rivers, and rain will be accompanied by steamy winds and dust.
The incoming low-pressure area will receive heavy rains in a part of the coast of Southern California, according to the report.
Possible total damage to more than half of the road can lead to a slight flow of debris and make the roads slippery.
This will be the first of July in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and the beginning of Monday, before the rain will go everywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be severe temperature fluctuations in the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
At times, this can lead to a sharp change in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of the sharp temperature fluctuations in the central part of the U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahai, Nebraska, St. Louis, and De Moyne, Iowa, the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the heat of the summer will try to intensify and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states of the United States, October will start warm with temperatures of 80 degrees – from the South Plains to part of the North East.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have been watching Bret Kavanaugh's speech.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched interesting testimony on Thursday in the Supreme Court in the case between Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, according to the BBC.
Meanwhile, the political opposition continues, broadcasters interrupted their regular programs in favor of the extraordinary news on Friday: an agreement drafted by the Arizona senator's report to the U.S. Senator Jeff Flick for the FBI: it was in the right place.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 per cent sure that Kawana's drunks grabbed her and tried to pull her off her dress at a high school dinner.
Kavanaugh said in his testimony that he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, about whom Nielsen reported on Friday, watched it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that demonstrated this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen's company, there are usually problems with the assessment of people who watch TV in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in a playoff or an Oscar award.
“Fox News, whose experts strongly supported Kavan’s appointment, controlled all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,” Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million,” Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest after the hearings.
Flake was the main character of the drama on Friday.
After a moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters shouted at his address at the rally, and when he tried.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes when he was being sung, and it was broadcast live on the CNN channel.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said to him, “You have power, but many women have been deprived of it.”
Flake said his office had published the statement, and informed him before the elevator closed that he had more to say at the hearings in the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks have been broadcasting live for several hours, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on the issue of the selection of Kavanaugh's candidacy during the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI will consider the accusations against the candidate next week, something Democrats from the minority are calling for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Senator-Democratic Chris Kunsam.
After a discussion with Kunsam and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flick's election was in place because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has begun an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh at the FBI.
U.K. Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of 'Play in Politics' Over Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
During an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of planning to leave the European Union that they are "playing politics" with the future of Britain and disrupting national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018. . . .
In one of the interviews next to her on the front page of the newspaper was her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson, who spoke out against her so-called "shameful" Brexit plan, stating that the Brexiteers were not "proposed to the UK and the EC to vote".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police have arrested the suspect in the death of LSU player Diane Simpson.
Police have arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
“20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and placed in prison on charges of second-degree murder,” the police directorate of Baton Rouge said in a statement.
Officers showed a video of the shooting between Sam and Simpson, and police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the interception.
“Police took the eyeglasses from the scene and said that Simpson’s DNA was found on them,” said WAFB, a branch of CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to a fatal shooting in Wade.
“The cost of the bet is set at the level of $350,000,” – reports Advocate.
The Eastern Batan-Ruja investigation published a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck, according to Reuters.
The department of the Louisiana State Police Operations Group, the state police criminal laboratory, and the Southern University police are asking the residents of the area to assist in an investigation that would contribute to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Aliyev, thanked the district’s law enforcement authorities for “the antiquity and the pursuit of justice.”
Sam was only 20 years old.
Attacking 6 feet tall, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
On average last season, he scored 5.6 points, 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the Louisiana University basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was “destroyed” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
“That’s what I’m always worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico
The ash, erupted by the Papacatepetl volcano, has reached the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Alerts on Saturday proposed to Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater became active and 183 cases of gas and pedal emissions were recorded within 24 hours.

Images on social networks have shown that in the vicinity of Mexico, such as Sacimilka, there are thin layers of apricot coating on the car windscreen.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the southeastern capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goi, has been active since 1994.
Conflict of police with Catalan separatists on the eve of the year of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after supporters of independence clashed with police for the protection of public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstrators in the first year of the policing process, according to a press release.
A group of masked separatists, who were held by police for the protection of public order, dropped them with eggs and blossomed with powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tours.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their dubs to detain the protesters.
For several hours, a group of independence fighters who chanted “Don’t forget, don’t give up” came across a group of trade unionists who shouted, “Long live Spain.”
According to local media reports, fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries received during the protests, according to the Ministry of Health.
Tensions in the region, which is seeking independence, remain high a year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which was noted by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters preferred independence, although the voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of the demonstrators in the region.
The pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to avert demonstrations in support of Spain's national police force.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to go a different route.
Narcissis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is present at the separatist protest along with his wife, said he no longer trusts the prospects of Catalonia's independence.
“We’ve had one of the best moments in the summer.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we’re tired,” he said.
Despite the vital but minor victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, who are in favour of independence, from all sides, have been trying to keep the momentum out of the brink this year, with many of their most loyal supporters.
The 42-year-old mechanic Jean-Puc, who recorded a protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict had been reported by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting tougher,” he said.
Ariel Junkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the CISA since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will participate in elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Employment as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
LONDON: Men arrested after smuggling a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car crashed into a house in London on a number of occasions.
The incident took place in the Belingard-Kresent area on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a bullet was fired into the car.
As a result of the strike of Mang "Livingstan" gets victory over "Rangers" with a score of 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mangi in favor of "Livingstan" provided them with a victory
The success of "Livingstane" devastated the Rangers, and it caught up to appoint Steven Jared after his several defeats in 18 games to the position of manager of the club Ibrox.
Dolly Mangi's hit was excellent, as Gary Holt climbed to one level with the Hibernians in the second division.
Gerard's team won't win the Premier League this season and will meet with the leaders of the Harts team next Sunday, who are behind by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers in the Europa League will receive on Thursday a win "Rapid".
Livingston, meanwhile, has continued its unbeaten series in the division up to six games, and head coach Holt is still feeling the defeat after the replacement of Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstan" misses chances because of the rough visitors
Holt's team had to warn long before they were killed, but the same direction caused the Rangers to face a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson failed, but lost his chance to kill in the gate, after which Alan Litgov was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halket's blow.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers walk in front of them, knowing that they could bother the guest at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
The Rangers were allowed a penalty kick, and Livingston made the debut, Declan Galaher and Robinson teamed up to beat Meng, who made a pass and killed from the center of the field.
Up to this point, the Rangers dominated, but it turned out that the team's defense was useless, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually unaffected.
The same continued in the second half, although Alfredo Marelas really saved Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pitman was beaten by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov went a long way from the second set of Liverpool.
The balls were constantly hit at the Liverpool gate and were eliminated, while the two demands for a penalty, after Calcutta was called in to replace Glenn Middleton, and the demand for a penalty for playing with the hand, were rejected.
"Phenomenon" from "Livingstan" – analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alesdeir Lamant on the arena Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal performance and results for "Livingston".
For the men, they were wonderful, continuing to surpass expectations on this emerging trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since their return to the upper chessboard, but it is worth giving Holt the proper for how he stimulated the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Chalket was grandiose, building a well-organized defense, while Meng was holding Conor Goldson and Joe Waral all over the field.
The Rangers didn’t get any inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Gerard's, they didn't meet this standard.
In the last game, they didn't own the ball, only once by shooting in the goal, which was something like a worrying call for the Rangers, which were in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude towards Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there was a smile and a sense of groundless flight when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO's allies.
They fought over the problems of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdogan has moved to Cologne to open a new gigantic ball.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish populations outside of Turkey.
Police rescued on security measures to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from rallying in front of the ball, but a lot of supporters gathered nearby to see their president, according to Reuters.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their views, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
Protests for and against the protests show a variety of views on a guest, whom some German Turks declared a hero and others condemned as an autocrat.
DTS in Deptford: Ravarist killed in collision with car
The driver was killed in a car crash in London, England.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Beaver Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 p.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped, medical workers arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred months after another rower was killed as a result of a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said that their employees are working on identifying the person and informing him of his or her closest relatives.
Near the place there are road fences and bus stops, and the drivers were advised to avoid the area in the area.
Long-Larcin Prison: Six Employees Injured During Disturbances
“Six prison officials were injured as a result of riots in the prison of strict regime for men,” the Penitentiary Order reports.
The riots erupted in Long Larcin Prison in Vussardyra at around 09:30 British time on Sunday and continue to this day.
To combat the disorder, in which the eight captives in one wing are involved, the special group "Tarnada" was drawn.
At the scene of the incident, the staff were treated for minor injuries.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel were directed to fight those who committed riots in the Long Larcin prison.
Six of the patients were discharged after they had been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Larcin Royal Prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was undergoing treatment in the hospital after the attack on the prisoner.
And in October of last year, police officers for the protection of public order were called to prison to deal with serious riots, during which employees were subjected to attacks with balls for the water polo.
Hurricane Rose threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with heavy flooding (which may be beneficial for dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week, because traces of hurricane "Rose" remain in the southwestern part of the desert, which pose a risk to the desert.
The National Meteorological Service has released data on sudden flooding in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, Southwestern Texas, and Southwestern California, and Utah, including on Monday and Tuesday. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is expected that on Tuesday, "Rose" will go straight through the Phoenix, approaching with the rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts a fall of 2 to 4 inches, while in separate locations the level can reach 6 inches in the Magallane region of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-western desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual result values up to 4 inches.
For those who are beyond the limits of the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rose could be long-term, because their region is suffering from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these incidents are likely to be beneficial, as droughts are currently observed in the south-western part of the country.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring agency, at least a little more than 40 percent of the territory of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought of the second category,” according to weather.com.
First of all, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to subsidences in the Mexican peninsula of Southern California.
On Sunday morning, Rose continued to have the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore is silent.
As a result, it is expected that in Mexico, in the event of a tropical storm, the exit of rivers from the coasts will take place in the day or in the evening on Monday.
Accidents in different parts of Mexico can be severe, which poses a significant risk of drowning.
“A total of 3 to 6 inches of precipitation is expected from Southern California to northwestern Sunrise, where possible precipitation is up to 10 inches,” reports weather.com.
"The Rose" will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical drop in pressure, which will then continue to move through the Arizona and the southern hemisphere.
“The main danger is expected from the Rose or its remains, it is very heavy rains in Southern California and in the northwestern Sanora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” the National Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rural streams and floods in the mountainous region.
Assassination of Midsomer Norton: Four Attempts to Detain Assassin's Creed
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple acute injuries in Summersett.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Teresa Excelsior area of Midsummer North at about 4 p.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in a “stable” condition.
“The 17-year-old boy and two others, aged 18 or 20, were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Summerset area,” police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on their mobile phone of what had happened to advance further in their quests.
“Cavano is agitated by the subjugation and anger of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the abolition of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "suffering from debauchery and anger" by the Democratic Party in the process of his resignation.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blaise Ford that he had sexually assaulted her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony during the hearings on her indictment.
On Saturday, the President said that “on this day, the Americans saw the brilliant, quality and brave character” of Cavano.
“The voice in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president quickly resigned from Kavanaugh's election, talking about the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the interim elections.
“We have five weeks left to one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not just late, I’m really late,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to “oppose and impede.”
“It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level on the withdrawal of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday,” the senior deputy head of parliament told CNN.
Hundreds of people died as a result of earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims aged
“At least 384 people were killed, many people disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when a wave of six meters (18 feet) high waved white on the beach in the trenches, killing many to death and destroying everything on its way.
After a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, a tsunami occurred.
“When a tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they became victims,” the Indonesian State Emergency Relief Agency’s spokesperson for Nuurto Ppo told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami dragged the cars, the beards, the houses, hitting everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km / h (up to 497 miles / h) before the impact on the coastline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed up trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres of Palu.
The aerial photographs, published by the emergency disaster agency, showed that many of the buildings and the store were destroyed, the masts turned and collapsed, and the ball was surrounded by water.
Subsequent raids continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technologies (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday is about 200 times greater than the power of an atomic bomb dropped on Hirasim in Surat.
According to him, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage "widely" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without a sign.
"The damage and damage may be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Pola, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," Nugroha said.
The connection in Dongal “was completely damaged,” Nugroh said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers were sent to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting on the tsunami in Palo, but officials say the waves came at a time when a warning was made.
In the amateur photos, published on social networks, you can hear a man on the top floor of the building desperately yelling at people on the street to warn of an impending tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the shore, dragging buildings and cars behind them.
Reuters has not been able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious shutdown of electricity, which disrupted communications around the Pole, so it was difficult for the authorities to recall rescue actions.
According to the authorities, the military began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still very much needed food and other items of first need.
The city's airport was only open for assistance and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joe Vida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palo.
As a result of the tsunami in India, more than 800 people were killed.
It's very bad.
“While World Vision employees from Danghala successfully arrived in the city of Palo, where workers are hiding in the ice rinks installed in the courts of their office, along the way they saw the scenes of the shooting,” Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he told me.
It's very bad.
Even though aid groups have started slurring actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some have complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge are barred from going to the Pole. . . .
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to enter the country if the place of disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Oulia Arryiani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government declares, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to open up for international aid, but this status is not yet available.
On the second night in Palo, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing without news hoped that their near miracle would be among those who would leave the unfortunate storylines of the dire misery.
On Saturday, the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Gendon Subandona, coach of the Indonesian national paraplanning team, has prepared two of the missing paraplanes for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, were his disciples.
“As an elder in the field of paraplannerism, I have my own emotional weight,” he said.
Mr. Hendon said that a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paraplanetist community, he was desperate to send messages in WhatsApp to a participant of the Palu.
His messages, however, were marked with a single gray halacha, not two blues.
“This means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling ATMs in Newport on Levi
“On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who put in bills at an ATM in Newport, Libya,” the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
“The driver of the car crashed the ATM in the entertainment complex and was ready to deliver more money,” Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was busy, another man "runned out of the employee of Brink" and stole the fur with the money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noted several suspects who had left the scene of the incident, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kane West: The rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I'm officially known as Kane West.
West, who is 41, by the name of Ye, used this name as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande with a show that was cancelled for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Along with the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious significance for him.
I believe that “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s name with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So I’m you, I’m you, I’m you, I’m you, I’m you
It went from “Kaney” which means “the one” to “just Ye” – a reflection of our good, our bad, our destruction, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but that year announced that he was inclined to the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's co-worker, Jay-Z, also went unaffiliated and headlined.
AMLO in Mexico vows not to use the army against the peaceful inhabitants of the country
Mexico's President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez Abrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the country is approaching its 50th anniversary since the day of the bloody repression.
On Saturday, at Tlatelolco Plaza L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador promised "never to use scouts to bribe the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the military abstracted a peaceful demonstration on the square, which resulted in the deaths of about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were carried out throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to learners, thus opening up more free-to-use places at state-run universities.
“Unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to the criminal groups,” he said.
The U.S. should double its funding for machine intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount they spend on research in this field,” said Apple, an investor and a specialist in machine intelligence at Microsoft, LTU.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
In the meantime, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, it will aim to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
“The budget for research in the MI area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States, and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in the MI area,” Lee said.
“The lapse of funding could double the likelihood that the next major achievement of MI will be achieved in the U.S.,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Machine Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order" was published this month by Houton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Company <0x2B> The Company is the CEO of the company, Innovation Ventures.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Melano, he worked on a machine-intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American player Atel, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google China.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government's technological competitions, such as the Agency's robotics competition for an advanced research project in the field of defense, and asked if there would be a next one to help identify the following.
“U.S. investigators often have to do a lot of work to get state grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired candles from universities to work on MI.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
“I think green cards should automatically be offered to a candidate in the field of MI,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released a plan for the development of the next generation of machine intelligence.
“China’s National Science Foundation is providing funding to people in educational institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other state-owned organizations are donating money to the U.S.-based researchers,” said the U.S. National Science Foundation.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a United Center for Machine Intelligence, in which industry and scientific circles partners should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on the subject.
And this month, the Agency for an advanced research project in the field of defense announced about investments in the amount of $2 billion under the name AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not monitored the actions for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on renaming the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on changing their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which will allow to resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications for participation in the European Union.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a pretension to its territory, and has vetoed the accession of NATO and the EC.
In June, the two governments signed a deal to take into account the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgiy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether the voter turnout would correspond to the minimum of 50 percent required to hold the referendum.
The question of voting in the referendum proposes: “You are in favor of NATO and EC membership with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece”.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is a cost that is worth paying for admission to such bodies as the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Sorkoev, 79.
While this is not a mandatory legal force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that the notifications of violations were not received by 1 hour of the day.
However, the polls accounted for only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Skopje-based voter Joeze Tanevski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritza and his son Dushka voted in a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the name of the country, which will open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in 2018.
Before the building of the parliament in Skopje Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want unity with raised heads, not through the official doors,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have an honor.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zayev said that NATO's partnership will take the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, according to the report.
“I think the overwhelming number will be ‘for’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO,” Zayev said after the vote.
He said that the result of “yes” will be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia says that the referendum will involve 30 to 43 percent of the voters, which is below the required ovum, in a poll.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian television channel, showed 57 percent of the respondents who plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they voted “yes.”
In order for a successful referendum to be held, there must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western government's policy since its inception in May last year.
Watch: Sergei Aguera from Manchester City passes to the gate across the entire "Britan" defense
On Saturday, Sergei Aguerre and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending against Brighton by winning Manchester City 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguerre easily did it.
The Argentine attackers got a pass in the center of the field.
He tried between the three defenders of the Brighton, before hitting the open field.
At the time, Aguera was among the four green coughs.
He went over to one defender and stabbed several others on the edge of the Britannic field.
He then shoved a pass on the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking first touch in the penalty handed the ball to Aguerre, who used his right-handed kick to beat Brightan's goalkeeper Mattia Ryan by punching in the right-hand side of the net.
“Aguera has some problems with the legs,” Pep Guardiola, the head of the city, told reporters.
“We talked about how he played for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at the same time.”
But it was Serling who gave Sky Blues the first lead in the fight in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguera got this ball in the depths of the territory of Brightana.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Seen made a few holes before Sterling was able to reach the long bar.
Attacking "Sky Blues" pointed the ball into the net before he jumped over the border.

Scherzer wants to play the role of "collection points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from play-off competitions, there was no special reason to diversify the new start.
But consistently competitive Shercer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the Rocky Mountains, but only if there are still play-off consequences for the Rocky Mountains, which remain in the lead after a single game with Loss.
The Rockies won, at least, a single place with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even though we're just playing like that, at least we can handle the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and the other team that is going to be with this team is going to be such that the game is probably going to be at its highest.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer the ball in such a situation.
Shercer, who was going to make his 34th start, held a session of the KPZ on Thursday and will be on Sunday on a regular vacation.
Washington's straight 18/07 with 2.53 ERA and 300 cars in 220 2/3 draws this season.
Trump is in the West of Virginia.
The president quickly revisited the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court of Britt Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is in jeopardy in November.
It's five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not late, but I’m really late, so I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that it’s happening right now.
And they are full of resolves to return to power, using any necessary means, you see, – subjugation, greed.
"They don't care who they're covering, who they have to beat to get power and control, it's what they want, it's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to him, the Democrats intend to “oppose and impede.”
“And you’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, ugly, reversible, and lying.”
He appealed to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the prior recognition of the Senator of the Democratic group, Diane Feynstein, who received a loud applause from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
You've let the document go?
Uh, what.
No, I don’t expect it – it was a very bad nonverbal language – the worst language I’ve ever seen.”
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
This is an impatience for those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted for me to hurt, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a series of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party, who are told that we are not welcome – everything to express their opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar appeal, because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship exposed me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony of fate, there are similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, states that “we want these meetings to be locally and productively organized.”
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party, these meetings were held on Friday.
Unfortunately, today in most meetings the tone is not the same and the promise of a “better, softer” policy has long been forgotten, when indeed there has ever been.
It is becoming increasingly evident that in the Labour Party different views are not allowed, and each opinion is evaluated from the point of view, whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, because the colleagues with whom I had previously believed that I shared the same political views began to expect me to take a step back, and they took positions with which I would not be able to take a step back.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is a tyranny of resentment on social media that calls for the abolition of elections, condemning the center’s politics, saying that I am no longer in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I've been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me, as a rule, are political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racist depravities, but never relentlessly.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuses.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerantness.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that adheres to different views, and with each movement of “uncertainty” or a change in the rules of selection of the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice that asked me not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, reported by the excavation of the Thatcher government, because of which my education in the school has been poorly or poorly, I have tried to withstand the best of state services.
I've never been a fan of my own political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could have been confused in my political stances and areas of disagreement with the current leadership at the time.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is heading for a Brexit that is damaging to the homeowner, business and our public service, I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my constituents, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise you I won't be threatened by the abolition of the elections.

Air Melrose 38 - 17: The Invincible Air at the Top
Two later attempts may have resulted in a few final results, but, without a doubt, Aire deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match of Tennant's Premier League.
Now they are designing the tournament table, one side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances that made them their hosts, coach Peter Darky Morch had the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve still tried our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said, "Give what is due to Eyre, he's braver than we are."
The 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Clima, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, did not allow Melrose to juggle numbers and j.
The climes stretched the leadership of the Air with the help of a penalty, before, just in the break, he killed, and then triggered a solo attempt, making 17-5 Air in the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, converted by Bagot, shortened the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a severe injury to Ruaryd Not, which was extended, and after a reboot, Air advanced further through Stafford McDowell's attempt at the Climates.
Air, fulfilling Captain Blair Macferson's duties, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with the help of Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of February pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting the Climbs without a ball from the penalty line, Macferson landed behind Aire.
The climes realised their attempt, which he did again almost after the restart, after Kyle Rowe got a blow from David Armstrong in the penalty and sent flanker Gregory Henry on the fifth attempt by the hosts of the field.
The star still game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the game's star Ford Kieran is going to enter the hospitality industry after it turns out that he was appointed by the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he writes, and is filming alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the show series, and it seems that Cornann is planning to act further after Craigling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Cornann hoped to take part in the "April trade in Glasgow".
“Our Sea”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Moroccans patrol the Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
Buildings under the blue flag of the city.
In the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "The sea is ours on the right" is painted.
Renewing is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chili in the bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century, still alive – as well as the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached a peak in the last decade, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of deliberation.
“Balivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive outcome,” said the Bolivian diplomat, Rabert Kalsadylya.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague after decades of tense negotiations will support the statement of the delegation of Bolivia that Chile is obliged to negotiate.
Eva Marales is a charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces a conflicting fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that's little to change, even if it does.
The Netherlands-based United Nations does not have the right to make a decision on Chile's territory, and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final arguments have been considered indicates that the case was “not difficult,” said the Chilean expert in the field of international law Paz Zarate.
And by far not promoting the affairs of Bolivia, it may have been rejected by the last four years.
“The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration,” Sarat said.
According to her, Marales's military rhetoric has lost the remaining Chilean benevolence.
"Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that, it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged letters.
Former President Eduardo Radr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will take Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of the 139 years has reconciled with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Marales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – had used the maritime problem as a political apology.
"Balivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
"North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the U.S.," he said.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can be trusted by Washington's government.
He made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the United States.
His comments come like the U.S.. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of resuming a nuclear-touched diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ry says it’s an “indispensable dream” that the continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the war in Korea will ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Pyongyang doesn't begin to take significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is great scepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness in rejecting the arsenal that the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows, we've seen the latest line in massive headwear on the way to the store in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the podium a number of unusual headwear for their SS19 collection, which exceeded expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram gained popularity with impractical hats, the designers of which sent their creations to the stage.
A notable feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige hood, decorated with wide fields, similar to pears, which filled the heads of models.
Other extraordinarily large-sized accessories included precious stones decorated with cabbage, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple, but they weren't designed to keep the head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a selection of wisel masks – just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were with stitched lips and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecturer than high fashion.
One of them resembled a cradle for underwater swimming with tubes and protective glasses, and the other - similar to a melted cone of ice cream.
And if you continue to stick to the huge attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Those who follow the style predict that huge caps can break through into our everyday lives. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The large hats go on the heels to "La Bomba", a straw hat with two-foot-wide fields that can be seen in all, from Riana to Emily Rataykovsky.
The iconic label on the very inconvenient hat, which was disbanded in social networks, matched to another great creation on the podium – a salami beach bag, almost as large as a model with this bag.
The dark-orange shelf bag, decorated with shelf trim and covered with a white leather handle, became a highlight of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armittedge said FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer had a big influence, and it would be difficult to ignore the demand for unsafe water".
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools maintain achievements in academic success, it has continued since 2018 with yet another excellent result of the exams, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and more.
More than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, the schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide a better level of work for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for the further higher education they have chosen for their careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desirable subject in schools. -
Nelson Mandela said, “When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it’s in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
It's a vivid reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we see that languages rank first in the league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a higher A-scoring rating.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grades A in Chinese language learning, while 72 percent were also from Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, and Aguascalientes.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills, which will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future, according to the BBC.
Now languages as a subject are chosen in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and in other places.
A survey conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons that employers have led to difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 per cent have been linked to shortcomings.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity in order to prepare young people for the future of their careers.
Given the more promising jobs that require language proficiency, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world. -
No matter which profession you choose when you learn a different language, it will be a real advantage in the future if you will have such skills for the rest of your life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put the multilingual person in the first place among the competitors. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to a YouGov survey, which involved more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language in which a two-digit 15 percent spoke.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for today's children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in it.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff who are specialists in the field. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to achieve success, regardless of what will happen in the future. . . .
At the present time, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as “skills of international relations.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and advantage to the youth of Scotland.
It's got to be done

LeBron will debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The start of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing at a pre-season opening on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's going to walk, we still have to figure out.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Waltan said on the Lakers website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudeau wrote that James is likely to play in a limited amount of minutes.
According to the practice that took place this week, James was asked about his plans for "six pre-season game schedules."
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
The time of Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a number of campaign campaigns.
It's the first of five Trump's scheduled speeches next week, including stops at friendly venues, Tennessee and Mississippi.
While confirming the vote to arrive at the election to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to strengthen support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the country.
When will Trump's performance begin tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it on the Internet?
Trump's performance in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia on the Internet below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week's candidacy hearing in the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh, who has a problem with allegations of sexual harassment with the Senate's expected confirmation of a vote for a week.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to the Republicans, who are facing the election in November.
Thus, the company of President Trump has announced that these five speeches in the next week are aimed at "activating the activity of volunteers and supporters", as the majority of the Republicans have been trying to defend and expand. . . .
“Control for Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as we are entering the tense season of the pre-election campaign,” the company’s spokesperson told Reuters.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Wylling, today’s action could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media in Pittsburgh,” The West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is a leader in the polls, to run for president.
“This is not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Hedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Rider Cup: The U.S. team is advancing to the fight to preserve hope for life on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions on Saturday, the four-day event may have been exactly what was needed for this Rider Cup.
The pulse that is moving is a fully devised sporting concept that the players sincerely believe in, and there is nothing more than competitions like this.
So, where would they say the momentum now?
“They had an advantage with six points, and now four, so I think we’re going to go through it with a little pulse,” said Jordan Sleepy, walking through the day.
Europe's advantage, of course, is four points ahead, and there are twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spitch says, feel that they've had a light breeze, and they have something to hope for, not least, because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who've been playing together all day, and everyone can smell.
"Spytt has been deadly from football to green and is an example.
These golden screams of celebration became increasingly loud as his round lasted, and he hit a decisive blow to play in a match on four pitches when they and Thomas went down two by two.
His blow, which allowed them to win the match of the 15th, was met with a similar scream, like the one that tells you that he believes the American team is not excluded.
“You just have to go deep and worry about your own match,” Spices said.
All of these players are already gone.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, the only players who have gained more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Malinara and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange, but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
Maliwood was the only couple that didn't make the gods on Saturday, the second half of the day, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and the second half of the day on Friday.
This is happening, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this stormy crowd, and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more of a golf club than a popular golfer to close the potential win at the event.
They are both available at the same time in different locations.
The discussion of European fame is still too early to take place.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief work on Sergei Garcia, the hero of the morning furseth, when he was in pairs with Alex Noren.
Boggi and two duels on the front nine threw out a Spaniard and a Swede, from whom they were never able to get out.
On Sundays, no one will be able to help you with your lunar eclipse.
After four-ball and four-ball matches, it's so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the composition of pairs, the parades they give, the parades they don't perform, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far become the best team and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but at this fourth meeting it is also shown that the U.S. team is striving to fight, in which some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe to reach the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a good lead on the last day of the Rider Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Malinara, the duo set out to fight with two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bourne's European side, trying to save the trophies they lost at Hazelcin two years ago, dominated the U.S. agency's dissatisfaction in the morning, receiving a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in a four-ball game, winning two games, but they couldn't do more.
To save the trophy, Jim Furyck's side needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, and he and the Malinars, who got the name Molliwood after the sensational outings, are only the second pair to win the Rykes in a row.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they struggled wonderfully to beat the sluggish Woods and American striker Brian DeCambo for another 5 and 4.
Woods, who led himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random burst of shine, but now he lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-ball and seven-round matches.
Justin Rose, who rested on the x four-ball game, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the four-ball game before the 2nd & 1 Daisy Johnson and Brooks Coopkey – occupying one and the second place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west from Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time main winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for the Americans by two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Rama and Ian Pulter from Spain in four-ball games and returned later to beat Puller and Rory McKillar 4 and 3 in the fourth, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cup, the Ryder team has returned from a four-point deficit, which goes into solitary, although in the side of the owners of the Fury you only need to paint to save the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which seemed to be the best, Sunday's counterattack looks like they're getting it all.
North Korea Says "No Way" Will Be Disarmed in One-Way Order Without Trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations is continuing sanctions that increase distrust of the United States, and under such conditions, the country can't give up its nuclear weapons on a one-sided basis.
Yun Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that last year North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill," such as a halt to nuclear tests on nuclear and missile sites and the dismantling of nuclear weapons.
“But we don’t see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way of disarming itself in the first place.”
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to the "step-by-step" approach to nuclear disarmament, in the context of which North Korea has not been rewarded for what it has done, because it has taken steps.
Ri said in a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the path to the "nuclearization of Korea" by Trump.
North Korea is trying to formally end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call for the abolition of tough international sanctions against North Korea, which is a major step forward.
“The United States of America first insists on ‘denuclearization’ and increasing the level of pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the ‘announcement of the end of the war.’”
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an indispensable dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party had been a participant in this issue, the question of non-nuclearization would not have been the case.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed sharply from last year, when he spoke to the UN General Assembly asserted that targeting the U.S. Continent with the help of the Tsipras' North Korean missiles was unavoidable after the "Mst."
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking action on disarmament, but said that there will be a lot more to be done, and sanctions will be imposed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are debating at the UN. The Security Council said that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary. Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be actively and necessarily continued until we can be sure of the full, final and final outcome of the meeting.”
The Security Council intensified sanctions against North Korea in 2006, in an attempt to halt the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the halls of the Security Council. The General Assembly then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has been unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea over the course of several hours of talks ended with a statement to the visa that he presented the demands “like gangsters.”
At a meeting with Munam this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile installation and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
Trump said that Kim said the “appropriate measures” he expected were a guarantee of security and an effort to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump had promised in Singapore.
Harvard's students are taking a course on the right vacation.
The new Harvard University course this year is to teach students to sleep more, and aims to compete with the culture of studying at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly care for themselves and their health.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by the impact of sleep deprivation on education, he started the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached me and said, “Why did you tell me this only now, in the last course of study”?
“She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep – it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course, presented to students, explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve the overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health care, said the university had decided to introduce a course after discovering that the students were often taken care of.
The course, which lasts one hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of the room on the internet, where students press on cups of coffee, curtains and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how a lack of sleep affects the mood, as well as the importance of the mood.
At an advanced stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive drawings, invites the participants to think about their everyday lives.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they need to know this as well as everyone knows about the health consequences of smoking,” Professor Chaisler added.
According to him, the culture of dinners continues to exist, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which is becoming a growing problem.
“Ensuring enough good quality sleep should be the ‘secret weapon’ of the students to combat stress, debilitation and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid overweight,” as the deprivation of sleep can be avoided.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request to all aspirants to complete a similar program of study before entering the university.
Professor Chassler advised students to set up a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, realizing the harmful effects of the "blue light" that is emitted by the light emitted from the screens of monitors and LED lights.
"Livingstan" 1:0 "Rangers": Menga kills Gerardo's goal.
The Rangers suffered another injury when Dolly Mangi's goalkeeper convinced that Steven Jared would not get a 1-0 injury at the Liverpool Stadium.
Ibrahim wants to record his first win on the way to a 4-1 victory in St. John's in February, but Gary Holtan's team is already taking a second defeat to Jared as manager of the Lions' 18-game Hedbroke to leave La Paz behind eight points.
Menga was beaten seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, didn’t look like they were suffering a blow.
At the same time as the Rangers went down to sixth place, the Liverpool took third place, while the Hibernians stayed behind with a difference in the balls.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after forward Column Spence has to deal with a head injury after he's hit an item thrown out of the stands.
Gerard made eight player changes, which is why Ira did not play in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same left under number 11, which allowed him to take the point from the Hearts last week, and was thrilled by how well they did at every step of their opponents.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Libya made more attempts to kill the ball.
They should have been shot two minutes later, when Menghi first pointed the ball through Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor's goals, and then the midfielder took advantage of this opportunity.
The successful penalty kick of Jacob Keegan saved the kidnapping of Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgov was able to carry a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game, they hoped to kill more than they demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Marelas, of course, should have been fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Steven Loveles met on the field, but Judge Steven Tomson did not accept the Colombian complaint.
The Rangers managed to hit the goal only in the first half of the game, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely gave up a goal to Lasana Kulibali and an effective attack on Ovi Echaria.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been against further active play, there is no denying that they have to demonstrate a good game to the player.
Again, the Rangers were unable to break through the gates of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave the pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng for a chance to kill in the gate.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent in the Kulibali break, and this had an effective impact when the attacker broke into Marela, but the impressive Kelly escaped and blocked the blow.
But "Livingstan" continued to please the visitors, playing the game that was exactly what they liked, and Litgov and Chalket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was only able to prevail in the last few minutes, but McGregor played well against Jacobs before the Flyers went on the reserve bench.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton occurred once again after the penalty was imposed when he faced Jacobs, but Tomsana managed to get away with it.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger's calculator.
Page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADIKI... the day of the future physicist Ioann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in the appearance of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Calls of Karanad, in which those who seemed to be little-known scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: Who is he on the earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
"When you put on headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Tell me, is this really urgent right now?”!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd anniversary of his birth.
However, the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to “see” cancerous cells.
A new antigen vaccine can help the immune system "see" bad cells and destroy them. . . .
The vaccine seems to teach the immune system to recognize the bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method provides for obtaining immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
The cells can then “see” the protein, which is distributed in many cancer cells, and then re-introduce the auxiliary cells.
The test vaccine will demonstrate successful outcomes for patients with a variety of types of cancers.
A woman who has been given a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells has found that ovarian cancer has been disappearing for 18 months.
The method involves obtaining immune cells in a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then be re-injected.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzoffsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anticancer cells that fight breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and fat cats,” said Professor Berazoffski.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "learning" them to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West began a discussion in support of Trump, bearing the IAEA title after his appearance in the SNL.
Which didn't turn out well.
In the studio during the evening Saturday evening Kanye West was humiliated after a speech where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said that he would vote for a second term in 2020.
After performing in the evening his third song called "The City of Pride" when he was in the cap "Let's Make America Great Again", he spoke out against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times do I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began a show starring Matt Daeman, where the Hollywood star blushed over Bret Cavano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing on Christine Blaise Ford's sexual assault case.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, West's words fell into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Roc.
I don't know if he was trying to get out of the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They were smiling at me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out there with this hat.
They were smiling at me.
“And then they say I’m in a shady place,” he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West went on: Do you want to see the swinging place? “Speaking that he” will wear my hat to Sperman, which meant that he can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love .
Due to his statements, the hearings were withdrawn at least twice, and representatives of the SNS were confused by a message from Veraiti. "The whole studio was silent."
West was accepted as the replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA's Conservative Party leader Kendes Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most courageous minds Thank you for your support."
But leading the talk show Karen Hunter wrote that the West is just who he is, and that's always wonderful.
“But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying their music or clothing, or by supporting their ‘art’, which I believe covers and disfigures the ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
“Like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "officially named Kane West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Didi.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called the Snoop Lion and, of course, the music legend who changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder in the restaurant "Belfast"
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was attacked on Friday at a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast.
The incident took place in Balochistan, according to police.
The defendants are expected to appear in the courtroom in Belfast on Monday.
The indictments will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of "Games of Thrones" Kit Haringtan has captured the idealized brutality.
Kit Harington is known for his flashing sword and the role of John Snow in the series "Games of Thrones" in the era of medieval HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor has received a stereotype of the hero Macho, which means that young boys often feel tougher to respect.
Speaking in the Sunday Times' Culture section, Kitt said he believed "something happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the <0x23>MeToo era.
A kitten who recently married his "Game of Thrones" neighbor, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, has admitted that he feels the power to solve this problem.
“I feel personally a strong guy – when we were wrong with the courage,” he said.
“Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude we see now?”
The cat believes that television has to be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What lies at the beginning, and why do you teach this?
Why teach on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they need to be so confident in order to be a real person?
I think that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how are we going to change that?
It's obvious what's going on with young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that the series will end next summer, and he will leave the battlefield of the series and will not do sequels or sequels to Game of Thrones.
From November, the Cat will begin to revive the True Western Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave-owner.
The actor recently reported that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best opportunity to complete the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here,” he said.
The rose played the game (Ygritte), a character who is in love with the hero Keith John Snow in this fantasy series, the award-winning "Emi".
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's Headquarters in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported an increase in new cases by 14%.
According to China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%, according to the report.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex as it was in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some parts of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
“However, the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has been reduced to almost zero,” Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is growing by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV infection through sex is an acute problem of the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people continues to exist in the United States.
Due to the conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men, in the end, marrying women, it is estimated.
Many of the diseases are spread from a lack of knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Voters denies the merger of data, uncertainty and conspiracy theory by her parliamentarians.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied charges that her employee had posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that there is a prerogative to the participants of the right wing and their websites.
“Lies, lies, and a lot of abominable lies,” Voters tweeted.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information, posted by an unknown man on the Capital Hill during the hearings of the Senate Commission on Sexual Harassment Indictments against Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh, appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The escape took place some time after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address of the source was linked to the Waters office and distributed information to the Waters team,” Hill said.
“This unfounded assertion is completely false and absolutely untrue,” Voters said in a statement.
“A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded assertion is completely false and absolutely untrue.’”
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
“This denial provokes anger,” Fleecher wrote.
It's a sign that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of not doing what they have done, they shouldn't be caught.
They don't have to behave horribly.
They don't have to question the merits of their accusations.
They need to be calm and cozy.
Fleisher compared Voters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavano when they were accused of having been too diluted during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is voting and participating in the midterm elections, also said on Twitter.
“It’s a resurgence, if it turns out to be true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Voters said that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements.
“We guarantee that the culprits will be found,” she continued, “and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions, which are constructive and dangerous to any of my team’s employees.”
"Johnny English Strikes Again" is the story of Rooney Atkinsan's espionage.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British inclination, and this inclination seems to be in the comedy and action-franchise of Johnny Inglis.The Jonnie Subjet was started in 2011 by Jon Inglis and Jon Inglis.
Will Satyr be able to express well in terms of how obviously foolish we look when we talk about the new possibilities of export?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny Inglesh was given the opportunity to laugh at things – his name was louder than all the comic creations that he made for non-English glances.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, despite his witty pretension to glamour, got a little like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's traits and a little like a guy who brought a single note to the chorus.
Originally his character was based on Atkinsan's journey and international secrets, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There are a few good moments that haven't happened before.
I loved Johnny Inglis, who approaches the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades hit his helmet a little bit.
Atkinsan's gift to the theatrical comedy is brightly demonstrated, but the humor feels weak, and therefore surprisingly, especially when serious films such as "Agent 007: Mission Impossible" certainly offer comedy as a frequency.
Humor feels as if it's not only for adults, but also for children, and even the ridiculously unfortunate incidents of John Inglisher aren't as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in the character of Bin.
The UK's long-term focus is on the UK's long-term problems.
Cyber-hacker hacked into the super-secret community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the spot, to the disappointment of the daily agent – this is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Ellen.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed actor who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything possible with this quasi-Teresai-May, but in the scene.
Her intelligence advisers report that, since every true spy will be discovered, she will have to act on one of those who are already in retirement.
And that means it's all complicated for Johnny English himself: now he's working as a sixth teacher in several high school institutions and gives lessons on how to be an unopened operator: some good examples here, because Inglese is a good example.
Inglesh returned to Whitehall for an extra break and reunited with his longtime friend Bo, who is played by Ben Miller again.
At the moment, Bo has a marriage tied to the commander of a submarine, whose role Vicky Pepperdin played a bit of a waste.
In this way, Batman and Robin get terribly wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting a beautiful woman, Wolga Kurilenka.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire that states that it can solve problems with UK hackers: with the infamous Jason Volt, played by Jake Lay.
Inglish and Bow begin their action with immediate things: disguised as an officer, set fire to the French restaurant; create a pagoda, fight the smuggling of the smugglers on board the smuggling of the smugglers' jets of the luxury yacht of Volts; Inglish performs a cleaning job.
All the moments are drawn for the last event, but also pleasant and noisy, in which there are quite a lot of children in the TV.
It's a pretty good material.
And as with other films about Johnny English, I couldn't have thought: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinsan a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay a British citizen a four-day working week with payment as much as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan if the British work only four days a week, but they are paid for five.
As reported, the party wants the heads of enterprises to communicate to the workers the results of the work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It has been known that employees in the future will enjoy the three-day weekends, but they will still receive the same paychecks.
The source notes that the idea corresponds to the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to the support of workers.
The trade unions' move to a four-day week was adopted as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The planned review of the actions will be announced by the end of the year.
This is not going to happen now, but the four-day working week is an idea that matches the views of the party and the general industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Greens Party promises to hold a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party's intentions are not supported at all.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is the goal of non-party politics, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John MacDonald used a working conference last week to express his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. Macdonald said he had decided to return power from “unmanned directors” and “managers” to communal enterprises.
The shadow chancellor's plans also foresee that the current shareholder of water resources may not get back the entire package of shares, as the Labour government may make a "choice" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it plans to include employees in the company's boards and create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the company's own funds to employees who will hold annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Candace told for "60 Minutes" that the FBI, working with Cavano, will have to change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Bret Kavanaugh has been postponed to a final vote on his removal to the Supreme Court for at least a week. The question arises whether the findings of the Bureau of the Republic will be possible.
In an interview with the show on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pally asked Republicans Johnny Candace and Lindsay Graham about Sense: “Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change?”
Candace was more open-minded than his counterpart from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Candace.
“I said, going to court, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and asked him why the accusation was made, asking, “Did you do this?”
He was a strong man and a strong man.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
“I think Brett Kavanaugh has decided that this will be a scandalous indictment,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“And everyone she calls her couldn’t believe it.
She is only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International People's Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City is the International Festival: an annual music event, which has a very impressive cast of performers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Festival of Citizenship will take place on the large meadow of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to the summit to enjoy the celebrations of the concerts of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Menne.
The International Festival of Citizenship, which appeared in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project against the stigma of an international propaganda group, which hopes to stop poverty as a result of an increase in the number of people.
In order to get a free event ticket (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors have had to perform a number of tasks or "right of action" to be a validator of the event, and to write an e-mail to the leader of the country, Patel.
But how successful was the Civic Festival for the last 12 years and has it been able to achieve its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with an invaluable concert a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of the so-called "clictivism" or the so-called "climbing" - people feel that they are doing it.
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival have stated that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their fans, who strive to achieve different goals.
It says these actions have helped motivate influential leaders to deliver on more than $37 billion in commitments, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, the report said.
At the beginning of 2018, the group brought in 390 comments on commitments and made statements worth at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities of 47 include the provision of food, partnerships with investors and contractors based in the UK, "helping the children to develop more in a way that will not be possible in the future," the promise of Rune 35 provides.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition in history,” Ambassador Tracy Ulman said in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group announced that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK called to improve nutrition for maternity and children, the government announced the funding of the "Food Aid" project, which is being provided by the Ministry of Health.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think that we can end poverty?”
The Global Festival replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will suffer from a collision and a mistake.
But, like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among a number of people performing at this year's event in New York City, which will be led by Debara-Lee Fernance and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy for ‘Blockade’ to Prevent Russian Oil and Gas Exports
“Washington may, if necessary, turn to the navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the EU and Middle East markets,” U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinck said in a statement.
Zink said Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, are the basis for the study of new energy markets, according to Reuters.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to acquire energy in the same way as they do in Eastern Europe and in the south of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to ensure the openness of the naval forces, and, if necessary, to organize a blockade, so that their energy probably does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in essence, the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less equitating and replacing fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “one-sided country” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
"These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its depleted natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers," the statement said.
To this end, Trump administration employees, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “wrong” gas bill “North Stream 2”, which, according to Trump, transformed “Berlin”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline at a cost of 11 billion dollars, which is created to subtract the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's harsh opposition to this project is beginning in the economy and is an example of unwarranted competition.
"I think that we have a single view on the fact that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said the Minister of Energy of Russia Zvety ZvetyAlexandr Novak after a meeting with the Minister of Energy.
The Americans received a blow in response from Germany, which reaffirmed its support for the project.
The German Federation of German Industrialists (BDI), the leading German industry organization, has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industrialists (BDI) Rudolf Udm<0xC3><0xAD>m Mej<0xC3><0xAD>m<0xC3><0xAD>n and Hem<0xC3><0xAD>m<0xC3><0xAD>m.
"Elizabeth Warren is going to seriously discuss her role in the 2020 presidential election," a senator from the state of Massachusetts said in a statement.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterms.
During a speech in the mayor of Halioka, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and organize our inactive government, and I’m also talking about women in the highest positions,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
During a speech at the mayor’s office, Warren addressed President Donald Trump, saying that he “leads the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, before the vote, it is necessary for the FBI to conduct an investigation.”
However, the results of a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe she should vote for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Bostan Glob fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not vote.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed greater support for former governor Daval Patrik, where 38 percent were in favour and 48 percent were against.
Other well-known names among the Democrats that were discussed in connection with the 2020 potential ballot include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont, Barney Sanders, who was elected to the U.S. Senate.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said that he will make the decision by January.
During a trip in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Track Palin.
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after calling for service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and he was charged with felony charges.
"What my son goes through after his return, I can compare with the results of post-traumatic syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers are returning to other families," she said in a statement, which she gathered on the trip in support of Donald.
Palin called the arrest "a ball question" and stated that her son, along with other veterans of the war, "return a little different, hardened, return with the question of whether there is that respect for which the soldiers, other pilots, fought for."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against women, obstructing attempts to report domestic violence, the use of weapons in a drunken state, according to a press release. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new policy on port delivery.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a new U.S. policy that denies victims of gang repression or domestic violence in the dock.
Representatives of 18 states and counties of Colombia filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support a dispute over the port's delivery policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the case in Grace v. Seans, which was opened in August by the U.S. Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his friends with a hard gang" raped her, but the U.S. authorities refused to do so on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which comes the largest number of applications for admission in the United States, such as countries that have serious problems with gangs and homes.
The new U.S. dock policy has changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed immigrants without documents who are victims of domestic violence to apply for docklands.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores a decade of legislative experience of the states, the country and the world."
“Federal legislation requires that the claims at the courthouse be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle,” the analytical note reads.
Lawyers also said in a note that a policy that denies immigrants is deteriorating the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "create the necessary jobs."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges to stop giving shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang-related violence.
"The prison is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
It has never meant a solution to the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day. . . .
Desperate rescue work in Pal. During the attempt to find those who survived, the number of dead doubled
Those who have survived are in a very difficult situation.
“Everything is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother of Rysa Kusuma, calming her little son with the temperature in the evacuation center of the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute the car "should" bring the bodies.
There is very little clean water.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed houses, dismantling wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 points, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who fractured his spine and shoulder, are outside the Palo Army Hospital, where patients are being treated on the street due to recurring strokes.
In his eyes, tears appeared as he recalled the feeling of strong underground beatings in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to escape.
I was stuck under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city to marry.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Threats” Using “Propaganda Advertising”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefits of the U.S.-China trade pledging to the U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has been accused of smuggling.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned a paid add-on to the China Daily in Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to intervene in the U.S. election.
Trump's indictment that China was trying to interfere in the U.S. election indicated that U.S. officials in a conversation with Reuters called a new phase in Washington's campaign for pressure on China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war, resulting in a reciprocal imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, said U.S. and Chinese experts, have been introduced to harm exporters such as businessmen from the state of Ayahuasca, who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, writes Brandt in an authorial article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “is now doubling its efforts by printing propaganda advertisements in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the good American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press by printing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstead.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, then there you will not find so many voices against it and you will not see a real representation of other opinions that may have the Chinese in mind about the issue of a dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account that fact.
He added that “one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has declined the offer” to print his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are deterring women voters on the eve of the midterm elections in Kavanaugh, analysts have warned.
While many well-known Republicans are defending the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavano in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, analysts would have warned the suspects that they would get hit in response, especially in the face of the allegations of sexual violence.
Emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they are ready to vote.
“These things can’t be returned anymore,” said Grant Rhychar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Political Science at Syracuse University’s The Hill for an article that was printed on Saturday.
The resident said he wasn't sure that Senator Jeff Flake's statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, the chief councillor and national press secretary of the Progressive Group, MoveOn from your newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall, when Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to withdraw the candidacy of Flavor from Kavanaugh, despite the statement of Dr. Crty.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be extremely great,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they’re high, and that’s true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women-electors in the suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not like the president, but often do not vote.
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her accusations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believe that if Republicans insist on affirmations, they may have a strong place in the country.
“For the Republican Party, it’s become some sort of mix,” said Michael Stile, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“The talk is not about the committee voting or the final vote, or about whether to put Kavanaugh in office. It’s about how the Republicans handled this and how they got along with it,” the group noted, USAkties news channel, Gay Prisel.
However, it is similar to the fact that the Americans split on the issue of Ford's or Cavano's rights, which is why it is a little more than the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are likely or not very likely to trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent say they are likely or not very likely to trust Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh may or may have lied to in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After a push by Flick, the FBI investigates the charges on the part of Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that when Cavano was drunk, he had made it at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court demonstrated her genitalia in the evening when they were studying at Aile in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global network plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, is launching a startup that will be rivaled by Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows the user to choose the place of storage of the data and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that by creating Inrupt, he meant “ruling over the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "own data storage on the Internet" or PODs.
It can include contact lists, job listings, calendars, fanatics, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this “a personal enhancement of the potential with the help of data.”
In the opinion of John Bruce, the company's CEO, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to put together the resources, process and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM has purchased, several developers working on the contracting project, and co-designers-rollers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized programs, using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brunsley said he and his team had not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a full change if all of their business models were immediately revised.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday publication on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet, creating the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MSI).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in favor of net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new network era,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Honoring a priest awarded with the Victorian Cross in the First World War. . . .
The only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded with the Victoria Cross during World War I as a participant of the battles, was commemorated in his city 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Van was awarded on September 29, 1918 for his involvement in the attack on the Belengles and Leacour.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper bullet and never found out that he had received the highest British military reward.
On Saturday in the town of Rashden, Narthamptanshir County, two of his grandsons at the parade opened a memorial stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through a thick impeller and under the heavy gun and bullet fire of the opponent."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" drove the soldier forward, grasping the gun on his own and firing three units.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never have done and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a windmill after a parade that set up the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said that "for his great honor to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero was demonstrated by the support that many have shown."
Fans of the MMA waited all night to watch the Bellator 206, they instead got Pepa's whistle
Just imagine that you've stayed up all night to watch the packaged transmission from Bellator 206, and then you're denied viewing the main event.
The program with San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they were shown live all night on the British channel Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when Gerard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, watching in the UK just shy away when the program changed to Pep's whim.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, indefinitely waiting for this battle.
One of the ballerinas on Twitter called switching to a children's cartoon a "someone's stupid joke."
In response to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President of Bellator on Marketing and Communications, said: "According to the state decree at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and had to be switched to child care."
"Yes, "Pepa's Swine."
Bellator company president Scott Cocker said that in the future they will be working on the program to count the British viewers.
"I think we're going to discuss the possibility of a repeat, in my opinion, we can resolve this issue," Cocker said.
“But now it’s the sixth morning of Sunday, and we won’t be able to resolve it until Sunday at our own time, and that’s Monday at their own time.
But we're doing everything we can.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the problem, considering that it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state order.
I can assure you that this won't happen next time.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to parade the fans, but we've gone too far.
That’s the most extreme situation.”
"Discs of an Uninhabited Island": Tom Daley felt "insignificant" because of sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley said he grew up feeling insignificant to others because of his sexuality — but that gave him motivation on the way to success.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn’t understand that “not everyone is like me” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Discovery of an Uninhabited Island" show, Lauren Laverne said he supports gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this rather old Kirsty Young program, took a few months' rest due to the disease.
In the role of a man who was on an uninhabited island, on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as a child he felt "lesser" than everyone else, because "the society did not accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said: “I still believe that this feeling that you are not everything and insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he did not disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist of the Olympics became a major activist of the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution, and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American screenwriter, director and producer Dustin Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me.”
Daley married an Oscar holder who was 20 years older than him last year, but, according to him, the age difference doesn't matter.
“If you go through this at such a young age” – at the first Olympics he happened at the age of 14, and even three years later his father died of cancer – he said that it would be difficult to find an equaliser who would experience such a lie.
In June, they became parents, their son's name was Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "perspectives" had changed completely.
“If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my gold medal at the Olympics.”
His son is also called his father Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to sit in the first row, Dad,'" he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized that he wasn’t immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life – jumping in the water in front of my bowlers at the Olympics, it’s the best feeling,” he said.
It also influenced the choice of the song – Proud by Heather Smol – which found a review in preparation for the Olympics and from which ants are still running.
"Discs of the Uninhabited Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Michaelson, who is not in shape, remains on the back seat of Ryder's Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson on Sunday set a record by throwing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to get back in shape so that the event doesn't turn unfortunate.
Michaelsana, who will play in this competition, which is held once every two years, for the 12th time on record, team captain Jim Furrick has placed on a reserve bench for Saturday's forboles.
Instead of being at the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States team, a five-time cup winner divided his days between the scoring and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he wasn't the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer isn't the perfect choice for the tough Le Golf National, where inaccurate strikes are severely punished.
And if the field itself isn't dark enough, Michaelson in the ninth game on Sunday will fight against the exact British Open champion Francis Malinara, who together with Tom Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans who are back on four points in the first 12 singles games start with success, Michaelsson's game could prove to be extremely important.
"Furric expressed confidence in the player, but he couldn't say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, slammed me on my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He’s very confident in himself.
He was accepted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan for two games.
I've been thinking more about it, but that's how it worked.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.”
Michaelson will break Nick Fall's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in the Rider Cup, which has never been the same as the achievements in individual games.
In Michelson's 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyck said that his presence brought the team benefits.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's humorous, he likes to joke about people and he's just a very good person to have on the team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to mess with his jokes, also this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a large gap may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, is aware of the fact that a significant gap ahead of the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup could easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderam, where the European team led by Sev Balesteras had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that at Valderam we had a big lead and won, but with difficulty, we had a big lead in Brooklyn where we lost," Bourne told the club after reviewing the Golf 10 and the team's Class of 2018, won 5-3.
“The story shows me and everyone else on the team that it’s not over yet.
You'll have to play all the games tomorrow.
Go out on the field and do the right thing.
As long as it's not on the table, nothing is done.
We have a goal and that’s an attempt to win this trophy, that’s what we’re going to focus on.
I'm constantly saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the other side there are the best players in the world."
Satisfied with how his players played on a tough golf course, Bourne added: "I will never re-evaluate myself in this.
Tomorrow is going to be a different game.
There will be some games tomorrow, and that's different.
It's just great if you're on the pitch with a partner and everything is going well, but if you play alone, here's where your real talent of a golfer comes in.
Here's what you need to bring to the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave the partner, we have to go and also show the best as an individual player.”
Unlike Bourne, his rival, Jim Furrick, hopes for a better individual game of his athletes than the one they demonstrated in the partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who have taken over.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these matches on the last day, playing in a winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a "Course in the Middle."
“I remember every word of it,” he said, answering a question about how Ben Cransho, the 1999 captain, set his players up for the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start that you’ve seen in Brooklyn and in Medina.
As the speed increases, the greatest pressure is exerted on those who play matches in the middle.
We made the right schedule and put the players in the way we liked them. You know, tomorrow we're going to try to get some magic."
Thomas has been given the task of starting to play and is facing Rory McKilroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rom, Tommy Fleetwood and John Paulter will play against the top golfers.
“I put my players in that order because I think I’m going to close it that way,” Bourne said of his choice for individual matches.
The launch of a new German warship has been postponed.
The new frigate of the German Navy was to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not appear earlier next year due to incorrect systems and constantly increasing costs.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the completely new class of frigates Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The ship was supposed to be put into operation in 2014, but the problems that emerged after the construction are hampering this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class warships, ordered back in 2007, are to be replaced by the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful guns, a variety of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stals technologies, such as reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features – longer periods between maintenance and maintenance – newer frigates may not be able to enter their ports for up to two years.
However, constant deterrence means that modern battleships – which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country – will be outdated until they finally come into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned its Blohm & Voss shipyard to Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the cause of the return, but the German media wrote about the many "defects in the software and equipment" that render the ship useless in the combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships only have 120 sailors – half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, twice the weight of ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to missing equipment, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also becoming a problem.
The price reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion) – although it initially amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems accumulating with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, said the Navy "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions".
He said the problem is increasing over time, as the old ships are being laid down and the ships are not being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Society for the Protection of Monuments has listened to the secret life of the said
A new study, which is being conducted in the Scottish Highlands, is aimed at revealing how the said use the landscape in the hunt for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behaviors of unique flying mammals and to help in future actions to conserve these animals.
The study of Schottland's National Society for the Protection of Monuments is concerned with small, and also large, long-lived, Dubanton's, in the Inver's Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this location, so that during the season they can monitor the actions of the fairies.
Employees of the company and valuators will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings determines the frequency of calls, as well as what are said to do.
The map of the habitat and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dwyer, the National Society for the Conservation of Nature's advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to the species and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows, and how to maintain forests for the habitat of falcons and other related animals.
The number of cases in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and developer works, which affect the place of residence and destroy them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as adhesive tapes for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also endangered by household cats.
They say they're not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal life, the ears say more sensitive than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a complex technique of ejaculation to detect bugs and obstacles in the way of flight.
The national society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the claims.
It employs ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspections of places of residence, and, sometimes, life-saving activities.
The organization has even created the first and only Scottish conservationist of swamps in the Triangle Estate in Dumfries and Maine, where eight of Scotland's ten species of swamps live.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says that this is the perfect territory for the sayings.
“Here, in Triv, we just have a great place to say,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we still don't know much about the sayings, so our work here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
He underlines the importance of checking the availability of the claims before carrying out the repair of the property, since it is possible to accidentally destroy one seat, killing up to 400 males and young claims, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
Detainees are in hiding and are prohibited from killing, intimidating, disturbing or destroying their seats.
Elizabeth Faral, an employee of the Organisation for the Protection of Petitioners in Scotland, is calling on the public to help in this matter.
She says: "We still have a lot to learn about our sayings, and we don't even know how their populations live about many of the species."
Ronaldo has been charged with rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper for rape.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called his accusations of raping him "fake news," saying people want to "reclame themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the accusations.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a studio room in Las Vegas in 2009. . . .
It was as if he paid her $375,000 for the silence, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his subscribers hours after the allegations were posted, calling the message "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said the five-time owner of the Golden Ball in front of the camera.
“They want to make an ad in my name.
It's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but that's part of my work.
I’m a happy and good person,” he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case against Der Spiegel magazine on charges that they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in a private case," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation of the law, and in recent years this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights."
It was as if the incident took place in June 2009 in the suite room of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, California.
Meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorg seemed to be returning to the player's room, where he seemed to have raped her anal, as written in the documents of the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after that Ronaldo got stuck and said that on "99 percent" he is "a good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but with the consent of the parties.
Mayora also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to the out-of-court settlement, because she was “very afraid of revenge” and worried that she would “publicly reduce.”
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to reopen the charge now because she feels a moral trauma for the case.
At the time, as if this case had taken place, Ronaldo was going to move to Madrid's Real Madrid with Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy's Juventus, closing the deal at 100 million euros.
BREXIT: UK will "forever regret" the loss of car builders <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Britain will “always regret” if it loses its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clarke said in a statement on Wednesday.
He added that he was "disturbed" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cut production at a plant in Berne, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of a border delay as a result of Brexit without a deal could lead to job cuts.
The factory in Bournemouth – where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are made – last year released almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
“In my view, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car makers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will be conducted if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is the fact that carmakers are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line operates on a "precisely on-time" basis when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a setback on the border that will lead to a delay and a shortage of parts.
Toyota will not be able to keep more than a day's supply of parts at the plant in Derby, the company said, so the production stops.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s Checkers Plan on future relations with the EU “is designed precisely to avoid these checks at the border.”
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that will not only allow the success of today, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in a program Today on BBC Radio 4.
“The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, suggests that we should be able to continue the work of successful supply chains,” he said.
Toyota has not been able to tell how long the production will not work, but in the future it has warned that the added cost will reduce the plant's competitiveness and will lead to a cut in jobs.
Peter Tsuvaras, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the union's coordinator, said that the union members are very concerned: "It is my opinion that if jobs are shorted, they will not be renewed.
The government’s spokesperson said: “We have proposed an accurate plan of our future relations with the EU, which deserves trust.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week", while the fight around the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, said on Sunday in a statement.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who studies the intervention in the election on the part of Russia, the ties of Trump's aides to Russia and the potential obstruction of justice on the part of the president.
To fire Trump's assistant attorney general or not, and thus endanger Muller's independence, months of oil spills into the fire of Washington's jets.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Trump, and the possibility of the president's resignation with the help of 25 corrections.
Rosemary's going to break it.
But on Monday, he went to the White House amid rumours that he was about to retire.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would take place on Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashes at a hearing in the Senate's legal committee, where Fyodor Doyttian Kavanaugh and one of the women, who accused him, spoke.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further slowed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has appeared on Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date is not yet scheduled, perhaps this week, perhaps the next. I think that, rather, a week later, I'll be taking into account all the other things that are going to happen.
But everything will happen, and I’m always giving the press the latest information.”
Some journalists are ready to challenge her claim: Sanders has not held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
After the show, Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of the brewing is due to the fact that TV reporters are "working in the public", although she added: "I agree with the fact that they work in the public."
She said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
“The president holds more meetings with answers to press questions than any president who has been to him,” she said, adding, without any concrete facts, “We’ve studied these numbers.”
Brewing is taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to immediately ask questions to the president of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We try to do it often, you've seen how we've done it in the last few weeks. Such meetings, where you can ask a question directly to the president, replace the briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions about whether he is leaving the White House or taking part in meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high-ranking foreign guests.
The President's own press conferences are seldom held.
This week in New York City, the president demonstrated why, when freely and sometimes extravagantly appeared in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to employees from EU countries in Scotland's health care system before Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Minister of Health wrote to EU workers working in Scotland's health care system to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and wish them to remain after Brexit, according to the BBC.
Jen Freeman sent a letter less than half a year before Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of residence applications from EU citizens who work in the state services of the country.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations have continued between the UK and the EU on the exit of our country. They are leading to the expected decisions this fall.
But the British government has also hastened preparations for the scenario without a deal.
I know this is a very unfortunate time for all of you.
Therefore, I want to remind you how much I value each employee's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries, and not only, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health care service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay with us.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Chris Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in a Sunday's game that his team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Tengan.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player had received the injury shortly before the break.
“He switched to the sideline and suddenly fell,” Reed said.
Coaches and doctors left Abercombi oxygen still in the field before putting it on the force and transferring it to make a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State spokesperson told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been reopened at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no "details of what the injury was" and Tennessee State was trying to figure out if the player was injured.
Abercombe, a fellow sportsman, will spend the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving just 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of UK real estate will pay a higher tax rate.
According to the new plan of the Conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher fee, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes the success of Corbyn's initiative by attracting young voters.
The increase in the state tax is due to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state tax, and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative by attracting young voters, as well as giving affordable housing. It is aimed at high-income people.
The increase in the state tax is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's homeless housing program.
The increase in the current state tax, including the higher levels adopted two years ago, on the purchase of second homes and housing for rent, can amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
About 13 percent of London's new buildings are bought by non-residents of the UK, which leads to price increases and new buyers find it difficult to buy their first home.
Many of the rich regions of the country – especially the capital – became “private gardens”, because a large number of buyers because of the border most of the time do not live in the UK.
The new policy came out literally a few weeks after Barry Johnson's call to reduce the state tax on young buyers to facilitate the purchase of the first home.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining high prices for real estate by seizing and misusing the land, and called on Ms. May to cancel the quotas for available housing in order to make a "shameful" settlement.
Mr. Corbyn announced a voiced series of housing reforms, including controlling rents and halting the “unreasonable” eviction.
He also wants to give more power to the local councils in the area of housing construction.
May said: “Last year, I declared that I will devote my work as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream – life for every new generation must be made better.
This means that we are improving our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it's unfair that people who don't live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as working residents of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home becomes increasingly inaccessible, and the problem of the homeless remains very real.”
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sanderland coach Jack Ross has said that his main ambition is to one day become a coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old performs the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the First League, three points from the first.
He moved on to this job in the summer, after returning to the Scottish Premier League at St. Mary's last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But we didn’t,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“I grew up with my father and I had a lot of sickness for Scotland at Hampton Stadium, and something always made me come back.
“But that’s a good opportunity if I’m going to be a successful club coach.”
Among the predecessors of Ross in the role of coach of "Senderland" Dick Lawyer, David Moiss, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Poye and Paula d'Canya.
Former Aloe Athletic coach says he was not afraid of such well-known names in such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Now the success for me will be the answer to the question, ‘Will I be able to return this club to the Premier League?’
According to the structure and material base of the club his place is probably in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not just to get him back there, but I will only consider my job a success if I can get the club back there.”
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dambarton and worked for 15 months at the Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloe to return from the third league and turned the Saint-Mir<0xC3><0xA8>ne from the loser, who almost made it to the Champions League in the next season's winner.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his player career at Clyde, Hartlpool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Recalling work at Aloe, he said, “It was a really important choice.”
“I really believed that coaching is what I need, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing because I've worked well, earned well, and reached certain heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I'm still going through this when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what it takes.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, and for me it's the best time of my adult life."

The hot summer has boosted the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but has put pressure on restaurants' networks.
According to the statistics of the group of pubs and bars, sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants the volume of sales decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA's consulting business group, which compiled this statistic, said: "The long sunny weather is longer than expected, and the participation of the English team in the finals of the World Cup is more important than expected.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks until they have shown the best result in contrast to restaurants.
Those who sell more food also sunbathe in the sun, although not as strong as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent, and food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Neumann, RSM's leisure and placement analyst, said: "These results are a trend we've seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to the volume of sales in the public food market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to compete, as sales have fallen by 4.8 per cent per year, and this is very unpleasant when prices are constantly growing.
"The long and hot summer has come at the most difficult time for operators who are focused on food, and the time will show whether the lower temperatures in August will bring such an expected light."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those recently opened, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the brand's deployment.
The sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups, which have a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an important benchmark for this.
One out of every five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children – some of whom were only 11 – has secret accounts on social media that hide it from parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 High School Students Shows Growth of "Facebook Insta" Pages
It's the news that has sparked fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they had “basic” accounts that show their parents that they were not.
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, create accounts on social media that are kept secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in “fake Insta” accounts – which seem to lead to an Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has sparked fears that sexual content will be published there.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they keep “clean” “basic” accounts to show to their parents, and they also keep private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, learned that she had called others to “rape me.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted they had secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the internet where they can’t be found by either parents or teachers.”
Eiled Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Council of Athletics
Eiled Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of Athletics as an observer member of the board at the body's annual general meeting.
Doyle - Scotland's most titled lightweight and chairman Ian Beece described this event as a great opportunity for those who run the sport, to get many benefits from her years of experience at various levels, including mine.
"Elyde enjoys great respect in Scotland, the UK and the global athletic community, and we are confident that lightweight athletes in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the Soviet Union," B said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I will help to manage the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won gold at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two more gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as an expert at the BBC, can't walk after he has undergone a microsult.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if and to what extent I'm going to fix it.
It was a hard job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm practicing agilicity!
Thank you so much for your supportive message!”
The advertising of a milk pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions on the internet.
The dairy pumps company has shared its views, releasing an ad that compares breastfeeding women with cows that are breastfeeding.
To mark the launch of what is called "the world's first infused milk pump," the consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music ad based on a video to show the freedom this device gives to a nursing mother.
Four real mothers dance in a chorus with cowboys under the song, where there are the words: "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have the tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not a leash, it's my breasts."
And he said, “Yes, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am.
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a hot debate on the internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was ambiguous, many said it was the horror of dairy production.
“It’s a very sad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and born to give birth to the baby, only their children pick up in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's Milk Pump Is Incredibly Hiding in a Breastfeeding Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It was traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to advertise a milk pump for a mother who doesn’t have children?”
Someone added: “It’s such an unthinkable advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was “fun.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I had a breast.
The scent of a baby makes me feel like I'm being bullied.
It's a little crazy, but I like it.
“It’s a great product,” she wrote.
Another comment: “A very entertaining advertisement directed at the mother, which absorbs the milk pump (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and hears themselves as ‘cars.’
This is not a bad thing, nor is it a bad thing.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with invisible milk pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel like they're being bullied.
However, the pump Elvie Pump is completely wireless, has no wires, no tubes and is invisiblely hidden in the bras for women who are breastfeeding, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep their children busy and even leave the house.
Ana Balalyr, partner and creative director of the company Mother commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
By justifying the parallel between feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the absorption of milk and its difficulties, while demonstrating in a fun and comfortable way how the new infant pump will take on an extraordinary freedom.
This isn't the first time that Elvis's new album has come to the forefront.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium in a costume from Martha Yakubovsky, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being transported to a tent camp on the Texas border without excessive noise.
While the number of border crossings in a month has barely changed, the number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies carried out by the Trump administration, which have made the situation difficult.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are illegal immigrants, who are threatened to endanger their own residence in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other full-year members of households would need to have fingerprints on them and the data would be passed on to the immigration authority.
Last week, Mattias Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, spoke before Congress with a report on the arrests of dozens of people who had filed a request to sponsor the juveniles.
It was later reported by the agency that 70% of those arrested previously had no convictions.
“About 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we continue to persecute such people,” Mr. Albens said.
For the faster processing of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, due to the fact, according to the staff of the shelter, previously a standard term of 60 days.
A large number of people in order to file an application for their own legal status, the immigration judge will have to use video communication, rather than present in the court in person.
Those who don't have the resources to help, are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and a report from the sources in the system, which have appeared in the last months, the longer the children remain in captivity, the higher the likelihood of the work being caused by depression or an increase in anxiety.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions such as Tarnilla, these problems are much more pronounced, as the signs that the child is in a hot condition are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent town without providing time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many have already faced, and so on.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of the “purchase forces” of the United States, France and Turkey
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the ongoing war in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "will be considered appropriately."
"They have to leave immediately and without any conditions," he said at a meeting of the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and a million people have had to leave their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus intends to “continue this sacred battle until we clear all of Syria’s territory” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
Syria has about 2,000 U.S. troops, mainly serving as instructors and advisers to the forces of the Kurds and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's land contingent in this war-torn country is more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions for the return were favourable and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading of Iranian fears” that contain refugees abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure their return,” he said in a statement.
“They’re politicizing the humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be assisted in the reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition on the end of the war.
The U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major support of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by the Syrian forces, backed by Russia, into the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the militants from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "will be
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, to develop a successive constitution for Syria and pave the way for Syria.
Mualem expressed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be restricted "by reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump is going on the second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many liberal viewers hope, the impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency on time.
And this, without a doubt, will be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in all history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the viewers.
Since 2014, the rankings in prime time have grown more than twice – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the broadcast of the "Rachel Maddow Show" channel MSNBC's broadcasts gathered on the screen of the channel's streams, which has attracted 3.5 million viewers and exceeded the audience.
“It’s a fire that people are reaching out to because we don’t understand it,” said Neil Burr, director of ABC’s drama The Successor, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nelly Scowell, a handsome comedy writer and author of the book “A couple of funny details and some tough truths about penetrating the Galician boys’ club,” there is another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The president told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
- Why? - She asked.
He replied, “Because he’s weighing me,” Miss Scowell told me.
Chaos is worth it, even if it can calm down.
Of course, unlike the rest of the television, the storylines that come out of Washington can become as decisive for the future as the case of "The Dream vs. Wade," it will depend on whether it will be possible for the immigrants' families.
Ignorance is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
And yet, if you're looking at the sixth hour of the week in the Washington Post, how a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "information is not for printing" in the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket is like a $15,000 coat of leather (suit, underwear)

When I spoke to Mr. Flays this week, outside the windows of his house on the north shore of Kauai was a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while it was recorded on CNN.
He couldn't stand it, not even when Brett Kavanaugh stood up before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which hung on his head.
“I remember the guys when we released these crazy shows, and people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flies told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

External cash flows are inundated in a tough pre-election race of interim elections in the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th constituency has been covered by a silver lining thanks to a change in the boundaries of the congressional districts, which is why two candidates take part in the election for one seat.
The newly redesignated suburban area of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Connor Lamb, who won his place in another district in the elections last spring.
Lambo is opposed by another acting MP, Republican Cat Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th District.
The maps were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th arrondissement caused a decline in the financing of the company by the financial groups of the main parties, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Company (CCDC) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (RC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in a wide-spread election in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won in the district with an opening of 20 points.
Politicians have found a small advantage for the Democrats.
The U.S. is considering the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then resigning
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already backed Beijing's position, despite Washington's insignificant opposition, according to the report.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners elected Trump's team-leading team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "recent resolutions of the United States on the non-recognition of Taiwan," the statement said.
However, the sanctions were only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including control of drug trafficking, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include the reduction of financial aid and deliberate restrictions on the issuance of visas, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
At the end of the internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, as well as the prospects for the future, which would be the continuation of a similar meeting at the summit.
But by mid-September, the administration's high-ranking representatives will continue to understand that they want the conference to take place and actually stop considering the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favour of holding the event.
The three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further stringent messages or punishments from Washington, D.C.
The White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debates, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on the condition of detention.
Their messages are confirmed by another, close to the administration's analysts, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Let's learn the history
The next step may be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice, on the examples of which at present there is very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr Mueller drew attention in the investigation of the possibility of a conspiracy between the Trump and Russia company in the attack on the election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in front of this body, just as he is preparing to speak again before the electorate, and, possibly, in the end, before the jury in front of his colleagues.
There are a lot of “ifs” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like he is in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that determines how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
"We have failed and have given up the opportunity to avoid blood transfusions in the coming years.
The story revolves around such moments of change, and the unrelenting march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
The U.S. has faced a number of these moments of change.
What will happen if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the newspaper wrote about the fact that last year he had secretly proposed to write down the words of the president and considered his profligacy.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times’ account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the FBI's recent investigation into Brett Kawan's case is not omnipresent or fair, or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite the trustworthiness of the indictment?" he said.
And first of all, are we going to vote in an election for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America and after 60 years sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this table with a swastika.

Graham Dorans of the Rangers is optimistic the day before the match with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers are taking the "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain over the "Williams" earlier this month will certainly allow them to leave the Group G League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from making a 2-2 appearance with William for the first time in the season, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a trap.
“This was an important match for us, because Villareal is a strong opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we could get something, and we earned a point.
In the end, we could have hit the ball, but at the end of the day, it was also a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we took our hands and we had the better half of the field.
On Thursday, there will be another significant night for the European Football League.
I hope we can earn three points, but it's going to be a tough game as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of winners on the stands, I'm sure we'll be able to beat them both.
"Last year was determined to be difficult, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the workouts are productive.
I hope that we will be able to move forward, overcome the result of last season and achieve success.”
Women Lose Their Sleep Due to Fear of Retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had an accurate idea of what they wanted to take care of themselves, few of them spoke about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who took part in the international study reported that they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care, according to the study.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to discuss it,” said Holly Snyder, the nationwide vice president of life insurance.
Here's what to start with.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not meet your wishes in advance.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in India
According to officials, at least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to grow.
Due to the disconnection, humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the regency of Dongala, a region north of Pal, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-bay earthquake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a catastrophic disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people for 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 180 miles (300 km) along the coastline on the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency is an administrative unit with a status lower than the province, in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moraval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Mitigation of Natural Disasters, Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed in a tsunami in Dongala and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Dongala in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic-active pacific fire ring and it is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indian province of Acheh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in a total of 226,000 casualties along the coast of the Indian Ocean.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred south of Java, the most densely populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: In the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake with a power of 7.6 points took place.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred on one of the Mentava islands outside Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Podzi Jaya regency in Achech Province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation as a result of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of the buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lambock, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings and has left thousands of tourists without the possibility of leaving.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence in her family.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of the attack.

The federal prosecutor's office has called for a rare death sentence for a suspect in a New York terror attack.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking a death sentence for Syphilis Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack, which killed eight people - a rare punishment that was not used in the state for 19 federal crimes.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used the stolen truck of the company "Home Depot" in October to ride a bicycle path along the chassis of the West Side in Lower Manhattan, beating his foot and a windmill.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to the announcement of the intention to achieve the death penalty, handed down to the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove to the court that Saipov "intentionally" shot eight people and "intentionally".
According to the documents of the court, for both violations, a possible measure of punishment in the form of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigative jury ahalamila saipova by filing a charge with 22 points, which included eight counts of indictment and a count of indictment in the case of murder in support of the report; this is usually the case.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "ancient and deliberate planning" and, describing the crimes committed by Saipa, used such phrases as "decent, harsh and degraded."
"Syfula Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damaged and lost to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelina, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lora Mandeka, Ana Mandeka, Darena Drake, Ariel Erleia.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina, according to the report.
It's been ten years since the last criminal case started with the death penalty in the form of the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murders of two drug suppliers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York for the federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted after they were convicted of a conspiracy to spy on Sasquatch two years earlier.
A couple of Rosenbergs were sentenced to an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an expatriate from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated the lack of conscientious objections in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov informed the authorities that the attack was inspired by the viewing of the video footage of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked for permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital, police said.
He did not find himself guilty in the indictment, which consists of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "unconditionally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of liberation, only to prolong the pain of these events for all participants," Patan said.
Saipawa's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to face the death penalty.
A member of parliament from Thora says Nigel Farage should set up negotiations on Brexit.
Today, during a protest at the Tora party conference, Nigel Faraj vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
Former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel discomfort” from Eurosceptics – as one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bowen, a member of parliament from the Conservative Party, said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would have already "come out" if Mr Farage took the post of secretary of state for Brexit.
But the problem Ms. May faced in an attempt to restrain her dissenting supporters has worsened when the Tories, who are in favour of preserving EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister, with all his might, is trying to keep the compromised Checker Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and supporters of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and its “ownlessness.”
Mr. Bowen said at a rally in Salihal “Leave Means Leave” that he wants to “take the Checker off the board.”
He suggested that Mr Faraj be made equal and that the obligations for negotiations with Brussels be enshrined.
“If he had been responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingboro added: “I’m in favour of Brexit, but we need to move away from the Checker plan.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to follow our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bowen rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely inconsistent with the reality."
A supporter of Brexit and a member of the Tory, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in an interview with reporters said: "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Cheker plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and activists who actually go out on the street and choose us.
Please, give up the plan and start listening to it.”
In a brief remark to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain in office when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians should be forced to "feel uncomfortable" if they are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum, which he said would be a good choice.
“This is a question of trust between us – the people and the politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them, ‘It’s not going to go out of your hands.’”
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make those of our politicians who are ready to betray Brexit feel uneasy.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-serving, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city's center.
Several activists waved the banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
The Labour leader, Lord Adanis, has resented the Conservatives on the occasion of the security problems they encountered due to the program for the party at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for the border without friction, for the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
Such a thing as a good Brexit. does not exist," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of voting for the post of president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she "will pay close attention to the process of voting for the post of president."
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from the state of Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about his future during a general eastward drive in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to go to re-election, she is opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Dil, who was a co-founder of Trump's Massachusetts company in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, it has been the 36th meeting with voters in a common-easterly format, which took place on Saturday in Halioka.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for the position of president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for that, a woman must be at the head.”
The arrest took place after the death of basketball player Sims from the Louisiana State University team.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that the suspects in the murder of basketball player ISL Wade Sims were arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dean Simpson during a press conference that took place at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was depicted on it.
The 20-year-old was shot on Friday morning near the campus of the University of the South.
"Wayd Sims received a gunshot wound to the head as a result of which he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of the investigation, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist the arrest and was taken into custody in the police station of the East-Baton-Rug district.
The 6-foot, 6-inch (201 cm) junior sportsman grew in Baton Rouge, the Sims last season played in 32 games, 10 of which were on the pitch from the start of the season, a 2,9 innings, and averaged on the pitch in 17.4 minutes.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of World Champion after a team-wide win over Selfie Fettle. . . .
From the moment Valtery Botas warned on Saturday about Lewis Hamilton's qualifying race, it became clear that the orders within the Mercedes team played a significant role in the race.
Botos pulled out a good seat on the razor and almost left Hamilton at the mercy of fate until he defended his place on the first two lashes and invited Fetell to attack his friend on the team.
Fetel was the first to go on a pit stop and let Hamilton fight at the end of the overall mass of the riders, it was this maneuver that had to be decisive.
The pilot of the Mercedes went on a pit stop for the round later and came out from behind the Fetel, but Hamilton came out forward after several round-to-round maneuvers, which forced the driver of the Ferrari's cab to be forced to leave the internal space.
Max Ferstapen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the net and was in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race while holding the tyres, because he wanted to finish quickly, beat Kimi Rykanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on the 44th cross, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikanen took fourth place.
"It's been a tough day because Walter performed fantastically all weekend and expressed himself as a real gentleman if I'm allowed to speak like that.
“The team did a great job to take first and second place,” Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump sneered Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she was not a source of leakage of Christine Blaise Ford's letter to the Supreme Court in which she accused the candidate.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly to Ford's statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate was "demonstrating how people can and can not be "deceptive"
“The only thing that can happen, and the most beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly, and lying people,” he said.
“When you read about press releases and escapes, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document – “Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no.
There was nothing from me.”
Hold on a minute.
We let the escape... No, we didn’t,” he added, advising the senator.
Finnstein sent a letter in July detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kawan, and he fled in early September — but Finnstein denied the escape had taken place from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t let her history escape,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked for the story to remain confidential, and I accepted her request,” she said.
But her rejection probably didn't like the president, who commented so during Saturday's rally: "Here's what I'm telling you, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president has made the assumption that Democrats are using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power by any means possible.
You see the arrogance, the morass, and they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.

Air traffic controller dies, rescuing hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia has been heroically killed, ensuring a successful take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared without warning after a massive earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused a tsunami.
Strong underground raids are still going on, and many people are buried under rubble in the city of Palo.
Although his colleagues escaped, 21-year-old Antonios Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the managerial high-rise that was rolling wild at the airport of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
It remained in place until the 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, broke off from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided that it was going to be destroyed.
Later, he died in the hospital.
According to the Australian program ABC News, according to the representative of “Air Navigation Indonesia” Johannes Siriit, the manager’s decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We were preparing a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was supposed to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning, before the helicopter reached Paul's home.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities are concerned that the number of victims could reach several thousand, and the agency for the reduction of the risk of catastrophic disasters claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Buton is limited.
The representative of the agency Sutopa Purva Nugroh reported: “It is possible that the number of victims will still increase, since many bodies have still not been able to recover from the fall of the fractures.”
The waves, which reached up to six meters, devastated Paula, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes will be provided with humanitarian aid.
Rita Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the car “shut” brings the bodies.
There is no clean water.
“There are shops all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a rush to help those who have survived, but we don’t know what awaits them here.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President of Indonesia Jok Vidoda arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered from earthquakes in Lamboke, in which more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, one man escaped without notice after crash of plane in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight, which carried out an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, previously stated that all 47 passengers and the team happily evacuated safely from the plane, which was hidden, and now has been booked.
The company Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday, it can not give a report on the location of one passenger-man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately disclose the details of the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after landing the plane on the water while attempting to land at the island's Chuuk airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday; all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unexplained.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon, not reaching the landing strip.
According to some of the witnesses, the plane crashed into the landing strip.
According to U.S. passenger White Janes, the plane was flying very low.
“It’s been very successful,” Janet said.
According to him, he and others were able to get through the belt in the water before the emergency exits of the plane that had already sunk.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, as well as that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that the maroons that ran off near the dock also helped to rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst restores the course of events in the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment completed the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulet over the course of several hours gave evidence as a drawn expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to find out the location of 29-year-old quinton telis and 19-year-old jessica chambers victim on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Roulet, he received information about the location from several mobile phones that showed that Teles was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts his previous statement.
When the data that his cell phone was near Chambers's phone at the time when, according to him, he was together with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were directed to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford gave testimony on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the indictment asked if Telis was telling the truth about Senfard being in the van that night, he said he was “lying as my van was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was the assertion of Telis that he was acquainted with Chambers about two weeks ago when she was killed.
The cell phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
According to Roulet, shortly after her death, Chambers Teles removed her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Haley said.
The defense side is due to start the sides' dispute on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later on the same day.

Nanya from New York is sued by a married couple for a "racial" message after her release
Nanny from New York is suing a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a randomly sent message from her mother with a complaint that she is “another blackhead.”
The couple denies that they are racists, leveling the gaps to the "competition".
In 2016, Linsy Plasca-Flaksman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black-skinned when she arrived on her first working day.
“NEEEEEEE, YASHCHE ONE CHRONASKURA,” Ms. Plaska-Flaksman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent a message to Ms. Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, understanding the mistake, Plasca-Flaksman "heard the inability" to fire Ms. Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African-American, was poorly at work.
Mrs. Morris paid for the day's work and was sent home on Uber.
Morris is now in court and wants to get compensation for his dismissal in accordance with the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months of living.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” she told Post on Friday. “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denied accusations of racism, claiming that the release of Morris was a reasonable decision, given that they couldn't trust her after she was ousted.
“My wife sent her something she shouldn’t have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plaska, told Post.
“And would you trust your children to be the one you’ve been rude to, even by chance?
"Your mother-in-law?
Is that right?”
The applause equates the nodes to the “competition” and reports that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
"And you're going to chase a man in that situation?
It’s pretty hard,” – added an expert on investment-banking activities.
While court scrutiny is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the married couple on social media, subjecting them to sharp criticism of their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were worried that readers would not be superseded by the bear who speaks, said in a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s so exciting to read this, already knowing about Paddington’s great success.”
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC actor until he dared to write a children's book about a little toy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work had not been accepted, and added that by the age of 60, he had been an optimist.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success, referring to Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family."
“He was quite a quiet man, and not at all exasperated,” she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a parent's honor for the child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your merit.
I think he's been looking at Paddington's success in such a key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave what was proper to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to talk to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was delivered to the hospital of Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors fought for her life in vain.
“I phoned on a regular basis to tell her that everything was really bad, that she couldn’t stand it,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa said.
“Then I called Nad to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Daddy, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave to her to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the end.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was going on there.
I couldn't stand, I couldn't stand, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, because there were families and people around me.
I had to keep it.”
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperuse, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers – and they didn’t know what she had to go through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and tears were on my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but that's when I was in the middle of a fight.
He was in need of my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who are saddened to take out their cards in order to prevent suicides on the bridge
"Two women who have lost their loved ones, who have committed suicide, do everything in their power to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put out cards with warm words and phone numbers on which people can get help, on the bridge in Wales.
Ms. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began his depression, and at the age of 18 he died of suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I feel,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
“Everybody knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room.”
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother's body after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says: “I am constantly concerned that this may have unpleasant consequences.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards, "so that people know that there are people in the world that you can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t worry, you need to talk.”
Ms. Hasfrys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad, or that he was depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holy day he was very upset: when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
She said that his death was a big injury for them, but had to live with it: "There was a big hole in the family.
It just kills us.
But we have to continue to live and fight.”

The future of Bret Kavanaugh is uncertain because the FBI is starting an investigation.
“I thought we could have what he wants — limited in time and in a hospice investigation — we could get a bit of a snack,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was “disrupting” with the matter.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their dislikes are sometimes explained.
The midterm elections in just five weeks, on November 6 – if Republicans are expected to suffer a blow, then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect the candidate they need to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called on the senator to overhaul the support of Mr. Cavano, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife, Ashley, who then worked as Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the Fed's report is published?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during a vote in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea has been declining under Kim's leadership.
The number of refugees from North Korea to the South has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said on Thursday (Reuters).
Puk Bo-sung, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that last year there were 1,127 overrunners, and in 2011 there were 2,706.
Mr. Puck said the main reasons are the increased border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs imposed by the smugglers for the relocation.
Pyongyang didn't comment on this.
The majority of the refugees from the North are currently gaining the citizenship of the Republic of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, with which North Korea has the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily protected.
China treats migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed on common terms to work with the aim of fully liberating Korea from nuclear weapons, the statement said.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Yang Ho, accused U.S. sanctions in the absence of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we are not going to be the first to disarm,” Rye said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh a “hysterical,” she says he shouldn’t work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano "the hysteric" and stated that at his own pace he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t get rid of the idea that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her a ‘hysterical woman,’” Pelosi said of his reaction to the speech in front of the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denounced the accusations of sexual harassment to Dr. Christina Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even yelling and couldn't speak when his family and senior school classes were being discussed.
He also explicitly blamed the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "a gratuitous and organized murder of a person," organized by the Liberals, who were outraged by Hillary Clinton's 2016 defeat.
Pelosi said he believed that Cavano's speech showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he clearly showed that he had a feat against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Cavano, if he was elected and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he doesn’t just have to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
At the moment, Cavano is a judge of the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she is concerned about Cavanaugh's potential decisions against the Accessible Medicine Act or in the Rowe v. Wade case because Cavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings on the confirmation of the post, Kavano did not answer the question whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and expect the words ‘how wonderful this is,’” Pelosi said.
A woman should be able to do that.
It's a legitimate indictment, months and years of anger just pours over, and she can't remember it without tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Stone told me 45 years ago.
“I don’t think it’s that rare.”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who worked as a director somewhere, and who said that when she got caught, she was crying, but she was working on behavioral techniques. When she got caught and I was crying, I was crying.
But I'm angry."
I just continued the conversation.
I think it was great.”
Tears are allowed in part as an exit of the sum, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of the first job, which I once cried out in anger, then I was grabbed by an elderly woman for the hood – a restrained head who always scared me a little bit – and held me back.
“Never let them see you in the tears,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they brought you.”
Patrick Schrodar, at the time a Democratic congressman from the state of California, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was caught up in a marital betrayal on a yacht called Monkey Business and left the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroder thought that she herself could take part in the presidential campaign.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates already, and I didn’t need them at all.
Someone called this situation "White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the company has gone for quite a long time, it lacked the funds, so she said she would not take part in the election if it does not take $2 million.
It was a loser's situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m going with a discount?” she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so deeply overwhelmed by emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system, which has made it so difficult for her to get money, and is not directed at you.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroder recalled a press reaction to her condition.
“You could have thought that my corporate sponsor is the manufacturer of paper surveillance Kleenex.
Have I ever thought about what they're going to write on my rock?
“She was crying?”
Why the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The first wave of the trade war between China and the United States has been staggering, and as the war is far from over, in the longer term misunderstandings between the countries could be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing China's major export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs hit goods totaling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods that arrive in the U.S. from China.
Each time Beijing responded in this way, it recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent on U.S. goods at a cost of $60 billion.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and the second-largest economy is unlikely to lead the eye.
To force Washington to step down, we need to deepen the demand, but a public inclination to the United States is virtually unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in the long run could support China, reducing the mutual dependence of the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would start the process of a sharp economic downturn is far more dangerous than the U.S. is likely to be a threat," said Abigail Grace, a U.S. aid officer.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the country, destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"To date, the situation in the country is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to return to normal life.
"We now have all the conditions for the return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods," he said.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people who live in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that have sponsored the militants.
Europe wins the Rider's Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States has lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Björn scored 14.5 points to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelsson, who fought the most in the tournament, pushed his ball into the water on 3 pairs of the 16th hole, scoring this match by Francesco Malinara.
The Italian golfer Malinara played excellently in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who passed this field with a 5-0-0 number since the start of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spice was knocked out with the number 5 and 4 player with the lowest ranking in the European team, Thornbörn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, has lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter from England, who may have played in his last Ridder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of the Rieder eight cups, has become the player with the most wins in the tournament with a career score of 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to bring the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after winning the European team.
He handed over the relay to his landlord John Rama, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles game.
“I’m very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man I’ve been watching since I was a kid,” said 23-year-old Rom.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic of one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 major titles and is behind only Jack Niklaus on this score.
The American team competed with each other except for Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and the Dark Finns, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game to defend his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're bikers.
This morning, we often showed Europe what we were capable of.
We were fighting.
Let's take off the hat in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
"I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off the hat in front of them.
We've been moved."
