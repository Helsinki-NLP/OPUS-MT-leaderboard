Last Minute: Our Cosmic Visitor Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, perhaps, more giant galaxies in the Solar System that can cause serious consequences when they are orbiting and colliding.
The path of these bodies, which may have closed or open orbits remaining from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass through Earth.
The 650-metre-diameter asteroid 2014 JO25 will also be such a visitor and will pass 1.75 million km from Earth’s nearest location at 14:24 today.
Over the course of the day, we hear this kind of news more often.
The main reason for this is the advancements in observation techniques and observation tools.
This allows us to identify smaller asteroids that have never been identified before.
Last January, for example, an asteroid about the size of a bus traveled only half the distance between the Earth and the Moon (<0x7E>250,000 km).
And it was only a few days before the even more interesting asteroid pass.
So there might be other cosmic buses coming over us right now.
What would you do if you learned that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter would fall right in the middle of the neighborhood where you were located?
In fact, asteroids of this size won't destroy your neighborhood, but they'll probably blow up the windows of all the buildings.
This will be due to shock waves from the asteroid that will burst into the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that fell to Russia in 2013 was of this size and was enough to break the windows of buildings in several cities.
However, if you have a neighborhood at the target of an asteroid 100 meters in diameter, it is recommended that you go at least 50 km away from your neighborhood that advises you.
Criteria such as the size and impact angle of an asteroid are the factors that determine the depth of the crater and the damage the impact will cause.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If an asteroid hits the Earth at an angle of 45 degrees per second at a speed of 60 km per second, it is about 250 meters deep and 1,200 meters in diameter.
According to the Richter scale, the impact is equivalent to an earthquake at 6 magnitudes, and even if you are 10 km away from the impact point, a third degree burn occurs in your body.
The remaining 50 km will be waiting for the broken windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile in diameter, it gets even darker.
If such an asteroid strikes the Earth at the same angle and velocity, it will form a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 kilometers in diameter.
So a large cluster of craters turns into craters and disappears instantly.
Even if you are 100 km away from the impact point due to the heat resulting from the impact, a 3rd degree burn occurs in your body.
According to the Richter scale, the impact is equal to the earthquake at 8 magnitude.
The damage the asteroid will do depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rock structure of the region where it hits.
The above values are given by reference to the scenario that arises when an asteroid like a hard rock falls into an area consisting of tortoise rocks.
If the asteroid mostly consists of iron, and falls on a surface formed by the cooling of the lava, the size of the crater will increase threefold, and the resulting disaster will be sustained.
66 million years ago, something worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were exposed to disaster as a result of the impact of an asteroid about 10 km in diameter.
As a result of the impact of the asteroid, 75 percent of the marine and terrestrial life disappeared instantly.
If a massive asteroid that destroyed dinosaurs targeted Earth, be sure the most robust option would be to leave the planet.
Tons of matter fall out of space every day.
Most of them burn in the atmosphere and become ash.
Some large enough stars burn in the atmosphere causing glares known as star sliding between people.
Let's end with another piece of news that will comfort our writing.
Studies show that a massive asteroid is not expected to hit Earth over the next 300-400 years, which will cause very serious destruction.
As an average of 70 years of living creatures, I'm sure you've been relieved to have a nap.
Flash claim for Medal: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who wants to supplement the Stoper area, is keen to see the Black-Whites leave Inter's name on the agenda...
A 30-year-old footballer, who has taken a vacation in the Chilean Confederation Cup and recently started working with Inter again, is awaiting offers.
According to the prestigious Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> made a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million offer to Inter for Medel, which can take over both the stops and the front libero.
While the Black-Whites, who offered the offer to Medel, were said to be waiting for an answer from both sides, the Chilean footballer was said to be keen to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta’s claim that the FFP limit is quite difficult for the Black Cartel to pay a fee of about 10 million euros for Medel.
There is a possibility that black and whites will be able to add the star player to the cast in the event of a serious discount to Medel by way of rental, as is the case with the Caner Free transfer.
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> reported Negredo's transfer to the stock exchange
Human rights group has issued a travel warning for Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning for people of color to travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads as follows: "The state of Missouri NAACP Travel Advice Notice is valid as of August 28, 2017, when African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourins end up in a state-wide context, including the fact that in recent years, there has been a lot of questionable, racially-based incidents that have been taking place in the country."
The NAACP said a new Missouri law made it difficult for people to win cases of discrimination, while at the same time targeting minorities disproportionately in the state’s legal practices, the group is effective in publishing this travel warning.
“There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin,” Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, told Kansan City Star.
"We hear complaints when we've never heard them before."
For the first time, the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group exemplified racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders was arrested and charged with a crime by the Missouri police after fueling his way through the state and died under suspicious conditions.
The recommendation also draws attention to a new report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
“The advice is for people to be awake and to warn their families, friends, and co-workers about what might be in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People must be ready to bring welfare money with them, to inform their relatives of the matter they are going to pass through this state."
In Missouri, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, according to the latest figures in the FBI’s hate crimes reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar offenses.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a workplace to sue for discrimination while renting a home or doing work.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after these states' local executives ordered the arrest of people for migrant violations; the ACLU had issued a travel recommendation that would increase the number of migrants by race.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently defense groups have resorted to this practice in response to a set of laws and tendencies within the U.S.
Demba Ba in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two years ago and hired by the Black-Whites last season, returns to Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> for free.
The Black Eagle, who asked for a detailed health report last week from the Senegalese player, took action following the report from the star footballer.
Starting working for a 32-year-old player whom the Chinese representative did not think of in the upcoming season, the Black and White administration knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not included in the list
Unlisted in China because of its foreign status, Demba Ba told the administration that he wanted to return to the Black-Whites.
The Chinese team has confirmed the departure of the 32-year-old player.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days to sign the official contract.
Castillo was operated on in Trabzonspor
In a statement posted on the club’s website, Castillo underwent left knee arthroscopic meniscus surgery at Istanbul Liv Hospital, stating, “Our player will start training with the team in 4 weeks after the operation carried out by Prof. Dr. U<0xC4><0x9F>ur Haklar”.
Castillo was injured by a right-back in his training match with Dutch team Heerenveen at the Slovakia camp.
The Colombian player, who was reported to be away from the field for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was also scheduled to have surgery due to his previous meniscus problem.
Referendum from Barz<0xC3><0xA1>n!
Barzani gave a speech at a commemorative ceremony in Duhok city on the 3rd anniversary of the attack by the terrorist organization DEASH on the Ezids in the Sincar district of Mosul.
In his speech, Barzani, referring to the independence referendum that the ICTY wanted to hold on September 25, said: "I have to say with regret, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country."
We tried all the ways with Iraq, but we were completely hopeless and hopeless.
The past experiences we have had with Iraq have brought us to this situation and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
Therefore, in order to ensure life and security together, we must show that we can all determine our destiny to the whole world through a referendum.
I also need to draw the gold; the referendum is not a goal for us, but a tool for us to achieve a larger goal.
Recalling that the Iraqi central government had made many promises to the Kurds after the collapse of the Baath regime in 2003, Barzani said a direct referendum was taken after the struggle with the DEAS.
Barzani, who wants to define his destiny peacefully and democratically for the self-defense and development of the IKBY people, said: “It has emerged with the Belgians that Iraq does not protect us as a state or does not want to protect us.”
"He doesn't want us to move forward," he said.
Barzani, responding to the fact that the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the fight against the DEAS, noted that Hashdi Shabi, who was founded with a feud within a short period of time, was immediately legalized and provided all weapons:
Peshmerga has not been reported within Iraq's defense system.
The central government did not do to Peshmerge what had been offered to Hashdi Shabi.
According to the constitution, Peshmerga is considered part of Iraq’s defense system.
But when Hashdi Shabi did not exist in the constitution, the laws were violated and all possibilities were transferred.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerga and Hashdi Shabi fought on the same front, and why, on the one hand, Hashdi Shabi was legalized, while the presence of Peshmerga and the fight against terror were covered up.
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist organization DEA<0xC5><0x9E> launched an attack on the Ezids living in the Sincar district of Mosul, killing many people, including women and children.
He came back from the front in 10 minutes.
According to the BBC, the Boeing 777 passenger aircraft belonging to the Air France airlines was in the air while a North Korean missile was in the west of Hokkaido in northern Japan.
Officials who recorded the missile crashing into the area where the plane was located 10 minutes ago, recorded that the missile was estimated to be approaching the plane for 100-150 kilometers.
A statement from Air France said the missile did not cross the route of the aircraft and there was no problem with the flight in question.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the rocket's route has fallen to the sea more than 100 kilometers away," the statement said.
Nothing is sacred, isn't it?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The clearest sign of regime change is that they start attacking statues.
Americans know the picture of it as much as anyone; after all, the carefully-drawn overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 in the Firdos Square in Baghdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key theorists, and CNN’s Jim Acosta, knew exactly what the president was doing in a heated debate about legal immigration restrictions in a harsh way, while destroying the Statue of Liberty in a symbolic way.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack him.
If he did, the owner of a full boat tour and the imitator of Freedom would lynch him.
But he attacked his monastery, and especially the monastery that was dedicated to him after 17 years after the completion of the monument itself, after Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to the monument base.
Miller told Acosta: “I don’t want to talk about history from beginning to end here, but the Statue of Liberty... is a ridiculous symbol of light to the world of American freedom.
The poem you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller's right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This is about the contemporary reflection of Lazarus’ frightening words, it seems that not only in these a state invites not only some elderly immigrants but also the poor one: “The tired, the poor one, the periphery of the press, the masses of the press, the masses of the press, the masses of the press, the masses of the press, the breath of the freedom, the press.
There's never been a time when the "fearful undesirable" on our screens was so visible.
Miller did not bring a literary criticism; he explained that these people were not welcomed by Trump in the United States.
The conflict over the mana of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it’s actually a conflict about the mana of America.
Lazarus and his friends who campaigned to put his words on the base of the statue after his death knew very well that they had entered into a rather political action.
The statue intended to celebrate the connections between French and American republicanism and to represent the feminine development of freedom in the form of a feminine figure.
Lazarus changed his mind: in his poem the figure of the woman was no longer abstract, there was a voice.
And he gives her a very different name: The Mother of the Exiles.
The image of the poem is a brilliant feminist coup d’état and a devastating attack on American immigrants.
And just as the same Lazarus changed the shape of the statue, the right-wingers had long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, one of the great Baptist John-style speakers for Trump’s arrival, argued that in 2010 Freedom did not invite anyone inside but rather held American fire into the dark world as an early-round neocon: “Miss Liberty stands out.
He has to move the forest of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to illuminate the path to the United States of America."
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The mana of the statue was entirely concerned with the perceptual angle.
Lazarus’s magnificent creative act was to see it as being seen by people on deck who were depleted, depleted but hopeful, after long and mostly terrible journeys.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who were looking for a place to shelter and who wanted to improve their lives.
His statue was responding to them with words of hope and a warm welcome that they needed to hear.
Of course, that’s not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find right in any way.
It is not to guide them, but to arouse their hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scots could join the UK team
Neil Black, the UK’s athletic performance director, says the 16-man Scottish group in the World Championship squad will make a “huge contribution to the team.”
The record-breaking Scottish athlete was selected for London 2017 starting Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK athleticism should learn from it.
Black said, “We’re adopting it and we’re trying to understand it and we’re going to try until we get out of the business.”
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s about what they’re doing.
Scottish athleticism thinks it has to do with what they do.
British athleticism: He thinks it’s about what they do.
The guy on the corner, too.
Whatever the combination of conditions, it’s definitely great.”
Many Scottish athletes, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m, compete for medals, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain by the squad.
"We'll need a little bit of volunteering.
The captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
“Whether they’re Scottish or wherever they live or practice, a few athletes have been very proud and really motivated from that room.
The passion and true feeling that Eiledh naturally combined was wonderful."
The silver medalist from the Commonwealth of Nations, who will compete in the fifth World Championship at the 400 m hurdles, says it is "unprecedented" that 16 Scotland will be on the British team.
Scotland's top overall number of athletes at the previous World Championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, Muir led the middle-distance runner who broke five UK and two European records.
He'll join at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another Scot to watch Chris O'Hare, who has had a very good season including the British Team trials and victories in the Year-end Games, running at 1500 m.
Doyle remembers the first championship where the only other Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move that many of his teammates will not only join the team but in some cases will compete for the medal and fight to stay in the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that it was with the votes given by other members of the team, so it was already a huge honour, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me."
“I’m proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
This shows how far we have come.
And they're here, as self-proved athletes, as athletes who try to get on the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
“I’ve taken advantage of the fact that we’re very lucky in this situation, that there’s a World Championship in our house.
I mean, it's actually just the effect of being able to take advantage of this in-field support and being successful with the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I’m taking a second chance to go out there and fight and there’s going to be such a great atmosphere.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Candidates for state duty if you can’t remove voters’ criticisms
The father of our country had some information about taking a negative place in the press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him harshly about everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was bothered by the criticism.
The critics did not silence him.
Because in 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be abolished and we can be dragged to the shore in a stupid and silent way.”
That brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the sharing of at least 450 people who expressed their ideas on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff didn't care because the case was serious, and the online comments were filled with "who cares?" responses.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook."
But that's important.
This is especially important when you are someone like Hogan.
He's a Republican governor who's surprisingly popular in a state that's mostly Democrat.
Of the country's 50 governors, it has the second highest rate of turnover.
Hogan's not a crazy reaction lighter.
He led his state and showed mastery in his strict adherence to principles.
By presenting his hairless head after chemotherapy in a funny way, he was also quite proficient in using Facebook as his primary tool to connect with his voters.
That is, it is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people coming to the page of the government, which is a public forum, officially qualified and managed by staff members who pay public tax dollars.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s female spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, argued that blocking comments was nothing more than regulating them.
But it’s very easy to use images of trolls or spammers or people who hate online verbal attacks.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are the real people who speak only to their elected leaders: a teacher, a work-owner, and a priest; not a troll.
They all said their comments weren't respectful, thoughtful, and obscene.
The priest made a citation from the Bible, referring to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Maryland Bowie, wasn't full of hate but asked questions about his hate crimes.
He wrote to the Post's commentary section, "I've kindly made a comment that I'm disappointed in his hate crimes and other recent news."
“When I also comment on the same subject, I don’t like the idea that a large group of concerned citizens immediately ignore it as a collective effort.”
Others who the governor’s staff has called it a “intensified spam attack” will likely call it an “intelligence advocacy.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to make a message convenient by blocking an opponent or deleting a negative message.
The staff outside is much cleaner than the old days when they were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence protesters.
But digitally, that’s exactly what happened.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for deactivating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by the Twitter stream.
One of the decisions that could be referenced in the future came from Virginia last week.
The chairmanship of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors was in violation of the First Amendment when it banned a voter on Facebook, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s time, the reasonably priced postal period had a pretty similar effect on the internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and unknown letter writers stripped his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unknown trolls.
People using nicknames such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that underlined Washington's decisions.
According to the George Washington Articles Project, which collects historical documents online, the petitions office has been outraged by its stance on the Friendship, Trade and Transatlantic Agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, opposition, and freedom of speech are at the heart of our nation.
True leadership means to accept it as well.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his home will be at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. Ronan Rafferty hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be at home at the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, the Northern Irishman, who leads the next door, feels attached to the new venue and acts as the tournament’s ambassador on behalf of the founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, “I watched the construction of the Renaissance Club, and we see that it has come to prominence with this organization.”
Players will see the field at its best, in a state of turmoil.
Jerry's done a terrible job setting up this place.
He is an avid supporter of this game and is proud of his success here.
This is a great show for this field.”
Despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, Eales will for the first time in his 32-year career defend a championship.
The Southport-based player said, "It really feels special."
“I didn’t have a chance to defend the Extremadura Open because the next year I won was taken out of my calendar.
It's great to be back in this part of the world.
This is a great place to play golf.
Memories from last year are coming to life and it was so special to win for my wife Sharon last year.
It was a time that was truly special and always remembered with love.”
Gary Orr, who has been on the European Senior Tour since his 50th birthday earlier this year, is making a comeback on his own field.
This will be the first Scottish competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburgh man Orr said, “When you fight inside, it always means a little more meaning.”
“You want to do well, but you also feel the pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played base golf.
I'm glad you're gone so far."
Those who participated in the field were former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation is free and parking is available; <0xC2><0xA3>5 per vehicle with one person and <0xC2><0xA3>10 per vehicle with two or more people.

I found the answer.
Think of it as a "column"... with a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish lira, among them, Economics, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism, each of the eleven ministries of which are also represented by more than a dozen ministries.
Number of personnel 117,000 378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of the Dianetics!
Yes, I'm going to talk about President Mehmet Seemez!
I've been looking for answers to the question in my head for days.
I wonder why Mehmet Göremez was taken from his seat...
I've read every article that came out about his posting.
Oh, no.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
At the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Göremez has prepared the Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Diyanet Affairs (DIB) 2017-2021.
Under President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, the 1 million lira S 600 model Mercedes was withdrawn.
There was no problem with Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
So, what happened?
You might say, “He’s been in office for seven years.”
The first President of D<0xC4><0xB0>B, M. R<0xC4><0xB1>fat Börek<0xC3><0xA7>i, served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz has been in that seat for 11 years.
I mean, the president's term is open.
I ask again: Why did Mehmet Seems leave his seat?
He understood the work...
Proximity to Shia
A source close to the power said: "According to the traditional tradition, Mehmet did not have a sonnet!"
The code of this sentence is: He did not have sunnyness!
The person who used this sentence shrugged his back: "It was found modernist by traditional dressing!"
So, Mehmet Invisible was seen as an innovator.
What does innovation mean?
The answer to the question was hidden in a foreign trip of Mehmet Göremez.
Date: 27 December 2015.
Mehmet Göremez went to Iran to attend the 29th Witness Conference, which will be held in Tehran, aimed at approximating Islamic mosques.
He met with Iran’s religious leader Ayetollah Ali Hamaney.
He prayed with the people of the Shia religion.
And at the conference he said: "Messiahs are five schools that represent different ideas and traditions in the understanding of the religion of Islam, formed over time."
The purpose of all of this is to establish the will of God.
Each of them is on the same path, but they are on the same path.
It is never acceptable to meditate on the merits of worship or to see the merits of worship above the aid of Islam.
Disagreement, reunification and conflict are a reflection of the rise and ignorance.
The religion that was most damaged when the mosques were in front of the religion was itself.
I would like to re-emphasize the gold here:
The Shia and Sunni are one community.
“No one can deceive another because he perceives Islam as he understands it or does not live.”
A year later...
Only Caferi leader Selahattin <0xC3><0x96>zgünz attended the 30th Witness Meeting from Turkey.
I mean...
It's not sunny, it's vehement.
Mehmet Göremez’s visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of “traditional observance.”
This was the reason why no one was represented by the Turkish State at the next Tehran conference.
He hadn’t been invited four times since Mehmet G<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x93>z came to office.
The reason was obvious; Shia in ISIS - the anti-Iranian "traditional sedition!"
Immediately after the Iranian trip, the seat of Mehmet Göremez began to be demolished from the beginning of 2016.
At the beginning of this, the deputy prime minister, Numan, who was responsible for D<0xC4><0xB0>B, was rescued!
Mehmet Gj<0xC3><0xA1>mez was so drowned that he asked "to join the IDB Presidency."
It's all about...
There was a difference in the state's view of Sunniness.
Theoretical worlds, such as the “traditional vestige” created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, were identified with the Sunni-Vehhabi-Selfism in the shadow of the United States!
They were Iranian opponents who didn’t even have tahammulles on their trip to Tehran.
It was not surprising that the dubious Ahmet’s words about Mehmet Göremez were: “Diyanet did not come in danger from this.”
"O my Lord, let the people of your country and the people of your people do what is right and good."
They used "Ethnicity" as a symbolic concept of Iranian hostility.
For a time FET<0xC3><0x96>, backed by the CIA, was now running new names against Iran.
In addition, with FET<0xC3><0x96> buddies...
A photo of a young man with a whiskey in his hand was served to the media with the lie "Son of Mehmet Gözmez"!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Gözmez in the media: the newspaper of the U.S.-led Illuminati Society Turkey!
After all...
- Sunni, who can't resist bringing it to Saudi Arabia's Vehhabi-Selefi line...
- Who doesn't blur the segregation...
- Modernist... a religious man was destroyed by the "traditional sedition" created by his conscience during the Cold War period...
U.S. cultural imperialism continues to rapidly arouse Turkey (to make Vehhabi-Selefi).
Do not doubt that the future President of Diyanet Affairs will be the Vehhabi-Selefi representative!
"We support the preservation of the sovereignty of Turkey."
Foreign Minister Mevlüt <0xC4><0x8C>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu visited China for an official visit.
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi held a joint press meeting with Sergeant Sergeant Sergeant Sergeant Sergeant Sergeant-in-Chile in Beijing’s state-run Konukevi.
"We hope that Turkey will be more actively involved in international affairs," Vang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to maintain sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinians will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey," he said.

The spiritual begins its second period.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden World
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove when cooking.
He seldom even uses a cap.
The housewife places a sweet potato in a wooden house in Enarotali, Paniai, in the restless region of Indonesia, usually locally known as "nota" directly on fire.
Half an hour later, he gets a stab wound, and he's licked and swiped, and he hasn't washed his hands.
Degei lives on muddy ground where he does laundry with muddy water from the nearby basin, he has no furniture.
A bucket in a roofless house serves as a saccharine candle.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was never assigned to any field.
Shame is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and most drink a lot, and there are soldiers.
"Nobody walks around the village after 5:00 p.m.," he says.
A rare snapshot of everyday life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969, after a controversial referendum that only 1026 years old was forced to vote by force before the invasion of the Unions.
He directed the Jakarta government to ban foreign journalists or law enforcement organizations, which quickly maintain strict control of the region, a move that promotes independence against the Dutch government.
In 2003, the area was formally separated from Papua New Guinea by Papua and West Papua, which would occupy the eastern part of the island.
The journey here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital of Jayapur to Nabire and a 5-hour drive from the stomach with a rental car.
No public transportation.
The 19,000-seater cottage includes wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, converted into various shades of brown brown by rusted iron roofs.
Let the journalists know that very few Indonesians have traveled here, and almost no foreigner has traveled here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, Mee Pago found the Papuans to a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
Degei, meanwhile, has a vibrant, hand-woven velvet, dark shirt, and shiny heel, says, "We weren't used to wearing these clothes."
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have the worst half-death and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's golden land.
Grasberg, the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous area of the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport exported about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua has an estimated reserves of $78 billion.
Luckily, these riches, which are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensure that Indonesia's powerful army maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study by the New York Times reported that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in grants to a single sub.
The Papuans' call for more autonomy threatens this golden-egg chicken and comes from their rights mercilessly.
According to rights advocates, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned.
In the mountainous regions of Papua, mass killings in the 1970s reached genocide figures, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
The Brisbane Archdiocese’s 2016 “We’ll Lose Everything” report, which saw the brutal extermination of violent demonstrations, such as last year’s illegal executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric executions are particularly popular) and peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims because there are events every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at the Human Rights Watch.
The sources of Papua increased the pressure as they brought settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The region's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian but the population of Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi is changing as Muslim immigrants arrive for economic purposes.
Javanese warung buffets sell gado-gado served with roasted chicken and ground peanut sauce mixed with vegetables.
The locals are struggling to compete.
“Immigrants sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than native Papuans in traditional markets,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to the regional capital Jayapur for work.
"This led to the loss of the native Papuans, the Papuan mama-mama (women) on the market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, vowed to resolve inequalities and violations of rights in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter took 27 of Papua's 29 provinces, including Panaia, as he progressed along the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua and today the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hope that justice will be restored," You said.
In fact, Paniai was in his worst condition only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas songs in front of a festive fire in Enarotali, where two Indonesian military darkness broke out on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to open their candles.
One of the soldiers included their styles and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Victims and eyewitnesses said they were chasing a group of soldiers who had taken alcohol and beating their rifles with their dips.
Then one of the soldiers shot the boy group.
One of the children, 16-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he went into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the next day events escalated.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They carried the seasonal hunting springs and performed the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (running in public form and mimicking bird fluttering).
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military garrison.
As the nerves became even more tense, the internal radio sent an order to the soldiers: "If the crowd resists more than three times, kill them by shooting." An official paper, seen by TIME, which was not disclosed to the local media, said so.
Jeremiah Kayame (56), head of Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for peace by burning the crowds home.
No one was going to listen.
He told TIME at the presentation of his brightly-painted wooden house, "I was suddenly hit by my left wrist when I turned my back."
He still doesn't know who fired it, but he says the bullet came from a military source.
"It was a shell, it was shot many times," he adds.
According to his cousin, Alfius Youw, who witnessed the attacks, was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, John, who is only known by the same name, told TIME “I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it wasn’t him.”
"I saw him die... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only "secured the station" because the station was under attack.
A spokesman for the Papuan police branch, Pudjo Sulistio, said in 2015, “We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us.”
"It's a matter of death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi gave an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura three weeks later, stating that he shared the pain of the victims' families and promised that he would resolve the historic upheavals in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he had set up an unwarranted mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the offenses were long ago.
Some in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but there are processes that we have to go through.”
Wiranto, speaking to TIME on June 5, stepped back, saying he had no plan to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will all be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who advocated "crimes against humanity" with more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been resolved.
The families of the Paniai victims have met with a painful suspicion of such claims.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there’s been no progress,” says John.
"I'm tired."
Years later, he says he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by soldiers, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Jacobus repeats the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bells, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at the villagers in Deiyai, a neighbour of Paniai.
One person was killed in a clash with a construction company manager who refused to help a man who was not in his care to be taken to the hospital, and 17 others were injured.
Ravianus Douw, 24, drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died while going to the hospital.
Angry peasants protested in front of the company's headquarters.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the officers and reacted by firing a warning.
But the locals say that the mob (the Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
Dominggu Badii, a 29-year-old man who lives close to the hospital and has seen the injured raised, told TIME, “We were very panicked, we were afraid of revenge.”
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament called for the arrest of the officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile police force from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living scattered throughout Papua's green mountainous center.
Many of them joined the Free Papuan Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of the Papuans through random attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some senior OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and enjoyed by soldiers in recent years under the guise of “protection of national sovereignty.”
Some will never be seen again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place."
Poverty feeds into dissatisfaction.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is unreachable.
The people here grow everything they eat: mainly note as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can execute sweet potatoes from four or five fields.
They usually store most of the harvest for the family, selling the rest on the local market.
10 notes only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papuans and the Nabire Airport have increased since the opening of new air routes to more and more new immigrants.
Already fewer jobs usually go to migrants who are better educated and richer.
It is very rare for Papuans to have the capital or qualifications necessary to conduct their own business competitively.
John Gobai, chairman of the Panai tribal council, said, “Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no job or money here.”
Tecrit keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, the restrictions on news coverage for the international media are strictly in place.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were seldom given their permission to shoot videos, but were expelled from Papua due to a "lack of coordination with relevant institutions."
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Asia, Jokowi’s campaign to increase transparency has not been met with news restrictions and development promises.
In a statement, he said: “There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Papua and West Papua to Indonesia’s restless eastern extremist provinces: visa refusal and blacklisting.”
The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to neighbours close to Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands) encouraged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir told reporters in Jakarta, "The democratic system in Indonesia is still valid and the media is free, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence in human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take an interest.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4, the country's ambassador for human rights, Kees Van Baar, a source who attended the meeting and did not want his name to be announced said, "We want freedom."
Indonesia has yet another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
Gobai, the head of the tribal council, said: “Jokowi is a person with good intentions but is surrounded by people who are involved in the Panian attack.”
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that, in addition to living under the imminent threat of a tyrannical soldier, he is surrounded by education and health services.
Gobai says the Panian people, like the other Papuans, see it as a "debt" they gave Jokowi to pay back their votes.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack took action against a final symbolism: burying a victim’s body in the ground just across from the police and military station.
They will make sure that at least those responsible don’t forget their crimes, knowing that justice can never be enforced.
“A member of our family has been killed,” says Jacobus, leaning his head forward.
"What else can we do?"
The fire has wrapped up Dubai's 'Messiah' skyscraper for the second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday smashed the world’s tallest masonry towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee 79-story structures 337 meters in length.
This is the second major fire that quickly spread to the tall building called the Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tower in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no explanations were given as to the cause of the fire.
“We were sleeping and waking up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the 50th floor," he told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil defense authorities said the fire crew had extinguished the large fire at around 4:00 a.m. local time and were cooling the building.
The government has announced that they are trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This event could re-arrange questions about the safety of the material used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Fire Department following the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was in the exterior panels used for decoration and insulation.
Police in the United Kingdom said they believed that the insulation and coating panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
News of 'social assistance' for more than 4 thousand chronic patients
The Ministry of Family and Social Policy will start a social assistance program for the poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases, in the first phase 4,300 patients with tuberculosis and SSPE will benefit.
With the assistance program, the Ministry, which plans to provide patients with over two-thirds of the minimum wage on a monthly basis, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information obtained, the details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Combating Chronic Diseases", which began its work some time before the instruction of the Minister of Family and Social Policy, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, became clear.
The social assistance programme, launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to fight chronic diseases and to support economically and psychologically challenged citizens, also carries the trait of being a first in the world in many ways.
The Ministry, which completes all the necessary preparations for the launch of the program, will provide regular psychosocial support not only to families through the social assistance program.
Thus, the aim is not to leave the poor citizens who are chronically ill and who continue their treatment processes in their homes, both financially and spiritually, alone.
According to the studies conducted, in the first stage, a disease of tuberculosis and a brain disease caused by measles microbiome, Subacute Sclerosis Panencephalitis (SSPE) will be regularly psychosocial and supportive to poor citizens under the new social assistance program.
In the later stages of the programme, poor citizens struggling with other rare and risky diseases will be included in the aid programme.
In addition to the support planned to be given at a rate of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, in addition to the fact that they are not able to go to medical self-care, that they have maintained their lives depending on the bed, or the need to improve their living conditions at home will be established by the relevant health unit.
In order to be able to benefit from the support, the minimum monthly salary per person in the household is required to be less than two-thirds of the net monthly amount.
In addition, citizens who have SSPE should have a report of the health board regulated according to the method and principles set out in the "Measurement of Apology, Classification and Regulation on Health Board Reports to be given to the Apologets."
According to the survey, more than 1 in 5 U.S. passengers bring banned substances to the plane
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly abducted prohibited substances from U.S. Department of Transportation checkpoints into the plane, including at least 6 percent carrying prohibited blades or other sharp objects without knowing it.
Less than 1 percent later claimed to have realized that they accidentally traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A survey of more than 1,000 people conducted by Stratos Jet Charters has also found that younger passengers are more prone to breaking the rules.
Among the participants who admitted that they tried to fly knowingly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were from the Y generation, while less than 15 were from the X generation.
The most common substances that are deliberately abducted from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly going through safety cuts, while 2.2 percent of female participants and 3.7 percent of male participants also admitted knowingly carrying illegal drugs on the plane.
The company said it had surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many people accidentally brought smuggled goods from airport security and who did so knowingly.
It’s no surprise that knowingly or unknowingly smuggling goods from security is most likely to be the most flying people.
Yet, as the company noted, the TSA rules are a bit tricky and confusing.
People are often not sure what fluids they can carry or how much of them they can carry.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of substance taken by TSA appears as prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be treating books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but are not allowed on international flights.
China welcomed U.S. statements positively
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi, at a press conference held in the capital Beijing, referred Tillerson to the Pyongyang administration "to send the regime change, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula and the reunification of our troops to the north of the 38th parallel."
China’s Secretary of State Vang reiterated Tillerson’s Washington administration’s principles regarding the North Korean issue, saying it hoped the US would effectively and effectively implement those principles in a result-oriented policy.
Bearing in mind that the security of the Korean peninsula is a priority, Vang expects the parties to find a middle ground to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration is also clearing the peninsula from nuclear debris, preserving peace and stability through dialogue and dialogue.
EPA President Pruitt Refuses to Defer Obama’s Period Emissions Reduction Laws
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency President Scott Pruitt withdrew the decision to delay the implementation of Obama’s earlier law, which reduced emissions of pollutants that caused dirt to smoke.
Pruitt represented the change with his own organization being more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous administrations.
He never mentioned the issue of legal objections to his previous position in a federal high court.
The states will begin to meet the deadline of October 1, which is the end of the 2015 standards for ozone floor level.
Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance by one year in June to give his organization more time to work on the plan and “interfere with local decisions or prevent economic growth.”
Prior to President Donald Trump’s appointment, Pruitt, Oklahoma’s Attorney General, had long served as a reliable ally against tighter environmental regulations.
Pruitt has repeatedly taken action since coming to Washington to block or delay regulations against which the chemical and fossil fuel industries are opposed.
Wednesday's abrupt change, Pruitt's latest legal defeat for his agenda to regain regulation.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA director’s attempt to oversee and delay the application of methane leaks by oil and gas companies, an Obama administration law, that requires it to push beyond its own authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that the return to ozone standards reinforced EPA’s commitment to work with states only on time to meet new standards and through complex processes.
Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous work, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often fails to meet the final dates of decisions, waits for them to be sued by activist groups and others, and remains in disagreement to set timetables for the decision."
“We don’t believe in regulating through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously.”
However, the EPA’s statement stated that Pruitt could once again use “the power of deterrence and all other powers legally available” at one point to ensure that regulations are “supported by sound policies and the best information available.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider rewriting of the ozone laws.
A bill passed last month by the Assembly is seeking to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate to vote.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who leads the coalition of states that are suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: “Following our cases, the EPA’s decision-making is a significant contribution to the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the dirt smoke coming into their communities.”
The case involved New York City, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and the District of Columbia.
When cars, power plants, petroleum refineries, chemical plants, and other sources responding to sunlight in the atmosphere, general pollutants emit ozone at ground level.
The dirt smoke that emerges can cause severe breathing problems in a rapidly affected group of people, and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applaud Pruitt's surprise decision change.
Lori Ann Burd, from the Center for Biological Diversity, said: “It is disturbing that so much pressure is needed from the person responsible for protecting the air we seek to achieve this sensible step.”
“We must continue to fight the ideological struggle of the Trump administration against those who pollute the environment and vilify interest groups.”
Inflation is a key factor
Turkey, which recorded the largest increase in exports in 6 years in July, had a unemployment rate of 13 per cent in October, and an economic confidence index of 10.5 per cent in April, and a peak of 3.5 years, also reduced inflation to a single household.
According to data released yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Agency (TÜIK), the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose 0.15 percent in July, while annual inflation fell to the single household for the first time since October with 9.79 percent.
As of July, the largest increase in monthly spending was seen in the restaurant and hotel group with 1.75 percent, while the group with the most declines was the clothing and footwear group with 3.51%.
The highest increase on an annual basis occurred in the transport group with 15.24 percent.
In July, Muammer Kölürcüo<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Business Investment Economist, noting that inflation has fallen to a single household, parallel to expectations, said: “The moderate trend in inflation has an effect on the decline in food and clothing groups’ prices.”
But in the nucleus indicators, there is an increase compared to the previous month.
"We do not expect the Central Bank to have a relaxation in its tight position," he said.
Despite the decline in cuff inflation, there was an increase in core inflation indicators.
The B index rose from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 percent to 9.60 percent from the special comprehensive TUFE indicators closely monitored by the Central Bank.
Enver Erkan, Capital FX Research Assistant Director, said that inflation could be shut down from 9.3 percent a year, "until the month of December, inflation could fall into a single household in December."
"The Central Bank will be able to take the opportunity as early as the first months of 2018," the statement said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek: He will close the inflation year with a single household.
The tightening of the Central Bank will continue until inflation drops below 7%.
We will give the reforms their final form in the forthcoming Food Committee.
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased that inflation is falling to a single figure, but it must become permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices need to be reduced, as well as increased supply.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: An upward trend in annual inflation may be seen in the coming months due to the base effect, but the fall in inflation will be marked from the first months of 2018.
We anticipate that annual inflation will go down even further.
I wish Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e success in the next match.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said that their performance in the second half of the match with Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e in the UEFA Europa League 3 preliminary round was not enough to skip the turn.
Speaking at a press conference held after the meeting, Foda pointed out that Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e was a top-level team, "We couldn't use the wings in the first half."
In the second half, we set the balance.
We got a chance for the second goal.
I’m still proud of my team.
They changed the flow of the game in the second half.
We could've been a little better.
Little things were decisive in the game.
"I wish Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e success in the next game," he said.
Foda said that while they were in Turkey, they felt very well and were happy because of the hospitality they saw.
Fernando in <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul
The Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who started transfer talks with Galatasaray Club, arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer, who arrived at Ataturk Airport, was greeted enthusiastically by fans.
Fernando, who was in a show of love by yellow-red fans, drove off from the airport in a private car waiting for him under security measures.
30-year-old Fernando, who started his career with Brazil’s Vila Nova team and wears the Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City forms, works in the midfield.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after undergoing health checks.
Galatasaray, who continues his transfer work, has made a deal with Manchester City for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,250,000 for Fernando, whom he has been trying to join for a long time.
Flash Rakka move from the U.S.: Internal Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who is affiliated with the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) with the administration of video conferences from Baghdad, said the coalition-trained Rakka Internal Security Force (RIGG) had begun to settle in areas cleared of DEASH in the city.
"The Rakka Homeland Security Force, which is mostly composed of Arabs and local volunteers against the DEA, continues to ensure order and prevent terrorists from fleeing or returning in the cleaned areas of the city," Dillon said.
This week, Dillon said 230 people had joined the group by completing their training, adding that “the number of the force in question is 850 so far.”
Dillon said the coalition had trained the group on basic weapons training, as well as on first aid, armed conflict, scanning and checkpoint operations.
Reporting that Rakka's interest in the Internal Security Force is very intense, Dillon noted that the coalition will continue to scan applicants for training and employment.
The US-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which forms the main backbone of the PYD/PKK in the takeover of Rakka.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization had appointed the PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammad as the co-chairman of the Rakka Civil Management Council.
It is alleged that the PKK/PYD members will also be part of the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also announced that he had collected heavy weapons from the rebel group Shuheda Karyateyn (Shuuk) at the Al-Taniif camp in southern Syria, which was cut off by the U.S.-led coalition last week.
"After meeting with the leaders last week, Shuuk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition gave them, but some small arms and light vehicles were allowed to remain in them," Dillon said.
The U.S. said last week that it had withdrawn its support from Shuuk on the grounds that it had gone out of its conflict zones and patrolled and was involved in non-combat activities with the DEASH.
It is stated that the group wants to fight against the DEASH regime as well as the Bashar al-Assad regime.
According to a leaked phone call, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked notes by the Washington Post.
In a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump slammed him for not telling the public that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president punished the Mexican president who held the ball publicly on the wall and said, “You can’t tell the press.”
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the U.S. southern border, and promised Mexico he would pay for the project.
Notes of his first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which sparked a heartfelt dialogue, were also published.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that the U.S. deal to take refugees to Australia was "masculine", "corrupt" and "stupid" and that the deal under the Obama administration would show itself as "stupid" after he offered the U.S. a ban on asylum.
Mr. Trump ended his speech to Mr. Turnbull by saying, “It wasn’t the nastiest speech I’ve had all day.”
Patients have broken the doctor’s nose.
Doctors and employees of Turkey Higher Education and Research Hospital left short-term work yesterday morning in response to the crushing of a doctor’s colleagues by a patient’s relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital, with the words "no to violence against health" in their hands, reacted to the incident.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Ay<0xC5><0x9F>enur Pa<0xC3><0xA7>, Head of Clinical Cardiology at the Children’s Hospital, says the slogan “No to violence in health” seems to me inadequate or even a side slogan.
In health, there is no place for violence.
"If it goes this way, this people will soon find no health group to serve themselves," he said.
Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Director of Health, Ankara Province, General Secretary of Public Hospitals of Ankara First Region, Prof. Dr. Oner Odaba<0xC5><0x9F>, Turkish Higher Educational Education and Research Hospital, Dr. Mustafa Pa<0xC3><0xA7>, is also in charge of the Department of Health.
Condemning the incident, Pac said:
Unfortunately, the violence against health workers is increasing.
An example of this is that last night (the previous day) we were re-experienced by our cardiac surgeon being crushed by a patient’s close friend.
We call on our government, our ministry, and our government to take the measures we can take to put an end to these events immediately, and to increase the sensitivity of our people in this regard.
I'm telling you what happened yesterday on behalf of my hospital and my health care staff.
Odaba<0xC5><0x9F>, who drew attention to the need for public awareness of violence in health, said, "Unfortunately, this time we have experienced, has become a professional complication."
"We will also take our own measures, but most importantly, our nation has its own health care worker," he said.
Turkmen also said that the legal process for the incident had begun, "Our laws on violence in health have come up effectively enough."
The state legislature implements this.
He's currently working on security.
In the past, it was always empty, but now it's a direct public case, and the state is hiring a lawyer, following the case.
"There are also examples of severe punishments taken in this regard," he said.
After the explanations, the workers continued their work.
The incident allegedly took place at 5:45 p.m. the day before.
Intensively, the patient's relatives who lost their lives attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet <0xC3><0x96>zbek, who worked in the Department of Heart and Ventricular Surgery, who reported death.
While Uzbek was being removed from the scene by doctors and assistants, police were called to the hospital.
The attackers were arrested while the Uzbeks' noses were broken.
One of the witnesses to the incident, a doctor, said:
When our friend went to his sick relatives to report the condition of a life-threatening patient, he took our friend and our sick relatives from the condition and attacked our two friends.
Our friend's nose was broken, she was in blood.
Then we took our friend into the operating room and hid it.
He pulled a security set between us for 15-20 minutes.
If the patient's relatives had crossed that security wall, there would have been much worse things.

YPG rains in Syria
The U.S. intervened
According to information obtained by the AA from local sources, YPG terrorists, with U.S. military support, raided homes in the northern countryside of Rakka, where the terrorist organization entered the DEAS on the grounds of fighting, the residents of the Tel-Semitic countryside.
The reaction of the civilians, who were looting their homes and laying their hands on them, turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
On top of that, US forces in the region entered the country with armoured vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armored vehicles, personnel carriers and Husky type mine detection vehicles were seen to form buffer zones in the country.
The YPG, a terrorist organization, does not allow civilians fleeing their deaths in Rakka, which is under fire as part of an anti-ISIS operation.
A local network of activists called "Rakka is being quietly massacred" announced that 121 civilians were killed in the organization's shelling in July alone.
Let's not move the old world's fights to tomorrow
Delayed perception of home and world realities can cause countries to be dragged into crises, not just by ordinary people.
One of the reasons for the late perception of world truths by the backward East as "charism" may be that these truths are obstructed by certain fires or actually revealed in a way that is beyond the real world.
Don Kisot and Oblomov have also been the subject of the literary world to perceive or not perceive the facts and change at a later date.
Cervantes' "Don Quixote" is a matchup who still considers himself a knight when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Gon<0xC3><0xA7>arov’s “Oblomov” is a lazy legacy that thinks that everything can last as it once did when it came to ignoring the facts.
For example, while China was an open country to the world and dominating the seas until the end of the 15th century, it was closed to the result of a holding dynasty crossing the throne.
This situation lasted until the execution of the captains of the boats that came out of Chinese mainland waters.
We Turks, located in one foot, the eye and the ear in the West, the other foot, the eye and the ear in the East, have experienced constant dilemmas about perceiving facts and change starting with the Ottomans.
We tried to move an old and a new chapter into today, to understand today with concepts that conform to the old conditions, to think tomorrow.
We were a division, we were able to act as fast as the mindset in developed countries in terms of perception of both home and world realities and change.
This situation has been a constant source of conflict and tension.
With Medrese, the university, the modern army, the newer ones, the encounters of doubt with the faith, caused a dramatic contentious dualism.
Even worse, it was not accepted that in a period of time, new and advanced attitudes would eventually become obsolete and lag behind.
After a period of time, yesterday’s pioneers began to declare the new and advanced “dangerous”, the country and the world conditions in an up-to-date way consistent with reality.
The most important lesson in the Ottoman Empire was that those who later perceived the realities of the homeland and the world would finally dominate thought and state life, the empire would eventually disintegrate, collapsed, and the people would become impoverished.
The most important lesson that our Ottoman past conveyed to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of world conjunctivity and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Because this lesson is very well received, we could have been the exemplary country of this geography that has been able to maintain its unity, integrity and stability in peace since World War I until today.
In order for us to get through the process of global change, which has entered a different approach, right and securely, we need to leave behind and act in line with the facts.
In other words, no one will benefit from moving the meaningless camps and blood cases that have led to the accumulation of our democracy in the past.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today’s world lead to very large and dramatic crises.
The most difficult geography in this regard is the Middle East in which we are located.
History of the operation in Mush
In a statement issued by the governor, it was reported that an operation was carried out by the teams of the Provincial Gendarmerie Command regarding the smuggling of historical works.
And he said to them, “I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven and to the power of the Father, and to the glory and the power of the Son, and to the glory and the power of the Father, and to the glory and the power of the Lord, for the glory and the power of the Lord, for the glory and the power of the Lord, for the glory and the power of the Lord God.”
"Our operations to combat crime and criminals for the peace and security of our people will be continued with determination," it said.
Wind (Turkey)
The global giants, confident of Turkey’s future, struggled to break through the wind turbine crash that took place yesterday.
The auction broke the world record for the model set by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing its external dependence.
With the bid to lower Turkey’s energy costs, a $1 billion investment and close to 4 jobs opened the way.
By 2019, domestic production wind turbines will be included in the system.
Eight consortia, including giants from the U.S., China, Germany and Denmark, participated in the licensing of renewable sources (YEKA) opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
In the auction, financial tender envelopes were opened in order to identify the 5 bidders who first made the lowest bid.
After the first bid envelope, the lowest bid was $4.19 per kilowatt-hour.
The clear ejection range was set at 0.01 cents.
Following the start of the auction, Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to participate in the open excise of the joint venture groups.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the open exilation.
Following the withdrawal of Nordex’s consortium, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon remained the last two.
MingYang-First Construction took a break 11 times.
The Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Energy consortium has never taken a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: Record Day for Turkey.
The open extermination continued for 30 laps.
The winner of the intense dispute between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest bid at $3.48 per kilowatt-hour.
While the consortium offered $3.49 per kilowatt-hour in the auction, Deputy Assistant Alparslan pulled the bid to 3.48 at the request of the auction commission headed by Bayraktar.
With the outcome of the two-hour YEKA competition, Turkey achieved a world record.
The price of $3.48 per kilowatt-hour offered in the auction was the lowest in the world in this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84/cent per kilowatt-hour.
Berat Albayrak, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, who organized the press conference after the announcement, pointed out that the victory of the German company Siemens is an important message to the region and the world, "We are proud of the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany."
Our goals are big.
The result that emerged today has revealed how robust and confident the economy and energy market is going to be in the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to announce that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world’s most reliable investment countries.
"All of Turkey, which we will be proud of as 80 million, is our President, who brings Turkey to this point, with the greatest contribution of 15 years of power and leadership," he said.
Open, transparent and competitive with the bid to start a new period, Colonyrak said: "One of the most important steps of this is to buy a third dollar/cent per kilowatt-hour in real terms, with the local contribution to the wind by yesterday." with a real cost of 10.3 dollars/cent per kilowatt-hour, per year.
I am proud of this, on behalf of my people, on behalf of my country.
Minister Colonel, pointing out that they aim to put into operation the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018, "I hope that by 2019 we will also include our domestic production wind turbines in the system."
The turbines will be installed in five designated zones.
The winning company will receive a total of one thousand megawatts of board power in each of these five regions, with the condition of establishing a wind power of at least 50 megawatts in each of the five regions.
The Siemens-Turks-Kalyon Group will have a total investment of over $1 billion.
With local wind turbines going into operation, a minimum of 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be generated each year and about 1.1 million homes will be supplied with electricity from the wind.
The wind turbines will also provide an average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/year reduction.
The company that won the competition will build a factory with an investment of over $100 million.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines, with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
At least three of the consortium’s software and innovative gearbox fields will work in R&D in a total of 5 areas for 10 years in the design, wing, generator, material technologies and production techniques.
With a budget of $5 million each year for R&D, 80 percent of the technical staff, made up of local engineers, will work.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The duration of the project is 30 years.
Kaz<0xC4><0xB1>m Türker, Chairman of the Management Board of Turks Construction, which is in the winning consortium, states that the domestic production in the project will be around 64 percent, while 35% of the equipment will come from abroad, while the project plans to finance equipment from foreign sources.
The Turkish said the auction reflected confidence in the Turkish economy.
Mr Murtaza Ata, chairman of Kalyon Holding Energy Group, said: “It has been an auction to reduce Turkey’s dependence on the outside by a thousand megawatts.”
“We’re happy with the outcome,” he said.
Hakan Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m, Senior Manager of SIEMENS Gamesa Turkey, said that he has been operating in Turkey for 160 years, “We will do our best to further reduce the cost of electric units.”
The locality rate of wind turbines to be produced at the plant will be at least 65 percent.
Of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine, 65 percent will be domestic (at least 5,200 pieces).
At least 50 MW will be installed in each of the 5 zones, with a total of 1000 MW.
The R&D requirement of 10 years of employment for 3,750 people will be allocated to R&D activities of $5 million each year
1,000MW Wind Power Plant 65% Locality Ratio Production of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines at at least 2.3 MWe power.

Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Resuscitated Racist Lynch Case for Call to Justice
The 1948 model a Ford Mercury was passed through a group of spectators in rural Monroe Georgia and proceeded to push towards the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
A car with four black passengers and a white driver came forward to close the road before a group of armed white men reached the bridge.
He took a long breath from the cigarette of the gang leader, a man in a medium-aged thin-lined outfit, and looked carefully inside the front window.
Inside, those who were sitting were frightened.
"We want this, Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
As a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat, the screams went through the darkness.
Luckily, this horrifying scene played on June 22 is just a remake.
But when a sci-fi was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience breathed in a pretty realistic way.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have returned to Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom with George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organise the revival, said: “Even if we see them in our societies, it doesn’t make sense that not a single person has been arrested all these years, although we know who they are.”
"A stain in this history, but a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Georgia congressman and a lifelong human rights defender.
For him, this revival carries a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder that an injustice has never been corrected to the Monroe society.
He said: "We want remand, we want results, we want wounds to be wound, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice."
"We can't have the wound wrapping and the reconciliation until we get justice."
On July 27, 1946, a forensic officer lays a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Ford lining in Moore.
According to the FBI files obtained by NBC News, Monroe and more than 50 men were suspected of lynching from the surrounding areas.
But none of them have ever been investigated.
While the suspects have been fugitives for decades, human rights defenders say the twin motivations of lynxes are always well known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the by-election for the first time at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, at almost the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom apparently stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, about a woman.
Brooks stated that the town's rumor was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray went to prison at George Dorsey's rehab.
But when they got to the Ford Bridge in Moore when they got out of the prison by car, a lynx gang wrapped around the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It appears that Harrison was the one who arranged the murders and ordered them."
"It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between the state and local security forces that not only took part in the murder, destroyed the evidence, and concealed the identities of witnesses."
Brooks was shorter and told himself.
He said: "This was a massacre of the right to vote."
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'This is what happens if you register and vote.'"
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been managing the revival of Ford Bridge lenses in Moore, which takes place every year.
Its performance takes into account all the details, it’s eye-catching, and it’s based on a kind of deep racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn his gaze around, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lentils because it confronts all of us with the ugly in us."
"But if you don't listen to me or you don't listen to what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
The rehearsals of this year’s production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) filled up in a room and when Greene willingly entered the well-proven general lines of the game, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
He has played the role of President Klansman over the years, but he says the role has never been easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel upset because that's not me."
“But I think it’s important to keep this past alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
Throughout the room, actors playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona were rehearsing their own lines.
The game begins with Malcom yelling at Hester that he's so angry that he's sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
"Z....i, get out of my property!"
Rascona responds.
There's a gunshot.
And then everyone (at least black actors) drowns in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona asked, "What?"
He was nervous, he was surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene said "no" in the cracks.
"I don't think white people just said "Z" at the time."
One of the black players threw a mixed stone with the joke saying "yes."
"You've got to push R."
So the energy in the room changes and some kind of sincerity takes the place of restlessness.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the vigor of the game, but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, Rascona says the word beginning with N, sharp and accentuated.
No one's smiling.
The resuscitation ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in the funeral black stands on the bodies of the actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad metaphor "Strange Fruit."
It breaks his voice in one of the two words.
A hundred yards behind, an average group of four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The viewer is almost equally divided, being black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of the way forward.
While Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the Malcoms and Dorseys' cemeteries, they all relied on Georgia's oppressive nemesis for almost eight hours.
To this point, the murders had remained an anecdote, but standing in the same place where the lynx is now meant to make the air look cursed.
As the last notes of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to examine their rapprochement and their bodies.
The children crawl on their hands, smear fake blood and motionless bodies, and whisper to each other.
A little boy whispers, "They're not really dead," as he reminds himself.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd and it's over.
Actors throw away the lynx stick and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in a suit playing President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his playmates and leaves age in their arms, the emotional cost of his performance finally comes to him.
One of the women whispers, "It's all right."
“We know that’s not what’s in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sat down for dinner with the actors.
At a table, the white couple from Atlanta is chatting fiercely about resuscitating with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words about how her performance feels to her.
He said, "These terrible, terrible words and those behaviors... come from people who are like you and they do them because they are like you."
"What this has done to me is that the lynchings are still going on," he added, "they are now called just police-armed attacks."
At the end of the room, Tyrone is eating at the brooks table and telling about human rights memories.
He said he’s already starting to plan for next year’s performance.
He said, “Re-invigoration is inspiring in a way because it describes what we’re stuck with, but it’s also instructive.”
"Perhaps if you don't learn from this, it might be like this again.
Those who do not explore their own past, those who do not know their own past, are doomed to repeat it.”

Pearson pulls out of 3,000 jobs to revive the business, cuts its share of profits
British training group Pearson said on Friday it would do more than 3,000 jobs and cut its interim snow share by 72 percent, while starting another restructuring program to overcome the company’s face-to-face pressures.
According to CEO John Fallon, the withdrawals, which will mostly be in late 2018 and early 2019, will be in addition to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to save more than <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) by attempting to quickly relaunch digital learning with a third cost reduction program.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in this year’s outlook after reporting its baseline sales increased by <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half.
Text 2 has led to death again!
According to the forensic agency's first report, Hakan's preliminary autopsy report found that he committed suicide.
In the detailed examination, no scars and pocket marks were found on the child's body.
The reason for the suicide is that the elastic bandage, which passes through the neck, is compressed as a result of breathlessness.
It was also determined that the candle, which his family identified as a wrapping cloth, was an elastic bandage used in injuries.
According to Newspaper Habertürk, after the preparation of the detailed report on the death of the child, it was learned that the report, which stated that the incident was suicide, would be sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Gyük<0xC3><0xA7>mece, which carried out the investigation.
While the police are investigating the child's suicide in full detail, examinations on the handheld computer are also ongoing after the incident.
The police will also appeal to Hakan's friends.
It is also stated that the information obtained from the Hakan's computer, which his relatives called "Cleaned", can be accessed to third parties or a gang.
The police are assessing that Hakan may have been dragged by a suicide gang.
The certainty of Hakan's suicide turned his eyes into a Metin2, which included violence.
Reacting on the grounds of addiction and violence in children, Metin2, which was banned from the Antalya Governorate for children under 15 years, was also on the agenda with the murder of 13-year-old "mini hacker" Metin Kang in 2009.
In order to play "Metin2", which was designed in Korea in 2005, you need to log in and register for the site.
Players are trying to bring peace and justice to the world with the dragon god in the game.
When you do this, wars happen, the dose of violence increases.
The game also features battle images made with weapons such as lines, swords, blades, axes, and crazy weapons, as well as images of people being destroyed by wild animals.
The player buys characters with money to strengthen.
After the incident on July 25 in the house in the Esenyurt <0xC4><0xB0>stiklal district of Köknar Street, the family who took their children to the ground the next day continued the murder allegation.
When Father Mehmet Ekinci said, "All the dream was to be a doctor, we don't think it could harm him or anyone else because of the game," he said, "they hugged the elastic wrap around his neck and threw a knot to the side."
It was found that way, son.
We certainly don’t think that our son could hurt himself or anyone else because of a game over the internet and that he could commit suicide.
We knew he was playing a game like that.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's just say he got a little bored when he got out of the game.
Mother Gülizar Farmer said, “No one enters the building.”
It is said that at a certain time my child entered the house.
Neither of them hold each other.
There was only one chair when your brother came home.
"But when he was buried, there were two chairs next to the computer," he said.
Previous Previous post: He May Have Been Infected
Families generally don’t pay attention to this issue.
They look at me with their eyes, "Whatever happens to my child at home."
The child communicates with a lot of people through games.
There may have been a case of borrowing a loan, or swearing.
Or he invited a person in the game to the house, there may have been a problem between them.
It may not be directly from the game, but it may have been affected by problems with other people he has been in contact with through the game.
The child may have thought the visuality of the game, its fiction, real.
Suicidal trauma may be related to blackmail.
If the child is faced with the situation of complaining to the family, there is also a situation of being dragged into it because it cannot solve this problem.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game.
There's also the possibility of the kid getting involved in the gang.
He may have been infected with the gang.
Individually, it can't be something that the child could have done alone.
Information Systems Advisor Füsun NEB<0xC4><0xB0>L: Families should know the interaction of their children
We can't say games are harmful.
Research has also shown that games are beneficial for the development of children’s lives.
What is important here is that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to players online.
Parents should take precautions to know how children are affected by what content.
In Turkey, there are only two children in the five years that he died from the game.
This also shows that the end of a child’s life is not just the effect of games.
What did this kid do to it?
We need to find out first.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
The stock market is based on 50 percent of 8-month returns in Istanbul
The BIST 100 index, which began in December 2016, continued its upward trend in July and carried its upward trend to the top of the 8th month.
Thus, for the first time since July 2007, the index gained 45.3 percent in this period, while registering an 8-month rise above the top.
With its performance since the beginning of the year, the BIST 100 index, which left behind the world’s main exchanges, including Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, did not leave the lead on the basis of yields in July.
The Dow Jones index in the U.S. followed the BIST 100 index up by 7.06 percent in July, with a 2.54 percent increase, followed by the FTSE 100 index in the UK by 0.81 percent.
With the DAX index in Almaya, the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with a loss of value.
Looking at the January-October period, the BIST 100 index showed a high performance from both major world exchanges and emerging country exchange indices.
The Dow Jones index followed the BIST 100 index, which gained 37.6 per cent, with an increase of 10.76 per cent, the DAX index with a gain of 5.55 per cent, the Nikkei index with an increase of 4.55 per cent, and the FTSE 100 index with an increase of 3.21 per cent.
The MSCI EM index, which is an indicator of developing countries’ exchanges, provided yields of 23%.
In view of the historical process of the BIST 100 index, similar performance has been shown in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which was completed over the 8 months from December 2006 to July 2007, recorded an increase of 38.3 per cent during this period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index was completed on 8 August 1996 to March 1997, on 9 May 1997 to January 1998.
Eren Can Umut, Director of Investment Research, said in a statement to the AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, recording that the increase has exceeded 37% since the beginning of the year.
Overall, the MSCI emerging markets (EM) index recorded a 23% increase, noting that there was a positive divergence even when we looked at these rates:
The flow of funds to developing countries has been ongoing since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds within the search for high yields prefer countries that give higher interest rates.
As a result, domestic markets have a positive impact.
Of course, the appetite for risk on a global scale is also quite high.
As a result, stock indices that are in risky asset status are seen to improve.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 index has seen an increase of close to 11 percent since New Year’s Eve, and new record levels are being tested almost every week.
The UN, stressing that the U.S. Central Bank (Fed) forecast a 3% increase put markets under stress earlier this year, but using the Fed’s policy of verbal guidance rather well to eliminate uncertainty, noted that the Fed has a market that is insensitive to the interest rate increase.
The UN said inflation in the U.S. was not yet at the desired level, and that the Fed’s expectations that it would not act urgently on the interest rate increase and avoid radical moves were quite effective in current prices.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s perception that the health reform, known as “Obamacare,” will not be able to deliver on his promises of expanding financial policies is reinforced by the UN, saying, “No matter how much he has done, and the faster he has been given, the faster he will be given, and the more he will be given, the faster he will be given, and the more he will return to the stock market.
Recalling that 2016 was a year of many negatives in terms of the Turkish markets, Ümut said that the BIST 100 index, which dissipated negatively and sold overly, was in an effort to close the gap between them, according to the likes.
Reporting that they have not seen a strong recovery with the flow of domestic-sourced news, the UN noted that the current outlook could be interpreted as triggering the desire to close the gap between domestic markets according to the likes with an increase in risk-taking appetite abroad.
Umut technically noted that it tracked a number of snow sales in the BIST 100 index, which tested new records with 108,600 levels:
In particular, the area of 109,500-110,000 is a critical threshold in the short term.
Once these levels have been reached, it is normal for snow sales to take place.
In the short term, we believe that a new local or global story should be created for over 110,000 pricing.
For now, the downward shift of 107,500 support could trigger snow sales.
In this case, if we follow the 107,000 interim support, I think you can see relaxation up to 106,000-105,500 zones.
In particular, the break-up of 105,500 support could bring it back up to 104,300 levels, which is equivalent to Fibo’s 50 percent increase from 100,000 to 108,600 levels.
Noting that the decisions of both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be at the focal point of the global market, the UN expects the Fed to already be clear, but the FOMC may not expect an interest rate increase in September, although it expects the budget reduction programme to go into effect.
The United Nations said this could trigger profit sales in the stock indices of a developing country in the short term, which is in the shadow of over-purchase, and that "what is important is what the ECB will say."
Following the July meeting of the Monetary Policy Board, President Mario Draghi said that the course of monetary policy would be discussed in the fall, and this led to a rise above the 1,1700 level of the euro/dollar parity.
Statements that the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion monthly asset acquisition program will be reduced or possibly terminated will mean that the ECB will also reduce its post-Fed liquidity on a global scale.
"Thus, negative pricing may take place on behalf of the country's markets, which provide high current and compulsory access to foreign funds such as Turkey."
Erol Gürcan, Director of Investment Advisory, said that there was a rather serious rally in terms of global stock markets following Trump’s election as president in the US in November 2016.
Gürcan noted that the key element triggering this rally movement was possible to say that it was possible to say that it was possible to increase global growth expectations, including promises of tax cuts:
Borsa <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul was also at the top of the leading exchanges in the global rally.
While one of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained quite accountable compared to the developing country markets in recent years, it is also useful to say that the steps taken by policy makers to support the economy and financial markets have played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active as of March, has a serious effect on the rise seen so far in the index.
In the rest of the year, Gürcan stated that the positive developments reflected significantly in the prices and that the KGF, which plays an important role in this increase, was slowly reaching satisfaction, although the BIST 100 index is still in the same position as the BIST 100 index, which is still in the same position as the previous year.
In particular, the 180-day action plan, which has been expected to share details for some time, is expected to make adjustments in support of the company's profits, such as the increase of the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, and the development of potential tax cuts that will be on the agenda in the near term.
In the case of the Fed, the Fed, the Bank of England and the Central Bank of England (BoE), which is in the case of the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, the Fed and the Fed.
Gürcan, who says that the support zone of 104.150-104.600, which corresponds to the uptrend trend since the beginning of the year, is quite critical in the possible correction of the index in the next period, with 10.000 in the case of the breakdown of the support zone.
Gürcan said that if the current upward trend is maintained and the strength of the 108,605 with the current peak level is broken, the index could rise to the range of 110,000-112,000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO killed in military suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul attacked a military convoy, killed a NATO soldier, and wounded several.
In a NATO statement, he said five soldiers and one translator were injured.
Unconfirmed local sources say all three civilians were killed in the incident in the city's Karabakh region.
The bombing was the last violent act in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people were killed in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said Thursday evening that an attack was carried out on a joint patrol with the Afghan army with a "personally guided hand-made explosive."
The statement said all the injured were in good condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
Reporters say the Taliban’s growing power and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces, which are spoken near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1,662 civilians in the first half of 2017, an average of 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb in the mostly Shia region of Kabul killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban said the attack was carried out by them.
On May 31, after U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country.
The act of violence highlights the unstable security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump’s emphasis on whether or not to increase the number of U.S. troops assisting the country’s army and police.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA Refused to Delay Dirty Air Rule After Cases
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has returned from the decision to delay the law, which is an Obama-era law that requires states to block emissions that cause bad smoke, by suing the 15-state organization on the initiative a day later.
The EPA announced Wednesday that it was showing its determination to work with states late in the hour, saying it would continue with the 2015 Ozone Decisions.
EPA President Scott Pruitt said in a statement, “We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being sensitive to them.”
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s intention to delay ozone decisions by one year until October 2018, with these decisions measuring existing dirt smoke pollution in various parts of the country and deciding where the cut is required to meet more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the District of Columbia, along with 15 mostly Democratic states, filed a lawsuit that said the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration continues its quest to reclaim the broader range of environmental regulations implemented by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda Trump has called to revive economic growth.
But these efforts led to the reaction of conservative groups concerned about the effects of Democrats and more emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says that air inhalation containing ozone can “reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.”
The forest gave the good news...
Time for stops and wing transfers!
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> President Fikret Waldan told Bein Sports about the transfer of Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and stoper.
The Forest of Ideas said...
No surprises on the transfer.
Our goal is not too much transfer, it's point shooting.
Now we're going to do a stopter and wing transfer.
We have Champions League matches, hopefully we get a good score.
We have to make a wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don’t have a budget like that.
When it comes to budgets, we transfer, and we don't, we don't die.
I can't give you any information about the lens without clarification.
We are a public company.
The End of Patience is Peace.
Is there a threat of work only for the festival on August 30th?
Reactions to Ankara’s government banning all public events, including sit-ins, commemoration meetings and so on, including concerts, on the grounds of the “ISIS threat,” continue throughout August.
The government’s banning decision includes the expression “all collective events”, while Ankara’s 7th.
The International Grand Festival of Ankara is still going on.
In a statement to S<0xC3><0x96>ZCÜ, Chairman of the CHP Group and Ankara Representative Levent Gök, "There can be no impact on the 30 August bans," he said:
He's got a serious head turmoil.
The governor even hesitated about what decision he would take.
The task of the state is to create areas to celebrate the holidays.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir also said "All of Ankara has a security problem, only Gök<0xC3><0xA7>ek's organizations have no security problem."
Ankara's Independent MP Aylin Nazl<0xC4><0xB1>aka moved the ban to the Assembly.
Nazl<0xC4><0xB1>aka, suggesting the Prime Minister's request for a response, said, "Does this ban not clearly reveal the AKP's republic and Ataturk hostility? How do you plan to prevent the millions who will celebrate August 30 in the areas?"
"I learned from Edwina that I was deceived."
The case of divorce from Ibrahim Kutluay, Demet <0xC5><0x9E>ener, was in Ni<0xC5><0x9F>anta<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> with his lawyer Asl<0xC4><0xB1> Hatemi the day before.
<0xC5><0x9E>ener, who opened a spiritual compensation case for Edwina Sponza, who claimed to have broken her home, submitted photos of Sponza and Kutluay to the court as evidence.
The socially beautiful Sponza also said in a statement about <0xC5><0x9E>ener, saying, "Demet has illegally seized my private photos."
"I KNOW I WANTED YOU"
After this latest development, <0xC5><0x9E>ener, who met with his lawyer at Ni<0xC5><0x9F>anta<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> Delicatessen, came out of the field when he saw the journalists.
When recalled to Edwina Sponza’s photo claim, Shener laughed, saying, “God, I must have gotten into the house.”
In fact Hatemi de Sponza's complaint about "There is such a complaint but the content is not true."
“We have everything in our hands; we have presented it to the court,” he said.
<0xC5><0x9E>ener told reporters, "In the last period, everyone knew your wife's relationship with Sponza."
"How did you not know?" he was surprised at the question.
- What?
How's that?
"I swear I didn't know," said Shener, "would I believe my husband's eyes, or would I believe my mother-in-law's rumor?"
Before the reporters insisted, "Have you ever heard?", <0xC5><0x9E>ener said, "No," and went on to say, "I didn't hear it, of course I heard it the first time."
But in no way did I believe in such a thing.
Everything was normal, it was in place; there was nothing I could suspect.
Ma'am, when you sent it all to me, I found out it was all new, so...
<0xC5><0x9E>ener, who answered "Yes" to the question "Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?" slammed his head, claiming that the photos and correspondence he presented to the court had been sent by Sponza himself.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay had been assembled.

Qatar: We broke the embargo within hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar’s Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani expressed his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your respectable attitude and for the support you have given us."
I extend my greetings to President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an of Qatar.
The Qatari economy has proven its resistance.
In many countries, economies are negatively impacted, while our economy is stable.
We must work hard to ensure that Qatar is independent and strong.
We broke the embargo against us in a matter of hours thanks to Turkey.
We're not missing anything at the moment.
The natural resources we have provide a great deal of support to Qatar’s economy.
We were not affected by the brutality of the ablution against us and against the laws in Turkey.
Today, Qatar continues to produce natural gas and LNG all over the world.
“After the survivors, we saw a 30 percent increase in our natural gas exports, not a drop,” he said.
Al Thani, who noted that the fraternity relations between Qatar and Turkey and work in all areas is continuing, said, “The trade volume between us was $554 million in the first quarter.”
Decisions that have been made in recent times have played an important role in this.
As a result of Turkish products also prove themselves in the Qatar market, the acceleration of the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors is extremely important for us to make investments in many areas.
“I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us,” he said.
The cost of the latest disasters is 300 million TL
TSB President Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said that after the flood on July 18, the insurance companies received a damage notice of TL 116 million 7,000, in the earthquake of Gökova on July 21, 12 million lire 800 pieces of damage was received in the flood. In the floods of <0xC4><0xB0>zmir on July 27, and in the floods of <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul on July 16, the floods of <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul.
Ages, "In terms of helmet insurance, the damage caused by the full is capped per vehicle is <0xC2><0xA3>3,500, while the glass damage is around <0xC2><0xA3>1,000."
"In the earthquake, the average housing damage is 6,000 lira," he said.
Emphasizing that they are making an intense effort as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x81><0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F>lar said that 3 out of every 4 people do not have housing insurance, that one out of every 2 businesses does not have fire insurance, and that the risk is increased by 2 out of every 3 people who do not have helmet insurance.
Due to the low insurance rate in our country, the risk of facing serious damage costs to our citizens and institutions is increasing every day.
All of these costs should not be left to the government.
Insurance policies aren’t as expensive as they think, insurance isn’t just a sector that pays for damages; it also advises on risk management.
Increasing insurance awareness and insurance rates is very important for our people and our country.
Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>ag<0xC4><0xB1>r, "In general terms and conditions, the helmet insurance company writes that insured persons must report their damages within 5 working days and this period ended yesterday."
"Will he be an insured victim?" he replied, "Although under general conditions such a period of time in the Trade Act, the expiry period is 2 years."
“Also, these events are a natural disaster, so insureds don’t have to panic, I don’t pay any companies,” he said.
This is how the German media saw the huge auction!
At a time of increasing tensions between Turkey and Germany, the German company Siemens has won the victory over Turkey’s first Renewable Energy Source Areas (YEKA).
The German media announced the development, saying "German Siemens won the huge tender in Turkey."
DWelle Türk<0xC3><0xA7>e said in the news that the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon consortium has won the YEKA challenge, "The consortium will invest more than $1 billion in wind power."
"The auction, which opened for the creation of the capacity of two megawatts of wind energy, carries the feature of being Turkey's first YEKA auction" in the news that the number of companies competing in the auction has started today from 8 to 2, the Chinese Mingyang consortium and the German Siemens consortium.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, who made a statement after the announcement, made striking statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The auction was concluded with the victory of the German company Siemens and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and the world.
Looking also at Turkey and Germany’s 200-year historical cooperation, I believe that this outcome will make an important contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I have been very proud to announce that Turkey is at the forefront of this auction, and that the region and the world’s most reliable investment can be made.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, see a possible competition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia met for the first time on Thursday to cross paths to showcase the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for <0xC2><0xA3>147.
The Invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia was in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until they walked the corridor and greeted the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
On Saturday at Showtime, by unanimous vote, former four-cycle world champion Adrien Broner is among the top five members of the unattended list after Garcia's defeat.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN at 7 p.m. on Saturday night.
While the pair posed for the photos, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential rivalry between the fighters would be "excellent in size".
Garcia reminded me of "I'm an old feather chisel."
"I went up for the Broner (140 pounds) but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down on a light wave.
He also has to go through a light weight (135 pounds), so we can fight.
That's what the supporters want.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko joined.
"Hey, he needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether this should be in 'the past and the follow'; Garcia (37-0, 30 naqavt) set a date for the next summer and fight Lomachenko in a 135-pound opening match this year in the match against the Jo-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l
Garcia said, "The fight can be on the watch and on the watch because all the fans want it," and later stated that if the channel offers the best financial package, it is open.
We are the main names.
No other name would be of such interest.
Whenever they are ready..."
Garcia Lomachenko said she appreciated him as a "huge fighter" and could attend Saturday's meeting.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia with a plethora of pockets and said that Riverside thought the three-cycle champion looked "very slow," "sorry, Mikey... you asked for trouble."
Garcia said that the focus was boxing before showing the punching power.
They both said they felt my momentum was created for their own encounters.
“This is a fight that needs to be done.
Another fight doesn't create that much interest and rumor.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
Turkish remnants from Russia to America
The White House is not considering implementing sanctions that will affect Moscow’s pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of those lines.
This is due to the increased cost of borrowing.
Concerned about Western investment partners considering withdrawing from the projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin hastened the construction of pipelines in return.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which built the Turkish Stream line, which is planned to reach Turkey from under the Black Sea, accelerated the construction at the request of Gazprom.
Reuters reported that Gazprom has also begun the construction of a second pipeline parallel to Turkish Stream in order to be able to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's olitica age assessment test have been announced
The latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees who were subjected to a new medical age assessment method in Sweden ruled that more than 80 percent of those who took the test were over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden’s National Forensic and Drug Administration (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket)’s assessment of the age of some refugees who claim to be non-residents more accurate after criticism of their failures in assessing their correct age in the application process.
To date, the Migration Agency has submitted tests on 6880 cases, and the Department of Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals has announced the results of a total of 2,481 in the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (of the 2002 cases) were judged to be 18 or above, and in 25 cases, the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine ruled that the trial was "probably 18 or above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18".
The tests were performed only in cases where the person's age is suspicious.
According to Johan Göransson from the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine, the results are consistent with the past few months.
He told The Local, "We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past months, the figures are pretty consistent."
The high rate of cases judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the apartment announced the result of 581 tests and said that "there were 442 cases where the subjects were shown to be 18 years of age or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet looked at the results of 581 reported cases, she found that 243 clearly stated that she had reached the age of 18.
The method of medical age assessment, which includes x-raying of 20-year-old teeth and performing MRI scans of knee joints, and then analyzing them to dentists and radiologists, is criticised in some settings.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who assesses the biological maturity of people whose studies have entered the age of discovery earlier than normal or later.
“I have reasons to think about it, and I think that’s not the kind of measurement that should be used.
It is very doubtful to decide biological life in this way.
If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t do what we do,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, from the Department of Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals, defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult may be small.
The biggest risk is that the person is under the age of 18, which in this case is around 10 percent of the risk."
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Hamidiye Mosque opens for worship today
The Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Hamidiye Mosque, commissioned by Abdülhamit in 1885 by the architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened to worship on Friday after restoration work.
The Regional Director, Mürsel Yar<0xC4><0xB1>, said that restoration work, which began in June 2013, was completed and the mosque was ready for opening.
Yellow provided the following information: "Restoration work was carried out within 2 scopes."
The first part was the repair of the main building.
And the second part was the environmental regulation.
In the first part, about 16 million lire was spent on environmental regulation and about 11 million lire.
First, the bullets of the wooden dome were opened, after they were renovated, the external walls, the dirt from the external elements, were cleaned from the pastes.
Drainage was carried out for the consolidation.
There are very rich decorations, as you can see when we enter the window.
It's a piece with star motifs, and it's very rich in pencil work.
There's a karma style here.
"It is also evident that the traces of the Ottomans were made in the 1885s and the Baroque style began to be influential in architecture."
U.S. HUMANITY'S EMPLOYEES
"The German Emperor 2, in the middle of the chamber."
It had some flaws, was cleaned up and replaced.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages, which are symmetrical on both sides of the glass, we call greeting.
We know that these were made by our great founder, Abdülhamit Han, who built the mosque himself.
So we have the knowledge that he did it himself with his own hands and that he was installed here.
They're still standing here in their original form.
Yellow said President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was expected to attend the opening ceremony of the mosque.
Pantic claim in Göztepe
The Ukrainian press wrote that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer, unable to enter the squad in Dinoma Kiev, could be rented to a yellow-red club.
Pantic, who started in Serbia's Red Star team, wore the forms Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed with Dinamo Kiev during last season's circuit
West Virginia Governor Announces He Will Change Party
West Virginia’s Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday evening that he will change his party at a meeting with President Trump.
The governor said, "Whether you like it or not, the Democrats left me."
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
The meeting was suffocated.
Justice added, “So I’m going to change my record tomorrow as a Republican.”
“If I were a technical director, it’s time for you to set up a different game.”
Mr. Trump had promised to make an important announcement earlier at the West Virginia meeting.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
According to Forbes, with the coal business he inherited from his father, he owns coal mines in five states.
Its assets are about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Congress, meanwhile, released a statement on Thursday evening saying "The change of the party by the Republican Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which refuses to work to prevent it from making our country great again."
RNC women's spokesperson Ronna McDaniel told CBS, "With the control of only 15 governors and at least a few state legislatures in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the latest rejection of a party that is unleashed from the start and finds no positive, unifying message."
I will do my best for Turkey.
The third olympic record holder is Turkey.
He was born in Cuba, but Turkey, where he came for the F.Gar<0xC3><0xA7>e, recalled his own homeland.
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore a national uniform.
He was the first European champion, then the third Olympic...
Now it is one of Turkey’s most important medal hopes at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400-metre hurdles, spoke to SABAH before the championship started today.
They didn't want you because they didn't like their grades in Cuba when they were young.
You've upgraded your coach arrest.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some think you've chosen Turkey for your money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
From that moment on, I can say that I have drawn a line to what I've been through.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e club.
The National Team's initiative was made thanks to Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e.
They offered me an offer for supplementation.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of disabilities in my youth, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I signed important achievements in Rio and Amsterdam.
I look forward to doing my best at the World Athletics Championships and winning a different title.
You've had a press conference lately.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever a question is asked about Turkey’s ownership of me; I think of my childhood, I get kicked out of the Cuban National Team at the age of 23.
And, of course, people are coming to me in Turkey.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same when I was playing the Istiklal Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n.
I couldn't hold my tears.
I would also like to thank Turkey for the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I am very happy to be part of the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you could have a Turkish girlfriend before.
You're with a Turk now, you've gone to Cuba together.
Do you want to share what they're living?
The biggest increase in being with a Turk is tranquility.
Compared to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls are having a relationship with each other.
Your girlfriend is also an assistant coach at the same time.
Do you spend all day together, for example, feeding?
He eats more sweet than me.
(Both laughing) I don't actually have a very strict diet, but it gets mixed up with what I eat from time to time.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, often warns me against harsh diets, but I know that these are for my own good.
How does your lover cook you with Turkish food?
Turkish women cook very well, but my lover does better.
(Laughter) Dry beans are my first preference.
HE'S ONLY HIS WORLD
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
I had other young people in my place.
After winning medals on behalf of Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He looked me in the face and showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
I'm what I see, I'm who I am.
The curious thing about the glasses you wear in the races...
I'm just using it for concentration.
As soon as I put on my glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world, and I feel the wall on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
What’s the first thing that comes to mind when we call Tokyo 2020 HEYECANLI for TOKYO?
Felix Sanchez...
He won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics at the age of 35 when he was 400 metres behind bars.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at the age of 33, so why not?
TURKCELL SERVICES
Ismail Tutu, deputy general manager of Turkcell, said that they believed Yasmani Capello would succeed in London, saying, “We strongly believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in the best possible way in this championship as well.”
We wish all our athletes the best of luck to compete in London.
"We will continue to support the further development of Turkish athleticism and greater achievements in our country," he said.
Coe apologises for Russia’s ‘honest’ apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the head of global athleticism, praised Russia’s sincere apology for referring to the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be reinstated in sports.
Russia’s athletic boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress that it was true that his country was banned from sports at the end of the World Athletics Championships and that he was determined to fight doping.
"He apologised to all athletes who were forced to take gold and silver medals in competitions," he said.
Despite its own assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to enforce the ban after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-backed doping in Russia in November 2015.
IAAF President Coe told reporters, "I think today is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation."
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted itself, that it had passed the most tumultuous days, and that it had done everything possible to ensure that the federation was reconstructed..."
Coe said it was "me" because of Russia's acceptance of the re-acceptance criteria itself.
“I think it’s a very constructive day and I think it’s been taken, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force is not the right time to restore Russia’s rights,” he said.
“We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to separate clean athletes from the defective system.”
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF’s strict criteria will compete impartially at the World Athletics Championships, which will start Friday in London.
The head of the IAAF mission, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned trainers were still working freely.
Lie to U.S. 'YPG' tank news
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara has announced that no tanks have been given to any side fighting in Syria.
The allegations that hundreds of tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG have been denied.
In a statement issued by the embassy, the headline reads, “A statement about the false news in the press about the strings going to Syria.”
In a series of inaccurate news reports in the press in recent days, it has been falsely alleged that the United States has sent tanks and hundreds of barrels full of weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
This news is ignoring some of the basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The U.S. has not given tanks to any group fighting Deasha in Syria.
Much of the U.S. military aid primarily consisting of light weapons and ammunition supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The Syrian Arabs, who also cover the SAK, are fighting to clean up the De<0xC4><0x9F>a area and get back to their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment will be on top of last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said last year that 55 percent of all investment came after July.
Ermut, who reported that there was no reduction in investments due to the July 15 FET<0xC3><0x96> coup attempt, but on the contrary that the increase was, "Maybe there would have been more increase, it hit the cat."
Perhaps without these conditions, without some regional developments, we could see a further increase with the impact of the impact.
That’s why we look forward to more for next year.
Hopefully it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
Already with the first 5 months, we are going with an 11 percent increase compared to the first 5 months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there will be more," he said.
“We don’t have to worry about global or regional developments,” Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut, recalling that 75 percent of direct investment by 2010 was coming from Europe, went on to say:
That figure fell to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share rose from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, some problems arose among the Gulf countries themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries is saddening us and allowing investors to delay their decisions a little more.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, we may be experiencing some delays as a result.
Arda Ermut recalled that there were some events in Germany last week, but the government, in particular President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has clearly and unequivocally reacted to this situation.
When speaking to investors from the countries in which the most severe political crisis has occurred, President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s reaction is, “Look, the problems will be between governments, certainly not between peoples.”
Secondly, these people came and invested in my country.
This is no different from the Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the slightest problem, they will come to us, we will solve it.
"We will certainly not allow them to be victims," Ermut, who expressed his form, said that they continued to support all investors with the comfort of this.
Ermut said, “We can make sure of that in the next period.”
You will see that neither the German companies nor the investors from the countries where we are experiencing some problems in any way will be in trouble.
On the contrary, I hope that we will do our best to increase the investment from these countries.
We think that the investments coming from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions about the investment environment.
"But at this point, we will do our best to ensure that our investors and the perception of the investment environment are not affected," the assessment said.
TYDTA President Ermut said that after a one-generation one-way strategy, Turkey began to see great interest in China, but that if problems in the Gulf were solved, they would expect the largest investment from the Gulf.
"In relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says, 'We've been in trouble because of these relations, we've had investments because of this incident, we're running away'," Ermut said in a statement.
Ermut said: “Right now, about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are from German companies.”
So the companies we meet from all over the world, almost 10 percent of them are German companies.
Some of these are companies that are already investing in Turkey.
The man has a theme that will increase his investment, and we are open as a project.
“So German companies are in fact still an important part of our day-to-day workflow,” he said.
Ermut, who stressed that all state institutions should be careful at the time of the perceptive operations against Turkey, said the issue was sensitive and could be affected by at least some poor communication.
Ermut, pointing out that what happened in the last 2-3 weeks was a good lesson, said:
Investors and politicians have a different agenda.
We have always seen this; economic relations always make it possible for political developments to take a certain path.
Germany will continue to be an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because there are still a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany also increases these kinds of statements.
I think when they pass, they'll get a little bit better.
In Saudi Arabia’s case, the two countries are warning me not to make a negative statement.
As a result, an investor who invests in Turkey is investing by targeting the entire surrounding country’s markets.
So there have been some slowing processes, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region.
But we are still in talks with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are waiting for a decision that they can make faster at the moment.
“In a negative sense, I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I am leaving here,” he said.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who also meet with us while they are on vacation here, and we follow all their processes.
Recalling that last year's international direct investment (UDY) in Turkey was $12.3 billion, Ermut said: "I think we will definitely go through it this year.
"How far we will go, however, these regional developments will affect global uncertainties," he said.
While hoping that the impact would normally be more shocking, Ermut, stating that maybe it could be a little more limited, went by 11% in the first 5 months, pointing out that this could be preserved, "I hope it's not a bad development in the future."
Indicating that a significant part of the withdrawn investments will continue to be real estate, Ermut said that new investments could be seen in the fields of logistics, health, fintech, information, petro-chemical, food, energy and manufacturing.
Ermut also stressed that there will be new investments they will make in the coming months, "We may soon have an investment in terms of manufacturing."
It's not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
“There may be investments from interesting countries,” he said in his assessment.
4 wine companies in 9 operations: 55 arrests
<0xC4><0xB0>stanbul Smuggling Crimes Combating Smuggling Branch Teams, TAPDK bandrols sold on the products sold by 4 wine companies are not glued to the bottle by holding the long and loosely coated cover of the mushroom cover.
olis teams have suggested that the state lost 20 million 400,000 liras in tax due to repeated use of the suspects' bandrels.
Police teams organized the simultaneous operation today at 55 addresses between the four wine companies in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirda<0xC4><0x9F>, Bursa, Bal<0xC4><0xB1>kesir, Manisa, Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n, Denizli and Nev<0xC5><0x9F>ehir.
While a total of 55 people were arrested in the operation, 15 thousand ready-to-sell wines in the searches, 52 thousand 480 bottles of wine made with TAPDK hood many times used, 12 thousand 890 bottles of wine made with TAPDK hoods, 6 guns and bullets with TAPDK hoods.
Fifty-five people arrested were taken to the Department of Anti-Smuggling Crimes at Homeland Street.
Suspects are conducting security operations.
The operation carried out by their teams at their factories, warehouses and workplaces was reflected in the police cameras.
Police teams were shown to check the search in a warehouse by removing the hoods on the ready-to-sell bottles of wine.
A lot of bags collected from the used bottles were recorded by police teams inspecting the TAPDK hoods.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's going to Paris?
The rules to prevent unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring a world record from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris-Saint Germain.
From the prestigious Champions League tournament, which has the power to manage teams, the management unit that oversees the European game can come with all sorts of results from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
The Financial Fair Play rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that it would have to show that Neymar ultimately financed the transfer before PSG without suffering huge losses.
He paid Barcelona 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of the contract, and Neymar would rule out a salary that would find tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of Neymar’s financial aspects of going to France are:
Given the team’s money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG will be able to sign Neymar and of course pay the money to add it to the other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend loads of money to get players, but they also have to balance this with legitimate sources of income with a record of being able to cope with their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that in pursuit of his success, clubs incurring large debts were actively fraudulent and that he was at risk of bankruptcy if he withdrew his support from banks or owners.
In 2011, the FFP began to monitor its losses instead of focusing on the club's debts.
The change meant that the model Roman Abramovic first used at Chelsea in 2003 (take a club with potential, spend high on improving the team, and create a global brand) would turn into a more difficult endeavor.
During the 3-year FFP assessment period, which lasts until 2018, clubs could lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
Although Platini was disrespectfully removed from office in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, is still determined to give up without excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: “The FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen by pushing the rules forward.”
Although PSG will pay for Neymar’s purchase in bulk, it may extend the amount to the duration of the contract for accounting reasons.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP contracts in 2014 saw the heaviest contracts applied to Manchester City, which PSG and Abu Dhabi owned.
PSG was later fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million) down to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million and ordered to limit the Champions League team to normally 25 players instead of 21 players for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is in opposition to clubs that may try to trick financial regulators by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the club’s owners.
While a Qatari company may be a sponsor of PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is deemed to exceed the standard market values, UEFA will not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
In 2014, UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s PSG sponsorship had been inflated.
Some of Neymar’s earnings from PSG were reported to be coming through Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organizing committee payments.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will be World Cup ambassadors, and such a move can be easily brought to light by UEFA regulators.
Sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more careful against attempts to break the rules.
According to the founders on Tuesday, UEFA is not in a preventive interview with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of secrecy, as they were not authorized to speak about the PSG's situation.
The latest published accounts show that PSG earned more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Last year’s accounts have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gift and form sales.
The club expects the turnover to increase by at least 30 percent after being signed.
The Spanish league, which was clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the biggest players of the football, tried to prevent Neymar from leaving with the claim that PSG violated the FFP.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS that Qatar is the definitive owner of PSG, "This is an open case of 'money doping' with the club and the state."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports giant, shares concerns about the La Liga being funded by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday, "This is a result of having and has completely changed the whole floor of football over the last 15 years."
“Anything is possible once a country has a club.
It is very difficult to respect financial fair play because for a country such a large player representing a country can cause them to have different methods or different areas of interest.
Rebellion of the 'Ceiling Price' from Insurers
According to the TSB, the insurance industry has been damaging the traffic sector since 2006.
In 2015, the sector damaged 2.35 billion TL, and in 2016, it earned only 19 million TL in profit.
Borsa operates Aksigorta, Anatolian Insurance and Sun Insurance in Istanbul.
Speaking at the meeting in which the first six-month results of the TSB were evaluated in 2017, <0xC3><0x81><0xC4><0x9F>lar said that the 11-year damage to road insurance reached TL 7.3 billion, with the application of the ceiling premium, the amount of the sector's damage increased to TL 2.3 billion this year, an estimated 12 percent of damage-prim rate.
This year, which says that the 2015 figure will be captured, highlighting that the damage recorded in 2012 and 2015 also brings the profits of other branches, "This means that by financing the bad driver, we are also raising the price of the citizen's housing policy."
“75 percent of the sector is financed by our foreign and foreign partners, in a sense, by bad drivers,” he said.
Ages have gone on like this:
We don’t expect profits from traffic, but we can’t show that we’ve made any profits in the past 11 years.
"We also accept this, but we continue to hope that if we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, together with other police officers," he said.
When the damage to traffic took the profitability of other products as well, the Ages said that there were dramatic price increases in traffic insurance around 30 percent in 2012, almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the biggest damage in our history.
"Even in an environment where prices so high, at the end of 2016, our turnover in traffic was only 19 million TL," he said.
Saying that they are waiting for the free tariff to be passed next year, Ages said, "We will lower the price of a good driver in the free tariff and apply a high price to a bad driver."
"But the Treasury is looking at the general outlook, the last word on when it will be in the Treasury," he said.
The Treasury Department pointed out that the increase in mandatory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 has affected a broad cut in society, and it has been implementing the maximum premium (floor price) since April 12.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance policies were determined on the basis of the yearly groups determined on the basis of the statistics of accidents, according to each vehicle group and the traffic density.
On the other hand, as of July, the "Risk Insured Pool" application for high-frequency damages in traffic insurance or vehicle groups was implemented.
The premiums and damages related to the traffic insurance policies covered by the pool will be shared among the insurance companies.
These insurers will be identified by the Premium Treasury.
Ages, due to the application of ceiling premiums in traffic, premium production in the first 6 months of 2017 decreased by 11.5% compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number of polices rose by 4.9% to 8.6 million, when inflation was taken into account.
The Ages, which said that this year's traffic will again take profits from other industries, said, "With this ceiling prices, this damage cannot be sustained.
How much more damage can the industry do?”
The Ages, which say that the capital of all the companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, when only 2.3 billion TL of traffic is damaged, the capital of the sector will be exhausted in three years, "Why foreigners are looking for a good driver to finance a bad driver, why do I have thousands of shares in Turkish?"
"At this point, we're trying to tell Treasury about our problem," he said.
After these developments, on a question about whether foreigners have reached the point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector, Ages said, “They have not reached that point yet.”
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands it falls to an average of 6 policemen per person, while in Turkey it is 1.3.
“Turkey, therefore, is a place where it really needs to grow,” he continued:
So they didn't give up here.
However, while the company makes a reasonable profit every year, it uses all the profits to grow the company.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector in 2016 was TL 40.5 billion, while in the first half of this year it was TL 23.1 billion, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period.
Ages have predicted that the sector will not complete with 15% growth per year in total premium production.
Thousands of chronic patients receive social welfare benefits
The details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Combating Chronic Diseases", which began its work a while ago with the instruction of the Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, became clear.
In the first phase, 4,300 people with tuberculosis and SSPE will benefit from the social assistance program to be launched for the poor citizens and their families.
Patients will be provided with over two-thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The ministry will also make an additional payment to tuberculosis patients who have been identified by the relevant health unit who are unable to go to medical self-care, who have maintained their lives depending on the bed, or who need to improve their home living conditions.
Payments will be made through Social Assistance Cards, which will be provided through PTT.
Those who are unable to withdraw money for reasons such as geographic conditions, illness, disability will be paid at the door.
The program carries the feature of being a first in the world in many ways.
One of the 10 companies to invest in is still German
Arda Ermut, President of the Turkish Investment Support and Promotion Agency, said that German firms in Turkey are seen as Turkish firms and that the political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world.
"There is no investor in the relations with Germany who says 'we have been in trouble because of this situation'," Ermut said.
Ermut said, “About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are from German companies.”
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans make up an important part of our daily workflow," he said.
Ermut said that the partnership of the Abraaj Group with the logistics company Netlog was a good example of this.
Abraaj Group partner Omar Syed pointed to economic growth in Turkey, saying, “We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey.”
<0xC3><0x96>zer, on his way to becoming the last Ottoman
It was announced that the experienced footballer, who took two weeks to find the club, would sign an official contract with Osmanl<0xC4><0xB1>sport in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, the <0xC3><0x96>zer Hurmak<0xC3><0xAD>, who signed a contract with the green-black club for 4 hours at the end of the transfer, made a significant contribution to the team with 5 goals and 4 assists, while wearing the form in 29 leagues, 2 cup matches.
The management, which covered the way back to <0xC3><0x96>zer, agreed with Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday instead of this player.
The transfer of the century has taken place!
Barcelona has announced that Neymar is transferring to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of 222 million euros.
The transfer development, which the football public has been following with excitement in recent times, has come to the fore.
PSG has joined the star-name squad by paying the player 222 million euros to be released for the Catalan team for the Brazilian player.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in the history of football along with this bonus service.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar from the 1st Football League (Ligue 1).
According to the club's website, the 25-year-old Neymar, who is ranked as the world's most expensive footballer, will sign a contract with PSG for a fee of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million by June 30, 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar was delighted to wear the form in the French representative, stating, "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most struggling and ambitious teams."
My reason for joining my teammates by coming to this club is to get as many cups as our fans want."
PSG will pay Neymar <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million for each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France a fee of over 400 million euros.
The strike of the seafarers is over.
The <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Metropolitan Municipality’s company <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z A.<0xC5><0x9E>. and the Turkish-Business Trade Union (TDS) could not be agreed on a collective bargaining agreement.
On July 12, the workers of the trade union member IZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z went on strike.
The strike, which lasted about a month, ended at 3 p.m. today after the workers were sacked.
According to the signed collective bargaining agreement, 12 percent of the salary of the black staff within <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z will be paid.
With the exemption of Income Tax obtained after the registration of IZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z, which renews its fleet, the salaries increased by 25 per cent for personnel in the status of shipman by 5 per cent.
The IZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z General Directorate announced that the inland basin will continue at the normal rate, and that the Yass<0xC4><0xB1>caa tours will start on Tuesday, and Fo<0xC3><0xA7>a and Urla tours will start next weekend.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir, stating that they have blocked access with strikes lasting 23 days, said: "The people of Izmir will relax."
As a result of the strike, improvements were made to the rights of our workers working on land and at sea.
We are happy to leave the table.
On average, 28 percent of people working at sea and 20 percent on land will have a share.
We also had friends who worked at the minimum wage level.
We have also made significant improvements in their salaries.
Nostalgia Becomes Niche With "Icely Hot American Writing" and "Comrade Detective"
So for the bright days of the characters in the 80s, for the grunge period in the 90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter did the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for 2001, for the stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd, go on to do more than just that.
As a cultural product, this is both an embodyment of our era of permanent memorable Facebook.
But as a series, as if his time is running out.
The "First Day of Camp" was an unexpected success, and it wasn't just because of the absurd humor (in it, there was a story about the origins of a talking box plant voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.)
Focusing primarily on humor (playing a variety of middle-aged actors with abasan children) made it impossible to recapture the past part of the joke.
The parody of "Ten Years Later" now played by adults is less emotionally based and more random, including a monologue about the perverted follow-up film of the '90s, such as "The Hand That Screams."
At one point, the character mixes an Apple Powerbook with some single-row skates and “a lot of other things from 1991.”
Many of the stories are the same.
With a soft heart, Coop (Mr. Showalter) is a writer who has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
There’s also another crazy treacherous plan that Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter) has mixed up in now, assimilating by George H. W. Bush (a very well-seated imitation by Michael Ian Black).
As usual, the best part of the series is interlude.
It’s nice to see Mr. Rudd, who has always had six lip-sections in Matt Dillon’s “Singles,” who looks like Andy, the most popular child in the old school.
This series can be moments of random insanity (e.g. a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series) until I reach what I thought was the logical result of: "Illuminated Hot American Writing: Twenty Years Later" which is the final scene of the film's "Illuminated American Girlfriend."
Meanwhile, Amazon’s “Comrade Detective” refers to a different kind of nostalgia: “The Americans’ Cold War revival, the film “The Bomb of the Storm” and even “GLOW” with its iconography against the East, West struggle.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy directed by Rhys Thomas looks like a comedy found on TV: a 1980s Romanian police drama where two Bucharest police officers fought for the real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles are played by the wolf Gregor and the idealist Joseph, Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Street, and their English duo Channing Tatum (both the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But that's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice visual jokes (Americans spend time watching chess on TV while watching football)
A well-known voice artist cast, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloë Sevigny, is a good material for the "who knows who the voice is" play.
But “Comrade Detective” calls himself so much likened to the reality of a propaganda drama that (including a killer wearing the Reagan mask), he mostly plays exactly like him.
He doesn’t know how to pass six long episodes, and the comedy isn’t fast enough or often enough.
Gregor and Joseph were constantly visiting the American embassy, where two fat men, always eating a bunch of hamburgers, were always hungry wolves in the lobby, while the "Comrade Detective" could have carried out the propaganda hiccup better if shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist viewer that Western culture can turn anything into a series of defeats.
The Romanian creators are not wrong: we are doing this to our own close past and even to theirs.
FET<0xC3><0x96>'s father is female.
The British Government, as a result of fifty years of experience, has seen that our family is loyal and sacrificial.
The supreme authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has long been sincerely attached to the British Government and is in great service.
It is necessary for the British Government to behave wisely and cautiously about this offspring with its own hands, to thoroughly investigate and examine everything, and to make careful decisions.
While trying to understand the FET<0xC3><0x96>, the starting point is the organization of the Hashhasi, but an elusive difference that has been forgotten is that the FET<0xC3><0x96> is an organization that emerged in the imperialist period and acted with the colonial regimes.
The first thing to do in this case is to take the first step towards women.
In the English praise at the entrance, the person who described him as the 'son who was made by the British Government with his hands' is Mirza Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmet Kadi<0xC3><0xA2>n<0xC3><0xAE>, the founder of Femininity.
Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed, a small town in the Indian state of Pencap, reported that "on December 1, 1888, Allah ordered him to take refuge from his followers and form a separate congregation."
In 1891, Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed said that according to his revelations and inspirations, <0xC3><0x8E>s<0xC3><0xA2> b. Maryam died of a natural death like other nebulae, and that God himself sent him as the Messiah and Messiah that Christians and Muslims were waiting for.
It is the same as that which is expected of the Muslims, and that is Mirza Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed K<0xC3><0xA2>di<0xC3><0xA2>n<0xC3><0xAE>.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed, who wrote books in India, which came under British rule after the Sipahi uprising of 1857, defending Muslims against Hindus and Christians under oppression, was believed to have been founded in the aftermath of <0xC4><0xB0>l<0xC4><0xB1>s<0xC4><0xB1>m<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>m<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>, but with the support of the CIA in the aftermath of Der<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>m<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>.
Like Gülen, Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed’s favorite idea among the imperialists is that “jihad” is a struggle that Muslims make with their own souls and that if they can live their religion freely, imperialism does not have a dimension to fight.
Even if you remember, Gülen went one step further and praised even the Crusader attacks, which are still open in our history, in a vase last year: “It is not very dangerous for the Crusader to invade our country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once they're done, they're not related to your wife, your daughter.
They're not connected to the mabedin, they're unconnected Crusaders!
Thought that Mehdi and Christianity are united in themselves, the idea that their own community will be the savior of Islam, the similarity of these theses with FET<0xC3><0x96>, as the concept of jihad only means the struggle with fetish, is also a form of education and civil society in general.
The total number of women’s centres in the world, which is said to have exceeded 2 million, is the number of countries officially registered by the emergency relief organization Humanity First in 1869.
In addition, 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensers in 55 countries, 8 publications in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and around 16,000 mosques around the world.
Prof. Abdüsselam, the first Muslim scientist to receive the Nobel Prize, was the first Muslim actor to receive an Oscar, Sir Zaferullah Han, who chaired the United Nations Judiciary, and Mahershala Ali, who was also the first Muslim actor to receive an Oscar.
Let's note that last week's women's meeting with 30,000 people in England was also polished as a body show.
One of their slogans is “Love Everyone, Hate No One” and a brief glimpse of their dates is enough to understand that women actually mean “love your employers/colonists.”
It is possible to extend the starting point and motivations of such structures as the Hulusa, FET<0xC3><0x96> or Tahir-ul Kadri up to the Women, and all of these organizations are in fact able to provide a gateway to imperialism and to support society in order to serve colonialism.
The "Last Wish" came out of the cargo
Emily Pomeranz, 50, who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, expressed a longing for a mixed milkshake (milk drink) from a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of the restaurant named Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has been running the same restaurant for 47 years, put his drink in dry ice and sent it to a hospital 600 kilometers away, paying a fee of $123.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To date, Ahmet Kul <0xC4><0xB0>n<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>at, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has launched Solse 7 projects in Dia Mare in Istanbul, and in Bodrum Yalikavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by the <0xC3><0x87>amo<0xC4><0x9F>lu Architecture, was developed to get the maximum benefit from the sea.
Located on an area of 11,000 square meters, Dia Mare has a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The project, which is completely finished with the rough structure, will begin to be delivered to its new owners in March 2018.
Dia Mare has many types of apartments ranging from 2<0x2B>1 to 5<0x2B>1.
The company, which will launch two more new plants in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkap<0xC4><0xB1> in 2018.
Transfer of $753 million to joint ventures
Peace Comrade said many programs were banned at TRT, with 6,760 staff, and expensive prices were paid.
CHP’s deputy, “TRT 2016” once again attracted the nation’s taxes to AKP companies.”
"It's called robbery," he said.
The source transferred by TRT to co-production companies was revealed by data obtained from official documents.
CHP <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul MEP Pa<0xC5><0x9F> Yarka<0xC5><0x9F>’s official response to the application made under the Law on Information Acquisition of Comrade of Istanbul looked at how TRT’s resources were spent.
The comrade said that in the TRT, where 6,760 people work as staff, despite all kinds of technical possibilities, 753,500 million TL was transferred to partner companies in 2016 through the programs implemented under the name of external production.
The CHP's deputy used the phrase, "It's underlined."
Peace Comrade, "The AKP's journalists and businessmen's production companies are smothering TRT."
"Millions are being paid for unwatched or unchecked productions," he said.
Recalling that the money transferred to companies was collected from public taxes, "the institution with 7,000 staff has returned to the arbitrariness of the AKP."
“What programs did these companies sign up for that 7,000 people couldn’t do and took that money?” he said.
TRT’s 2016 advertising revenue was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>224,456,182, according to the Associates, staff salaries and other expenses accounted for, but the advertising revenue remained huge.
"The TRT, which became the voice of the AKP, can't advertise because it's not being watched."
Feeding journalists are getting money from TRT, swindling on behalf of the AKP.
He said, “The people are pulling the load.”
Comrades from CHP continued: “TRT pays TL 660 million a year to staff, but it gives all the work to external productions.”
From TRT, 753.5 trillion compatriots have been pulled from the public's pocket.
It's resplendent.
She gave up her suicide, kneeling in front of her husband, apologizing.
The incident took place this afternoon at a car park in D<0xC4><0xB1>rmen Sokak in Eyupoglu District.
According to the information obtained, the residents of the surrounding area who saw a citizen swarming down from the 4th floor of the parking lot reported the condition to the fire and health teams.
While the fire crews were opening firefighters in the area where the person was present, the health teams were also waiting for them.
A psychologist and police team called to the scene after almost an hour of convincing efforts to stop suicide, the 34-year-old father of the child, Jonas G., apologised in front of his wife, N.G., who was watching him in tears.
On the other hand, while watching about 100 people sitting on the street where Jonah G. was attempting suicide, some citizens recorded with their cell phones.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after slow economic growth and accelerating inflation has been reduced.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be “slow” due to the tightening of family incomes, as they kept their interest rates steady.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision-makers used 2% of the vote to keep interest rates at 0.25%, so they asked for less members this month after weakening support for slower economic growth.
In its three-month inflation report, the bank drew growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household incomes will continue to shrink as inflation is expected to rise to close to 3% in the spring.
However, interest rate hikes signalled that it is necessary to stabilize inflation blinded by Brexit over the next few years, and said borrowing costs could remain higher than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the massive economic recovery package, which was launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank said it would end its International Funding Plan, which offers banks cheap financing starting next February, but expects to offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under the plan (a total of <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion).
Minutes after the interest rate decision was taken, the bank said: “The central estimate of the MPC is that, in the short term, the shrinking of domestic real incomes continues to be a burden on consumption by the gross domestic product (GDP).
In terms of interest rates, he stressed that “a bit of shrinkage in monetary policy” may be necessary to alleviate inflation and that the market will be “a bit higher” than expected.
Markets are still forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank emphasizes that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to the May forecasts, the bank’s declining growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared at 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank maintains its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The sterling lost value to the dollar and the euro after the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after GDP slowed down its growing growth expectations by the latest growth figures, which were disappointing at 0.3% in the previous three months, compared to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but it will begin to show a slight increase towards the end of the year according to the bank.
While the bank says the tightening will worsen even before it recovers, the latest inflation report leaves little to rejoice for households hit by rising inflation and low wage increases.
The bank said monetary policy could not “impede the impact of revenues over the next few years,” but it expects a “significant improvement” towards the end of its three-year salary forecast.
As a result of the weak pound, the increase in demand for British goods will support the economy by balancing some of its declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock of the pound-down vote on the EU referendum last August reduced interest rates to 0.25 percent.
The bank predicts that it will likely take four years for this to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s latest interest rate decision, there was a demand for an increase in inflationary pressure on hard-pressed households and an increase of 0.5% by the three policymakers in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 per cent last month in July to 2.6 per cent, but the bank said it was expected to do so and will increase once again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess is "completely" related to the powerless pound, according to its 2% target.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent declines in earnings rates, while lenders are demanding to do business and close the year in a positive way, the mortgage market will once again become more competitive.
The market looks good for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts in remortgages, with many free options and low interest rates becoming more popular than ever.”
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the High Court, following a struggle over the funding of the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to reach the 'converting' HIV prevention treatment from September.
The NHS in the UK has shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by 86%, a pre-exposure pill (PrEP) prophylaxis will be provided to an estimated 10,000 people by health services through a 3-year pre-exposure trial.
The High Court's decision last year agreed to fund the experiment following the approval of the Temyiz Court. The decision said that despite the NHS's claims to fund local authorities, it had the power to pay for PrEP.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS UK President Simon Stevens as a “new and serious intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a “turning point.”
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered clinics, with more clinics being fully implemented across the UK by April 2018 with the participation of October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough of the drugs to prevent HIV infection from occurring in the body.
Such medications can be taken every day or until almost two hours before having sex.
Those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV-positive partners who cannot be successfully treated.
Clinics will identify appropriate participants from men, women, transgender individuals, and people who are not known to have HIV cases controlled by an antiretroviral treatment.
Individuals who live in the UK and are registered with a practitioner may also be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS has signed an agreement this week to provide the drugs with a bid to the UK nations.
The trial was designed to evaluate the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, conducted and applied on a large scale.
Mr. Stevens said: “This new and serious intervention will contribute to a wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in the thirty-year development of undermining one of humanity’s major health problems.”
Deborah Gold, president of the National Aids Trust, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If the right target is targeted to those who are in need and at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of converting the HIV virus into the UK.
Starting in September, people at high HIV risk, through this experiment funded by the NHS in the UK, will reach a truly personalized and non-negotiable new and powerful vehicle that will lead to many lives to improve.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Terrence Higgins Trust Chairman Ian Green said: “The first thing to do right now is to ensure that the experiment is delivered quickly across the country and that no one who is at risk of HIV is left behind.
With the PrEP experimental drug now being provided, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We welcome the beginning of the PrEP experiment and the months of delays and then the government’s resignation.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be in ending the infection as part of our view of preventing HIV and how life-changing it can be.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this experiment is presented as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in the community.

Two Secret Deaths
Former Minister of Industry and Commerce Ayhan <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu's daughter <0xC3><0x9A>mit Makbule <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu (51), who was born in Washington, lost her life by falling from the 19th floor of a business center used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu, a 24-year-old student from Ko<0xC3><0xA7> University, was also found dead at his home.
Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu's asthma was advanced.
The investigation into two secret deaths that followed and were deemed suicide by the police was initiated.
"Depressive Ward"
<0xC3><0x9A>mit Makbule <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, daughter of Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Commerce Ayhan <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who was born in Washington in 1971, entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1 at 17.00.
On the 19th floor, an ambulance and a police team were called at the scene to inform the hotel management of a Kuwaiti tourist who saw the inanimate body of <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who had not been informed for a while.
The health team determined that <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who fell to the hard ground from the 19th floor, lost his life.
The mother, Mediha <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who told the police, "There has been a depressive situation recently."
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31st.
I have a grandson with leukemia from my other daughter.
"He was taking care of my grandson and was adversely affected by my grandson's illness," he said.
The <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who was transferred to the Forensic Medicine Agency, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
We're investigating whether the Chilingirogulu was thrown by someone or committed suicide.
EDITION OF 'CANINA KIIDI'
Another suspicious death in Istanbul occurred in Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer Zakeriyaköy.
Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu (24), who studied at Ko<0xC3><0xA7> University, was found dead.
According to the allegations, the young girl's father went to her daughter's home near the point of school where she did not receive any news and could not be reached from her cell phone.
Dad encountered the dead body of his daughter at home.
It has been rumored that Melis, loved by her family, close circles and friends, has ended her life by setting herself up at home.
The death of Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu drowned the family and loved ones.
After Melis, a friend of mine said on social media, “A bright sun was hitting our face.”
The green grass beneath our feet was our pleasure as we ran after that little plastic ball with your best friend Jack and your sister Eishan.
He shared his message, "What it took to die now."
Living a luxury life: Hanging floors and smart design numbers have turned this tiny Earls Courts apartment into a fresh home.
In 2014, Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate renovation, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court.
This is evidence of a new design in the first floor of a Queen Anne-style scanner and which convinced Joanne to collect her suitcases.
“I used to live in a much bigger area with my ex-girlfriend in Knightsbridge,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something at my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day.”
After the first visit, the 1000-square-foot apartment was renovated from scratch.
Initially it was a one-room and complex planned property; you had to move from the kitchen to reach the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a hanging floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
That was my condition,” he said.
To this end, Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio Duck & Shed took Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5-foot ceiling and create a place for Joanne to live in, not just a building.
The ceiling wasn’t high enough to add two areas to the top, so the architectural difficulty was to create a suspended floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex," he explains.
“We had to adjust the gaps so that they could be stacked up against each other without the need to bend down.
It wasn’t just to build a simple platform, it was also to bend the steels so that they would be at the right height depending on the top or bottom function.”
This arrangement also brought many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to get two full-sized rooms on top of each other.
The old type of copper light window taken from Retrouvius for hanging floor overlooks the magnificent living area below.
The mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and old-style Serge Mouille lighting all define the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
The mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirrored protective panel in the kitchen gives the feeling of a window opening into another room.
The mirrored units in the train provide Joanne's entire razor blade set and storage space.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more magnificent perception of space, is to be able to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
Closed kitchens are not new.
What’s unique about this is that it has a garage-style removable door.
Erfan explains the steel-reinforced polished MDF door, “We used some engineering on it.”
"It has a balance weight so it slides really easily when you push the door up."
With the intelligent use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved seating plan.
“At the end of the day, you are going to sell the seating area, or the value of your property is determined,” says Erfan.
"As a peptide, a realtor will enter and make a calculation based on the seating area."
Here, they were able to use quality materials that gave the area a luxurious look while increasing the floor area.
Erfan says, “Materials are the objects you touch, and so it helps you to establish an emotional bond at home.”
"At home, you won't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don’t shake the cords of your heart.”
This is proof that a good design and an enlarged square footage can turn an apartment from something standard to something quite magnificent.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
At the end of the 1.5-month interview, he transferred to Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> with the Lens bonus service, initially thought to be leased.
After a week of intensifying talks, Lens agreed with the Black and White team in return for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million bonus service fee.
The Dutch player, who signed a five-year deal, will receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 million a year.
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> is expected to make an official announcement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.

The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony with a photo of what they called "the most special moment of our lives."
After seven years, the couple decided to separate.
The brothers are fighting for a $500 million estate empire.
Two brothers, forty years after the dynasty established by Italian families, are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave himself to the High Court on how to share the properties and business assets in a property in Toorak.
Paul had wanted to quit his family business since 2014, but there was a tough debate in the High Court over the split.
Together with their mothers Anna, their brothers and sisters, Smith Street, have owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since they bought a store in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and expanded it into a chain with 160 retail outlets.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money property was invested and De Lutis’ portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento tenement grounds, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
Under an agreement with his deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as "a significant driving force and a dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns one-third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns $316 million and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
Sharing property and nudity for Paul appears to be a contentious issue.
In 2015, he wrote in his first sworn statement to the court: "The shares proposed by Colin left him with the properties I've always added as the best."
The first Supreme Court trial was held on Friday after a number of failed arbitral proceedings.
The brothers are also in a fight over who will control the existing job; Paul claims that Colin has left him out of the job.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent managing some of his estates.
Colin, in a sworn statement at the outset, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements recorded by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and e-mails from top lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisers held by both sides are on the rise.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were an Italian immigrant family who operated groceries and appliances from the late 1950s and had bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Colin had taken his property hostage to buy the Collingwood property, where his family opened the first jeans store.
Colin says he's set up Westco there "in my last few years, when Paul was a little kid (10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their property to their sons in a friendly way.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court," he wrote.
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colin says he paid Mark $10 million when he quit the job, and Luke $26 million when he left the job.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark "were dissatisfied with the terms of their financial divides."
According to the 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, the best friend of the television star, Colin tried not to draw attention despite being a former member of the board of directors of an AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin simply responded by saying, "I can't say much because he's in court with a short message."
"It was very sad that my brother Paul preferred to sue me and dragged our family's name to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote that he was trying to fulfill his brother’s demands in a court of law.
"Our father, Paul and I didn't want us to get into the existing dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution."
On Friday, that hope seems to be gone.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future."
Trump’s new private pen plans to restrict the president’s media diet.
Others tried and failed, too.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If it does, it'll be the first.
Politico says the new White House special pen will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports) in hopes of keeping his boss more stable.
Here's a little bit of information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the White House’s new private pencil, John F. Kelly, met with senior staff on the first day of work, President Donald Trump summarized a fundamental problem that he planned to solve with regard to the White House: the passing of bad information into the president’s hands.
Kelly told staff, whether on paper or with briefings, that the information should flow through him, because the president would be able to make better decisions when well informed.
Kelly’s diagnosis sounds very meaningful, but others have tried to embody Trump by overseeing his media diet and have failed.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades and he is now in the White House, watching TV is still in good shape.
Former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February, "It would be amusing to show that if candidate Trump did not appear fairly in the media, I would show him that he found a fair place in convincing media organizations."
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, “According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption included a steady stream of praise.”
Okay. Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit is “under control” at any time is ridiculous.
Perhaps the campaign officials know something that the rest of us don’t know, for example, Trump’s tweets would be much more provocative without their own intervention.
We’ll probably never know anything about tweets that Trump hasn’t sent.
If his men were able to put him out of harm's way a few times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating a debate.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of rivals, that is, in any case, people who were trying to advance their agents with the materials they offered to Trump (they could be reliable or unreliable) and who promoted their views of the world.
In May, throughout this story, Politico reported the tendency of advisers to strategically convey dubious information to the president.
An example that reporter Shane Goldmacher described in detail was as follows:
"Existing and former Trump officials say that Trump has taken the press to negative coups, especially the leaks that have a negative impact, and to find out where they come from.
At the end of February, one of the presidents, Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson’s website GotNews.com, confiscated a printed copy of an article accusing private pen assistant Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a series of leaks” at the White House.
It didn’t matter that Johnson was banned from Twitter on the basis of harassment, or that he didn’t provide any concrete evidence, or that he had made accusations in the past and turned away from them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff questions about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the then private pen Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter were “trying to put in place a system that manages and documents the documents Trump received.”
How did that work out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his impulsive state and his aides are still competing for penetration.
These immutable factors will make Kelly's job quite difficult.
Krypto FET<0xC3><0x96>'s revealed with a special template
Prosecutor of the Republic of Izmir Berkant Karakaya, in the context of the investigation into the leakage of some information in the "military espionage investigation" was conducted. The secret witness, codenamed "Sarma<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>" was launched.
The review emphasized that, unlike the non-organizational manoeuvre of the Admiral Flyer, it assists the investigating agency in the decryption of crypto organization members under the command of the Navy and plays an active role in the fight against FET<0xC3><0x96>.
In the decision indicated that the ship was attempting to be pacified by order of the Commander of the Navy under the so-called tightening order of the coup attempt on 15 July, the ship received an effective fight against the FET<0xC3><0x96> from the first day of the coup attempt.
The following expressions were used in the follow-up decision given by Karakaya: "Crypto Marine Corps personnel created on 209 sub-criteria by means of a special template for the detection of FET<0xC3><0x96> members belonging to the class of crypto private services and by 64 basic criteria."
It is known that a special and persistent effort has been observed in the legal investigations, and that there is no evidence, except for the facific and unfounded statement of the secret witness, in which there is no evidence of the name, as well as the fact that it is an active counter-terrorism organization, and its contribution in this direction is known to be counter-terrorism.
All-Admiral Yayci was convicted of insulting him before.
It also turned out that there were FET<0xC3><0x96>s and that the alleged crime was a hoax.
Former Air Pilot Colonel Hakan Din<0xC3><0xA7>, found in the plaintiff's complaint that offended him, translated the complaint into a document only in the form of a note of information.

It turned out that some of the members of the organization Tuncay Op<0xC3><0xA7>in, which is a FET<0xC3><0x96> party, were targeting Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> with their social media posts before and after the coup attempt on July 15.
Travellers crossed the ditch, returned to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the richest homeowners of the West Midlands are in a re-fight with busy travelers who have been excavated by the council to retrieve the area outside of their mansions.
Passengers parked their 20 caravans outside an area that is called Solihull's street at the time and is referred to as the 'Neighborhood of the Rich'.
The council, after being fired in May, did not come back from the ditch it dug to cut its currents, bringing babies and a full truck.
The intelligently moving group found a gap in the defense, leaking their vehicles from a section that had been left unblocked.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council by saying it was "useless in solving the problem".
An unnamed resident said: “They came there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath to stone throwers on the way.
We should be ashamed of the Council’s actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The passengers were there in May, they were sent, and now they are back.
“There was more last night, and there will probably be more today.”
He added: “Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with the long-distance decisions taken to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I’m not happy to continue paying my taxes when the council can’t even stop it.”
A local resident who did not want to give his name, said: “As a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers had just left, that we were almost destroyed by a new group.
The numbers increased this time, and it was seen that a horse was grazing in the parking lot.”
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: “We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on the grounds of Straetsbrook Street, and we are initiating the necessary legal procedures to send them from there as soon as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is vital that as many local residents as possible call 101 to report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help in the emergence of a picture of the case so that the court can consider when we bring our case to the court."

Last day's call!
They've flown to the fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged in the storm and flooded in Istanbul last Thursday.
While most of the drivers reporting from the fire to be covered by the damages by insurance companies, drivers who have not yet received a report have also entered the queue for the report.
Drivers who have not been notified today have come to the fire stations to request a report due to the fact that this period is the last day of the notification.
Today is the last day
Drivers first took photographs of their vehicles to firefighters to detect damage to their vehicles.
Drivers who detected damage to their vehicles then reported to officials.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I recorded it and I'm going to take a picture."
There was intensity when I came.
"There was damage to the front window," he said.
The driver, Erbil Sword, said, "We're on the run."
We're in line.
We took the photo.
“We’ll wait for the report,” he said.
Skyscrapers with sea and land walls don't breathe
Radir Ataman, a member of the CHP’s Assembly, noted in an earthquake warning about the rising giant structures on the coast: “The report of experts in the court clearly says that these structures will not withstand the earthquake at 6 magnitude.”
It is stated that the pillars where the solid rock is 25-30 meters below are not so deep excavated.
The high-rise hotel and residences on the Atakoy beach between the sea and the land left the district breathless.
Radir Ataman, a member of the Assembly of the Municipality of Bak<0xC4><0xB1>rköy, CHP, has reacted to the huge AVM, hotel and residence projects that have risen one after another in the district.
Ataman, noting that the structures on the coast were winding down, said: “80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind had created the Atatürk Forest for Florya.
80 years later, whatever the point of urbanism was reached, giant skyscrapers climbed the windmills and changed the climate.
He said, "There's no breathing at all."
Ataman, who stated that buildings rising like walls on the beach of Ataköy changed the balance of the climate, continued: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the thunderstorms."
These buildings need to be made according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures disrupt the natural balance of life.
Ataman pointed out that these skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, also cut off the connection of the people of the island with the sea, and said they would appeal to the Board of Monuments on the subject and go to justice.
Treatment without surgery is possible in the case of hair loss.
In cases where phenol is applied, 83% of success is seen.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent that kills the hair roots.
One of the treatment techniques for non-surgical hair loss is the laser method.
With various lasers, the hair roots and the surrounding tissue are burned by circular scattering rays, and during this combustion the tissues are allowed to close by sticking together.
Thanks to these two non-surgical methods of hair loss, patients can return to their social and business lives in a shorter time.
Dr. Mert Atak, who points out that excessive weight, motionless life, long-term sitting at work, causing hair loss and non-compliance with the rules of hygiene, causes hair loss, pain in the tail among the symptoms of the disease, infection, abscess and bloating.
Italy hardens STK’s approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy warned the STKs operating a migrant rescue boat in the Mediterranean would not be allowed to continue if they did not comply with the new rules affecting their operations.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Turin newspaper La Stampa, “It will be difficult to see if the STKs do not comply with the new norm, if they continue to operate.”
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat operated by the German aid agency Jugend Rettet with the suspicion that its crew was actively cooperating with human smugglers to facilitate illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has only been active for a year, has refused to comment on the content of detailed allegations directed against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, the organization said: “Saving human life is and will be our top priority for us, so we’re very sorry we’re not going to be working in the search and rescue zone right now.”
"But we can only do an assessment of the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and have been able to assess the situation."
Italian officials have been monitoring Juventa, the boat of Jugend Rettet, since October.
It is suspected that the crew took migrants to the boat, packed with rubber boots delivered directly by human smugglers, and allowed smugglers to flee for re-use by boats.
According to the Italian media, at least one such meeting took place in the 1.3-mile stretch of Libyan coastline, according to the prosecutor's files.
The crew is under suspicion of not counting the authority of Italian coastal security, which has led to rescue operations in the region due to a very humane effort for any other purpose.
According to the law, the deck of boats like Iuventa was clearly supposed to have an Italian police officer overseeing their activities.
Only three of the nine STKs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the truce so far: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The last of these, he said on Tuesday, considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because it would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" in its own rescue operations.
Those who refuse to sign include the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp drop in the number of migrants coming to Italy following rescues in recent weeks was an indication of Libya’s efforts to strengthen coastal security and cooperation with local governors bearing fruit.
The minister said: "In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, the Libyan governors announced plans to hold further talks on economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left Chad, Niger and Mali in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, Russia’s capital, Carpus won vodka as it did every year in celebrations of the “Day of paratroopers’ troops”.
Nikita Razvozjayev, a Russian NTV reporter, who took part in the event and ran a lot of alcohol, was attacked by a Russian NTV broadcaster at Gorki Park.
The reporter, who recounts the developments of the day in a live broadcast, immediately blatantly and blatantly warned the man, "We will seize Ukraine."
The drunk man, who was reported to be an old paratrooper, punched him hard on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, who struck him with a blow, tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the shock moment live.
The Economic Coordination Board was convened
The Economic Coordination Council (ECC) met under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Shimsek, responsible for the economy.
After the cabinet change in the government, the first EKK meeting, chaired by Shimsek, began at 6.30 p.m. in <0xC3><0x87>ankaya Kö<0xC5><0x9F>kü.
The meeting will discuss Turkey’s macroeconomic outlook.
At the meeting chaired by <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek, Finance Minister Naci A<0xC4><0x9F>bal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk <0xC3><0x96>zlü, Minister of Employment and Social Security Jülide Sar<0xC4><0xB1>ero<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Minister of Customs and Trade, Bulent Tüfenk<0xC4><0xB1>r <0xC3><0x87>eman<0xC4><0xB1> Mer.
It is possible to get rid of sneezing in 45 minutes
Dr. O<0xC4><0x9F>uz Karaemino<0xC4><0x9F>ul<0xC4><0xB1>li says, "The first step is rest and drug treatment according to the results of the examination and imaging of the patient.
O<0xC4><0x9F>uz Karaemino<0xC4><0x9F>ul<0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>, who stated that in the patient group where the pain persists, experimental methods (e.g. epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, intra-disc attempts) should be tested, "If it is not possible to achieve success in all of these methods, if it becomes difficult to cope with it, and if it is not possible to achieve success in the legs.
Karaeminogues, saying that the ‘full enclosed spinal cord surgery’ that minimizes the risk today also allows patients, who are not able to achieve results by means of entrepreneurial methods, to reduce their constraints on surgery, it is possible to get rid of spinal cord disease in 45 minutes.
Although relatively good results are obtained with open surgery with microscopic surgery, some complications such as long recovery period after surgery, adhesions to the spine, recurrence of fever, and future abdominal slippage and infection may be encountered.
Microscopic surgery is often referred to as ‘closed surgery’, but microscopic surgery is also applied in the same way as open surgery.
With full-closed spinal cord surgery, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissues are protected.
Full-closed spinal cord surgery only takes 45 minutes.
the Special Commission 's
CHP MPs Mehmet Gökda<0xC4><0x9F>, Cemal Okan Yükssel, Peace Fellow and Member of the Higher Discipline Council Turan Aydo<0xC4><0x9F>an will participate in the commission.
The Commission, Berbero<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s on October 4, <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul 14.
He will also follow up with his trial in the High Court of Criminal Justice on appeals to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeals.
The CHP Secretary General is Kamil Okaya S<0xC4><0xB1>n and in his letter of assignment, the Deputy President of the Republic, Bülent Tezcan, said, "The independence and impartiality of the court is an indispensable condition of justice, not taking orders from anywhere other than the law."
"Our representative, Mr. Enis Berbero<0xC4><0x9F>lu, has not requested any special status while performing his duties as a representative, has not resorted to the intangible armour of his nationality, and has sought to preserve his belief in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary," it said.
It was suggested that the trial process preferred the execution of political orders rather than the court's execution.
In the letter, it was argued that, despite the Constitutional Court's incorrect decisions to arrest MPs, the decision to arrest without finalization was given, there is clear evidence that the court has decided under the influence.
Michelle Carter has been fined for messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will face a 15-month sentence behind bars and a five-year legal evacuation.
In June, Carter was convicted of murdering Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to be cleared for his resignation.
Although Azami was facing a 20-year sentence, his legal team argued that both he and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, had aged eyes, narrowed hands, and stared at the ground as he was beaten to the penalty.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy."
He ended his life in order to heal his own.
He did not take responsibility.”
"He didn't show any regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation that he totally regretted."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not see "any significant effect on the actions of age, level of maturity, or even mental illness."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr. Roy's mother Lynn Roy: "There is not a day I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I have done everything, and I am trying to be with his sisters with all the sorrow that we will endure forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, expressed the fact that her brother would never attend the wedding or that his children would never be able to "get out of their minds."
“It’s a pain that you’ve been with every day since I was born that you’ve been gone for the rest of my life,” he said.
Looks like he's gonna sue because there's no law in Massachusetts that counts telling a person to commit suicide.
Mr. Roy was 17 when he was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case was of national interest when it was revealed that Carter's short messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While on vacation with her family, she said in many messages she sent two weeks before her death: "There are a lot of ways to get yourself out of a building, jump out of a building, with a knife, I don't know."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You should do this, Conrad," and "All you have to do is open the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz, instructing him not to be allowed to leave the case by the press, said Carter wanted to be interested in Mr. Roy's death.
The case divided legal views.
Amanda Knox was found guilty of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, two years before she was among the minority who defended Carter.
Ms. Knox, 30, wrote in an interview with the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment."
Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek's stunning growth forecast
In his statement, <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek said that inflation in Turkey should fall to low single-digit figures, and stressed that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts that inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his light speech, he said:
The next 12 months are critical in reducing uncertainties.
The biggest incentive is the reduction of uncertainties.
We have a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope that the uncertainties in our nearby geography will also decrease.
With some reforms, I believe that by increasing our resistance to shocks, we will put Turkey in a growth trend of over 5 percent.
I told you months ago.
The worst part is that it's left behind.
Gradually, the reforms that will bring our energy to those areas, not to those areas, but to the inclusive growth of our energy, to the increase of employment...
This is critical for the next 12 months.
On the one hand, the reform, on the other hand, where uncertainty is reduced, there is no political uncertainty already.
Hopefully our chances will go away and the trouble in our nearby geography will be reduced.
Even if we don’t want to, many of our classic markets have collapsed.
Libya, like Iraq.
We’re not just losing on Sundays, we’re facing more than 3.5 million migratory waves.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have solid problems on our foundations.
Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with some reform, we will again sit on Turkey’s growth policy of over 5 per cent, further increasing the question marks on the heads of investors.
To be clear, I'm from here, we have such a generous pension system.
I think it would be reasonable to say that our retirement companies aren't working hard enough.
Once the car participates, the performance will be strong.
- Why?
Because we've taken precautions.
Companies don’t have to go out and spend money.
Considering these concerns, given that performance is weak, we have made a mockery of how we will allocate global assets to which investment areas.
You know, the yields are high.
Once clearly, there will be a performance there in addition to the 25 percent that the state gives.
In addition, the rest is low on the treasury papers, and there is usually a low risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think your interest will increase in the next period.
Because they'll see the performance.
It is not a failure, it is a success.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, 70 billion lire accumulation.
The system has been successful.
There are 2.6 million participants in automatic participation and 775 million lire in accumulation.
We want more effort from the companies.
Let them do some advertising, let them tell this system.
We're working during the cayma.
Maybe if we can get him a little...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens see the yield and see the accumulation and stay in the system.
38 percent out of the system.
Nearly half of those who have retired are self-employed.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're leaving my car.
We were actually waiting for a delay of around 10 percent.
That means we’re very optimistic.
Once the system works.
We brought a ceiling to my prime.
Insurance companies sometimes explain it one-sidedly.
They raised their premiums very quickly.
When we asked what was going on, they said the court decisions did not take into account the existing regulations.
We've made a new cleanup.
We told you to do what you need.
They said no, we'll wait for the trial.
We said it wouldn't be like that.
We've got a split here.
Of course, when they switched to the premium app, some firms refused.
We made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of risk insurers.
I'll tell you what, I'll do it again.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
So I don't find these ceiling price apps right, they forced us to leave.
I'd like to take a look at this three-dimensional thing.
Take into account the system we have.
Two, the system should work normally, that's a price tag on that treadmill.
In addition to the heavy loads, every 100 lire premium paid goes to the tax cuts of almost 30-31 lire SGK.
I'm also working right now, we'll talk to our finance minister.
Thirdly, the technology is evolving rapidly.
Now, traffic accidents will also be seriously reduced structurally over time.
But it's mandatory traffic insurance.
SABAH's manuscript saved his leg
Buerger's disease, which has been around since adolescence, was a disorder previously seen in men, but it is now becoming more common in women.
One of these women is the 36-year-old Mehtap Stop.
The pain that started two years ago was chronically at the base of the foot.
The young woman, who was forced to walk, was at risk of losing her leg, and went to the hospital.
A friend suggested to Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
The headline in SABAH showed the news that ‘Azerbaijan’s Extraordinary Minister saved the life of Haller.’
It turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to emergency surgery.
Shortly after his pain stopped, he's now undergoing oxygen treatment.
Audi to Modify 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Car Manufacturers Confront Reverse Speed
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW board of directors, including Munich, which is considered to ban or limit BMW’s diesel vehicles, said the company, referring to European cities, believed that there were “more intelligent options than driving restrictions”.
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars in Europe would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies have identified these moves as recalls.
European car makers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States of America.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are carcinogenic and can cause me to hang.
The cost of the equipment that automotive companies need to wear to neutralize the dirt smoke produced by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult for the price of cars to remain competitive.
German car makers faced reviews, and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government was accused of embezzling powerful car companies and ignoring the dictates of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s mistakes, which, when a car is being hidden and tested, adjusts its emissions to comply with regulations and relieves it under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been accused in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in the engine development department of Audi, the former president of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected against his guilty return and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi had been dragged into a German criminal investigation, including Volkswagen, after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to get rid of emissions rules in Europe, expanding the U.S.-based investigation.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an excessive share in Volkswagen’s profits.
Fishing for everything you see
The Chairman of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, Prof. Dr. Yusuf <0xC5><0x9E>ük<0xC5><0xB1> <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, warned that fishing should not be skipped to flat areas from 2 meters.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of stroke due to rupture of the neck and spinal cord due to diving into flat water.
Neck fractures most often develop in the 5th or 6th spine.
The characteristic of fractures is that they affect the muscles of the arms and legs at this level as well as the nerves that nourish the respiratory muscles.
Prof. Dr. Ages, "In these types of accidents, our most precious organ, the region of the neck of the spine, is either cut off by the broken spine due to fractures or is compressed into dysfunction."
"Wrong first aid in fatal injuries can not only increase the damage in accidents, it can also lead to death," he said.
Diving in the water is ranked fourth in spinal injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 and the majority are male.
Prof. Dr. Ages, "Fishing in invisible waters should not be skipped."
“No matter how good it is, there can be a serious injury,” he said.
Prof. Dr. Ages also recalled the following:
Depending on the level of spine where the damage to the injury is caused while fishing, a rash can occur to varying degrees in the arms and legs.
You may know how to swim, but water can be tricky.
It may seem like a deep place to you.
The warning boards placed on the coasts of the United States and Australia saw a 70 percent reduction in catching cases in shallow waters.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, “Despite 28 years of sea coast in Turkey, unfortunately there is not even a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul.”
"Every summer prior to the decision, health departments, schools and social awareness projects should provide informational lights or information boards on the coasts and pools in an attractive manner," he said.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, Chairman of the Group for Spinal and Peripheral Nervous Surgery of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, suggested that the following should be done in case of injury:
At the time of the incident, 112 should be called for the first job.
The neck should be kept as stable as possible, should not be moved, should be detected with a rigid collar.
The airway should be provided and the patient should be placed on the opposite side for drainage of running water to the lungs.
It should not be held from the legs and suspended to drain water.
The shape of the patient's neck should not be tried to correct.
The neck may have broken.
But if the spine has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the first aid and the patient’s movement can cause the broken bone pieces to press on the spine and cause the cut to damage.
Provence lavender under threat of climate change
It had become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change.
The lavender is suffering a decline due to drought-like conditions and insects carrying the disease, and this causes great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based Agricultural Research Institute at CRIEPPAM, said: “Lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has exposed much less and mostly in the fall to its rainy season.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small August insect, which is also a leaf-borne microbacterium, and there are many of them in very dry air.”
And many things are in danger.
For perfumes and cosmetics as much as it attracts vacationers, lavender oil is a kind of catch.
Eric Chaisse said: “We have to have very long plant buds with a few large flowers, but we have smaller, less developed or none, or weak buds.
So we have less essential oily parts."
Among the solutions under consideration is better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but there is also the need to spray a protective mixture of mud and water and develop species that are more resistant to dry conditions.
Reporter Murder Draws Gold from Growing Threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce meet on Wednesdays to review plans to include the latest riots, corrupt officers and unending drug wars in the newspapers, led by organized crime in Sinaloa state.
But on this day, they came together to talk about their safety in the shadow of their own tragedies.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists find out what makes them feel safer: to bring their children to the office with them in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: snipers, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and internal sounds are enough.
Reporters suspected of linking drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, government or cartels to salaries are the bad guy who makes a list full of Mexico's chaos dangerous to write in the newspaper.
There are no casualties in violence, while the number of corpses across the country is increasing, more of them are journalists: According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; at least 25 people have died at least 589 federally protected after attacks and threats.
Among the latest deaths are writing directors and Riodoc co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez writes, "The biggest mistake in living and being a journalist in Mexico," in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence everywhere hangs on the front of Riodoce’s building with the words “Justice” a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, show their smiling faces and their glasses.
The workshop takes place two months after his death; reporters talk about their common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, the Committee on the Protection of Journalists dismissed only two.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug smuggling and organized crime each year, the murders of journalists are rarely brought before the law.
In Riodoce, though their hearts are broken, they insist on mentioning violence in Sinaloa, despite the fact that the ground is now more deceptive.
Without knowledge of the killers, without justice, a security consultation works very little, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to spend my time in this work," he says.
"Unless we know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Corolla lasted only a few blocks before being stopped by two men; it was forcibly removed from the car and shot 12 times, for the name of its newspaper, which was translated as the Twelfth River.
The gunman got into his car and ran away and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two adult children remain.
Rumors in Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n tend to circulate freely.
But there is almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
After Guzman’s arrest last year and his return to the U.S. in October, rival groups struggled to fill the gap while Sinaloa became one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields.
In Sinaloa, empty the streets every day for one or more people to be shot and killed, or the graveyard's drug kings to be filled with ornamental, two-storey, larger mosquitoes than many houses to live in.
For a minute, just forget the "sudden" condition that the single cartel controls valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this and being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Riodoce's founding partner and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60), is devastated for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that the two errors contributed to the murder.
The first was an interview with one of Guzman’s rival cartel groups, which was at war with Guzman’s sons, leader Damaso Lopez.
This article may have angered the sons; likely gang members purchased every copy of the print without being distributed to newspaper dealers.
The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after he was handed over to another newspaper where the same story took place.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his assassination was seen as a turning point in violence against Mexican-born journalists.
He had survived for a very long time, his friends and colleagues had assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste in 2013 when he joined five business associates selling $50 shares in the launch of Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, "journalism was impossible without mentioning the topic of drugs," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation for bold and honest news, and with sales, advertisements increased.
The reporters loved to publish life-threatening research without fear of censorship, and the readers had taken themselves to a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to tell.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her journalism in Latin America eight years after her founding.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for showing the courage not to give up wherever the end of Mexico’s drug story stands.
He admitted he was clearly afraid.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug smuggling in Sinaloa was "a way of life."
"You have to accept the task that falls on you as a journalist, either you play this or you play the fool.
I don't want him to ask me, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'"
Riodoce's staff misses Valdez; the disbelieving prankster, his friends, who are generous in his hugs and advice, and his teachers who know how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always put on his hat.
He would go to the bar in front of his office called El Guayabo and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for his routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and survive.
"If you're dealing with their women, their children, their clean jobs, the secret plane tracks they use to transport drugs, they don't like it."
Bojorquez said, "These things were crossing the line."
The result was a high-degree autopsy even in the best of times and was self-defense.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away.
Riodoce writing director Andres Villarreal said, "It's a sense of smell that can be tricked... and what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa are not valid; the same is not true in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to smugglers of profit, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The ground is constantly changing.
No cell phones are suddenly allowed in the room where Riodoce staff met for security training; days ago, it turned out that spyware only sold to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to escape the 104-degree (40 centigrade) temperature in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's office, located in a four-storey building in a middle-class section of Culiacan.
Half-seriously, some of the reporters wondered if the governor himself was one of the 50 percent of the cops he said were unreliable.
Reporters spent months in the mountainous rural cuts, which drug gangs controlled as a faction.
In this week's issue, Riodoce is covering three main stories.
Former big boxer Julio Cesar Chavez had the murder of his brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, there was a revelation of government spending concentrated in the governor's homeland.
And a block away from the prosecutor's office, there was the kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew, caution prevailed: the restaurant was a favor for both drug smugglers and authorities.
One reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician in the ruling Corporate Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated almost every stage of politics in the last century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier events, including the escape of one of Guzman’s sons, including the escape from a military raid at the scene of the incident.
Just months ago, they read, looking at Valdez's corner for the best source of information about the kidnapping.
Due to its thin structure, Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco", said, "We already knew what happened before."
"All our channels of communication with our resources at the moment have been cut off."
As the staff turns into something they never expected, activists in the name of the press, Valdez’s office is re-used as a warehouse for banners and stickers protesting the murders of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up several banners and went to the show the next morning for another journalist at the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was found, and according to DNA tests, officials say it was him.
Throughout the country, journalists have expressed their thoughts louder in organized protests by writing "Help the Press" to the stairs and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case in remote Washington.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he asked the government to be assigned a task other than to do the news, thinking that his anger had degraded his neutrality.
Valdez continued to say that journalists in Mexico are “encircled” by organized crime, accomplices of official officials and a carefree society.
In his latest book called “Drug-Journalism,” he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by politicians and security forces cooperating with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 linked half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, "You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you."
The murders obviously had a cold shower effect.
No one remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
The body was found along with a note that was signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and headphones, set next to his broken head.
Reporter Miroslava Breach in the northern border state of Chihuahua preferred to shut down some publications such as El Norte after her assassination in March.
After the assassination of their directors in 2004, El Manana from Nuevo Laredo continues.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez called out to the drug cartels with the headline on the front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own states, or even their own country.
It's a burqa decision.
They find it hard to find work in exile and still roam the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after fleeing Veracruz, they are captured by photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City with four women in 2015.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it's a dance every day with these high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that he was frightened by the news of his drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell and that's why I'm a reporter," he said.
A recent Saturday night, mid-afternoon, preparations were being made for the completion of the latest issue, while Riodoce's writing directors were sitting on the elevator outside the office drinking beer, and at the same time began to ring the phones.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a resort on the beach, resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages around, the war continued to rage.
They put the news on Riodoce's website through cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would remain in the event of a change the next day.
Sirens have recently begun to move, there's another gunfight around.
Bojorquez quickly looked at the police officers in charge to see if they were on fire.
Even if they were afraid, they wouldn't show.
Under the enormous portrait of the founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was on display to see all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce following in his footsteps.
"How can you think of shutting down," said Bojorquez, "when on the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him out to report on the street?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a terrible one.
Researchers have now revealed that the first findings of an incredible creature of elbow size found by a Canadian miner have been very well preserved, describing it as the ‘Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs’.
It was so well-preserved that they could understand that the money money skin was reddish brown and they could say that it was a ‘problematic past’.
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as “the best-preserved armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
Fossils have lived 110 million to 112 million years ago since the mid Cretaceous, a newly discovered nodozer species.
The exceptionally well-preserved condition surprised the researchers who described it as ‘really wonderful’.
The plant-eating armored fossil is the best-conserved of its kind, according to reports in National Geographic.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk excavated the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He shot something that looked strange from the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Over the next 6 years, they spent 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of land exposing the wild animal.
After so much work, the completed result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, the lead author at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited, said, “If you shorten your eyes a little, you can almost believe it’s sleeping.”
"As one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur species in the history of science, it will pass as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
The researchers, examining the skin, found that, although it was coated with armor and resembled a walking tank, this plant was likely facing a serious threat from the meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts suggest that it is being hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to better mix around and overcome its enemies.
The creature, from the 110-million-year-old nodozer family, first appeared in manuscripts in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have now completed their work and named the wild animal, the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours in a laborious way to unearth it, as the Borealopelta marmitchelli.
The exceptional preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to document the shape of the coins with the pattern and the armor on the body.
They discovered contrast shadowing, which is a common method of defense in the animal realm and means that the upper part of the creature is darker from the bottom.
Although contrast shadowing is common, the findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds the contrast shadowed animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur is under enough pressure from the meat-eating dinosaurs, and that evolution likes to hide as a way of survival.
But the most modern animals using the counter-shadow (e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos) are much smaller and explain much more to be a hunt; meaning that this nodozar has faced a serious challenge to survive.
Brown said, “The massive, powerful hunting of a heavy-armored animal in Cretaceous shows how dangerous dinosaur predators can be.”
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in their pellets also revealed that the dinosaur’s skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for tips on life, including preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate in its final meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was dragged into the sea, where it sank to the surface of the ocean on its back.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and probably rivers and oceans had spread far more inland than they are now.
"The nodosor is really worth noting that it's completely covered and protected with dust skin, but also that the original shape of the animal is also preserved in a 3-dimensional way," Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same as it looks in the early Cretaceous today.
You don’t need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you shorten your eyes a little, you can almost believe it’s sleeping.”
Cretaceous was the time when giant theropods, giant dinosaurs of meat standing on two feet, traveled on Earth.
Although he was the king of all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armoured dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by a number of monstrous ancestors.
Among these is the 38 ft (11.5m) long Acrocanthosaurus, a monster weighing 6 tons.
The latest findings in the journal Current Biology, scientists believe that Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found excavating the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, this best-conserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, is complete from its nose to its hips.
The creature averages about 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has a neck of 2 20 inches in length that comes out of its shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored herb was dragging into the open sea in what is now western Canada, until it was dragged by a flowing river.
But the dinosaur's grave under the sea has preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the pieces of leather still cover the entire armor layers along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko writes for National Geographic, this degree of conservation "is as rare as winning the penguin.
The more I look at her, the more unbelievable she is.
Fossilized leather pieces still cover all-woven coats of armor that are dotted to the skull of the dinosaur.
The right foreleg lies on its side, 5 fingers pointing upwards.
I can count the money on the foot."
Don't say whiten your teeth.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are the dreams of every person.
While people resort to a variety of ways to whiten their teeth, the head of the Association of Oral Laser Applications, Nükhet Berk, warns that they should stay away from products sold on the market or on the internet.
Noting that these types of substances are drawing the mine surface, that the teeth are stained so that they will never be recycled, Nükhet Berk said that "whitening of teeth with chemicals applied by dentists or sticking nails on the surface of teeth" can be said to be fine porcelain surfaces.
Noting that the protection of dental health prevents the development of many diseases, Berk shares the following information, noting that aesthetic applications are important in terms of both dental and dental health as well as good laughter:
As long as there is no disorder or genetic factors in the dental structures, the teeth of young people are usually white.
Due to aging, scratching of tooth mines and frequent consumption of erosive or dark-coloured beverages, the teeth become darker over the years.
Whitening of teeth can be done with chemicals applied by dentists or fine porcelain surfaces applied to the surface of the teeth, such as adhesive nails, with minimal or no wear on the surface of the teeth.
Never whiten your teeth with products sold on the market or on the internet.
Because these substances draw the surface of the mine, the teeth are stained so that they will never be recycled again.
Ke<0xC3><0xA7>iören Municipality has been providing "Home Dental and Oral Health Service" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens since 2011.
The 65-year-old Koksal Gungör, who has been in bed for 24 years in Ke<0xC3><0xA7>iören's Awakening District, "has heard of this service from my wife's Ke<0xC3><0xA7>iören Municipality."
We called the city, they came right away.
He said: "I'm not neglecting my dental care, at least because of this service."
Kezban Gök<0xC3><0xA7>e, a 72-year-old daughter of 95-year-old Gülizar Ta<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who lives in P<0xC4><0xB1>narba<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> District, has been living in bed dependent for 7.5 years.
When I came to the city, I saw the posters of this service and immediately called.
We have been receiving this service regularly for 4 years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the phrase "we are very pleased."
There is also no health insurance requirement for a service that is completely free of charge.
The "Chief" in the Turkish Army
My dear readers, very interesting decisions have been made at the meeting of the Supreme Military Council (SMC) held the previous day, especially in terms of the Navy.
This Force was brought under the command of not a paramilitary, but a paramilitary.
It's an almost never-before-seen practice in our army.
So how did that happen?
The Force Commander Oramiral Bülent Bostano<0xC4><0x9F>lu had completed his term, he was already going to retire...
And it did.
Now it had come to Veysel Kösele, the only admiral in command.
Veysel Pasha, who had been a victim of the gang in the past and had been detained for some time, was supposed to be a commander in the normal senior ranks.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to put it very briefly, Commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 are not promoted from the top of the Navy.
In this case, there was only one Admiral in the Navy.
The vacant post was to be brought to him: Naval Commander Oramiral Veysel Kösele, number two.
So what happened next?
Koramiral Adnan <0xC3><0x96>zbal, who was in sixth place, was appointed by the government.
Now look at that picture!
Oramiral Veysel is standing there, but he's being assigned a lower-ranking commander instead!
It's a senior, it's under the command of the senior.
What will happen next?
An oramiral, who is superior to Rutbeke, does not serve at the command of a lieutenant-general, who is unruly from himself.
He won't take orders from her, he won't.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this offensive situation, if he has not been sent to retirement, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the message that the government has already given him: "Goodbye Veysel Pasha!"
The news that he resigned in his hours yesterday afternoon was circulated, but the situation had not yet been officially announced.
Now let's look back at these things!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for this or that reason, forced him to resign, and replaced him with a 6th-ranking reconnaissance and undermined the traditional "Chef" concept of our army.
There's politics in it, and we don't know what's behind the curtain.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll all learn together!
Dear readers, I have tried to tell you very briefly above, especially the main event in the Turkish army is very important.
Not just in order.
For example, the officer who graduated from Harp School in 10th grade is more senior than the one who graduated in 11th grade.
He who promotes the first rank to the general is more senior than he who promotes the second rank.
We have experienced concrete examples of this senior event in the Istiklal War.
Commander of the Garp Front Ismet Pasha...
You've got two armies on your command.
Army and 2nd Army.
We arrived in 1922, and our armies carried out a great assault and chased out the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names expected to be assigned to army command.
One of them is a squirrel.
He is offered command of the army, but he says, "The service is unmanageable from me, I cannot enter into his command."
Another name is Yakub <0xC5><0x9E>evki (Supra<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>) Pa<0xC5><0x9F>a.
Teacher at Atatürk's Academy of Harp...
He is a valuable and senior commander who has taken part in various battles, whom he loves, whom he values, whom he calls "Teacher."
In 1919, soldiers and civilians were captured by Turkish forces and taken to the island of Malta by the British.
On his return home, he is reluctant about the command of the army, and says the same thing: "The commander of the Western Front is without command from me, I cannot command from him."
But Atatürk convinces him of the request of gratitude, and Yakut Shevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a colorful name...
Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan (Sabis) Pasha.
He's a very talkative, constantly criticizing soldier.
He is a commander who has fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also exiled to Malta by the British, fleeing there and coming to Ankara via Ku<0xC5><0x9F>adas<0xC4><0xB1>.
When he was offered command of the army, Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan Pa<0xC5><0x9F>a said the same: “I cannot fight at the command of Ismet, who is unleashed from me.”
But he's convinced...
But let’s see that after starting the mission, the Garp Front Commander, in whose command he enters, is constantly arguing with <0xC4><0xB0>smet Pa<0xC5><0x9F>a, making the incident happen, and disquieting the army...
And shortly before the great attack, he is taken off duty and sent to retirement, replacing the bearded Nurettin Easter.
After that, Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan never fixes his pasta with Atatürk.
The main problem in the Turkish army is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he has to go out.
Veysel Közele is the last example of this.
How an activist was left to learn the answer to the question "Who are the streets?".
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
A day after coming to New York City for a trip, he sat in the bed of Airbnb, which was rented by the locals of St. Louis, and started surfing on his phone on Facebook.
It's like someone in high school shared it.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised to learn that no one else in the content stream shared this information, shutting down Facebook and opening Twitter.
A user named <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted in his content stream.
The rapper from the St. Louis area tweeted the death of Michael Brown alive, when he was 18 years old, he was killed by an unarmed black, white police officer in Ferguson Missouri.
He shared a picture of Brown's dead body, who will stay there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "It's wild."
But death was nothing new for him or his society.
He left his phone later that evening to return to tweets about gathering people on Canfield Drive.
The police tapes had pictures of a man holding a banner that claimed to be Brown's father, and that he had a banner on it that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
A police officer watched a live broadcast of a dog standing in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another police officer said, he fired his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell recalled saying, "It's not usual."
“This is not the kind of murder we are used to and typical of.”
I felt scared there.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He took a return ticket and went home the next day.
He took his 6-year-old daughter from his father's house at 11 a.m. and decided to go with him to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come out on August 11th, the subject of a new documentary, "Who's the Streets?".
It is a story from the standpoint of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, and people who live in that society and fill the streets with the answers they seek.
While Ferrell was driving his vehicle to Ferguson with a flowery dress and a crown-granted daughter suited to him, they went back to talking about the "experiences of blacks and the circumstances of blacks" they had done earlier that morning.
"Do you remember me teaching you black people to fight for what they believe in?" he recalled.
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t true.
I couldn’t take it,” Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is a result of what happened in the past.
He must know, see, and grow up in it.
Not only should we not develop well in the field of activism and organization, but we should also know the layers of black experience and the state of blackness and liberation, what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Even if I were lucky enough to have her live an experience she would not personally experience rude racism, there would be no difference from any black woman-child.
I feel like I'm going to hurt him by protecting him from this."
When they arrived at Ferguson, their first stops were on the South Florissant Road, which turned into a sort of camp for activists, where they were waiting to talk about the subject, which was opposite the police station and resulted in no subsequent conviction of the crime to officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter contacted the local business owners who prepared packaged food.
They prepared bags and helped bring them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of action was slowly being formed.
While a student at Missouri State University, he said he was the president of the Nurses’ Union and focused on food justice and health injustice in the black community, “My activism has completely changed after August 9th.”
“I had no experience in organizing it.
He came by himself."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film’s co-directors, at an evening show.
Folayan said he and his image director Lucas Alvarado-Farar wanted to "believe" what happened.
Ferrell came up with a question: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can use?”
This suspicion was usually reported by numerous individuals, including whites; to come to a society and take advantage of its pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: “We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson can’t be concentrated, and we decided to do it differently.”
Folayan had already made contact with fellow director Damon Davis, a region artist known for his actions on inmates who had been sentenced to death.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, followed by the other six locals as well as the "Who's the Streets?" team in the years following Brown's shooting.
David said, "This document is not that someone should speak for us or speak for us, but that we should speak."
“That was the basic thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that’s how I’ll be represented.”
While not focusing on Ferrell’s experiences, while showing that the movement is “not about a loyal leader, it’s about getting together in society,” he proved that film participants are the most vulnerable, he said.
As a result, "Who's the Streets?" surprisingly documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like being in love and marrying his wife.
Laughing at the finished product at first sight, Ferrell said, "I felt like naked."
“But when I was doing this work and humanizing black people, I realized there could be some sensitivity.”
Ferrell’s story also solidifies and refocusses the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders who derive the <0x23>BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media following the assassination of black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay.
“Black gay women in leadership generally held the movement up,” Ferrell said, “and that’s because we’re constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of it."
Folayan commented: “The monstrosity is really being held up by black women and many gay black women.”
Still, Ferrell insists on "when there is nothing in this kind of positive action" and therefore his identities are not chosen.
He says, "He was the one who put this energy into motion."
“But it’s no coincidence that she’s in the front row, because as a black gay woman, there’s a lot you’ll lose by living a life in these intersections.
You can feel his energy from the screen.”
Meanwhile, at Ferguson, the news cameras are already gone, but there are disturbing racial links between the police and the community.
Ferrell has been under surveillance for another 2.5 years due to shutting down the highway during a demonstration.
My home defines the socio-political atmosphere in the region as "carousel" in one word.
Still, Ferguson keeps the song he excavated in his memory just three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Winning is our mission.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round!
Speaking to NBC Sports, Irving said, “The world is not round.”
The world is flat.
They get used to things like that by scaring people.
Oh, man, don't ask too many questions.
Because the more information you dissolve, the more information comes out.
That's crazy.
Is the world flat?
Or is it revolving around itself?
I think you should investigate this.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They are lying to us! he used his words.
Irving said, "I believed I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was going round and round.
Do you really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they send back is coming back.
He's not coming back!
The information they give us is inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for that truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is battling with the Cleveland Cavaliers this season with 24.4 points and 5.9 assists.
An Appreciative Similarity: Artist Uses Chelsea Manning’s DNA to Create Portraits
White, black, and brown, wrapped over the cables on the ceiling in the middle of the room in the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many faces that are almost unambiguously similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, from ear sticks and cut hair sent to him by Chelsea Manning.
Former intelligence analyst Manning, who was serving a 35-year sentence after leaking secret diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website, sent his cut hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Similarity.
This is the product of a two-year correspondence between a trans-woman pardoned by Barack Obama and a leading opponent, Manning, who combines her discipline with her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and her three-day sentence for the completion of her mission.
By analysing the DNA extracted from Manning algorithmically and using 30 portraits of what a person with this gene data can look like, Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits of what a person with this gene data could look like, not only the processability of the DNA data (many ways to understand it, but also the determinism that comes from the essence of the comments), but also the identity.
Born Bradley Edward, Manning, who clearly defined herself as a woman as a teenager, was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, including the six Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
The image was pressed by the prison, so that there was only one photograph: a sandy, black-and-white selfie with a missing platinum wig that Manning was sitting in the driver's seat, which was visibly irritating.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg achieved success with his 2012 project, with the huge slump of Stranger Senses.
In this, the artist made a picture of what these people could look like by filtering out DNA from the leaks of cigarette butts and forensic pieces like gum.
It was then that he received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait that could accompany this writing," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press release.
They couldn’t be visited at the time, they couldn’t take a picture, so they reached Chelsea and asked if they were interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected letter friends, making many correspondence exchanges within a two-year period.
They even illustrated the Printed Images by Shoili Kanungo, a cartoon book in which the president forgives Chelsea’s punishment and can see his exhibition in person, a future of fantasy.
The fact that Obama really wanted Manning's evacuation a few days after the book was released was a happy coincidence that came well after seven merciless years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump is finding new, tweetable ways to blind those who have leaked information about the government and the transgender soldiers to the sharp divisions he is seeking to repair, there is something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is currently opening.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason."
An artist's statement written on the wall of the galleries, which Manning's signature in huge dimensions is below it (the dot of the letter "i" in the soybean is sealed with the heart), "makes an "automatic distinction" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
In front of the wall is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: many Cs, Gs, and A's written in lead pencils.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us how surprisingly similar we are to each other, at least as a biological creation.
"What I'm hoping people will take away from this is that it doesn't matter how open our genome is to interpretation and how subjective genetic data is," said Dewey-Hagborg, who exhibited his 2007 video work Taklit Memories.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's one of 30 of those stories."
The last piece of the exhibition held in a single room is a page from the short-line novel that previously mentioned.
Here Manning is depicted in King Kong style, when he comes out with a speaker from the United States Winters of Discipline.
"They're saying they've won your speech."
"So don't ever shut up."
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me."
"When I talk about it, my hair is still sticking."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person (as he had dreamt quite foretelling from the cartoon book), but when he sees it, he will be greeted with masks with his own genetic imitations gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything else in the exhibition, genetic haplogroups up to the size of Manning (5"2, Manning's length), written with lead pencils, were especially made.
Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits, "I had put them on the wall in the past but wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted this to be perceived as a mass movement with Chelsea, as the movement behind his release," he said.
Northwestern Education Officer and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Murder
Police said a nationwide manhunt was launched for a Northwestern University education official and a suspected search for a Northwestern University employee after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook's administrative district records show that on Monday, arrest warrants for first-degree murder were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) without bail on the allegation that they were involved in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed many times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27th.
Officers received a call, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with many deep cuts in his body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was reported dead at the scene and police were actively looking for two suspects while investigating the stab as a murder.
Lathem has been teaching in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of relations, said in a statement in an email that Lathem was in administrative custody and that it was forbidden to enter Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
In an email from the University and Somerville University, a spokesperson said: “We are in contact with the U.K. police and are ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in whatever way they need it.”
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Communications chief Anthony Guglielmi, from the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Guglielmi said, "The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify them are intensifying."
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities helped to find suspects.
Guglielmi said he received a phone call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who had received a mysterious hint that something had just happened in apartment 1008.
The police have described the scene as terrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
He said Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be in the building by security cameras.
Guglielmi said, "We believe the victim has an affair with his teacher, Latham."
The management at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying: “Police are still working on the victim’s timeline and history, and are investigating a number of suspects, including a possible family incident.”
Italy to take over German ship.
Italian police said the ship, Iuventa, was carrying out search-and-rescue activities for refugees in the Mediterranean on Lampedusa Island yesterday.
Police, who also shared the records of telephone conversations with journalists that the organization claimed belonged to two members, said the operation was carried out within the scope of an investigation initiated by the Trapani Prosecutor’s Office in October 2016.
It is suggested that the members of the Jugend Rettet, who are also working in favour of illegal immigration on the Libya-Italy line, have brought refugees taken directly from the boats of Libyan human traffickers to Italy at least three times.
This crime of juveniles being questioned by prosecutors includes allegations that they have worked with some persons from Libya’s Coastal Security.
In a statement made by the organization, it was stated that their priorities will continue to save human life, evaluating the accusations made against them.
In addition to the ships under the Italian Coastal Security and European Union (EU) mission, about 9 international civil society organisations are also responsible for the search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government has drawn up a document of 13 codes of conduct for compliance with these institutions, and had required that it be signed.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete WADA road map in the short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Russian Anti-Doping Agency) to reopen.
"A certain stage has been completed in meeting the roadmap criteria, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map has been updated in this context," Mutko said on Thursday.
The prime minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulatory Sleep Roadmap, which was recently published on the institution’s website, describing the criteria for RUSADA’s re-opening.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future."
However, one criterion mentioned on the list is that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the state-backed doping investigation in Russian sport, which was carried out by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
Referring to the issue, Mutko said: “While our anti-doping system acknowledges a failure, we are also conducting an investigation.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there is no government program and we will not accept anything that has not existed.”
Mutko's remarks echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport in the early hours of the day, Smirnov acknowledged the past problems in the Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains positions and regulations that create contradictions.
No one wants to accept the report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA in the aftermath of the November 2005 doping scandal.
However, under the supervision of international experts and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD), testing planning and coordination was allowed this June.
In July, following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli announced that RUSADA was “progressing in the right direction” to become business again.

The video, decorated with dialogues by Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also shared from the websites of major newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
President Galatasaray will not return empty-handed
Galatasaray's former president, Faruk Süren, harshly criticized President Dursun Uzbekistan, who went to Bucharest and Ndiaye for transfer to the capital Ankara to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the special explanations made by the legendary president for SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek interview: "We were finished when we left."
The President of Galatasaray will not go in vain, nor will he return empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasaray President does not go to the footballer.
The footballer comes to the president's feet.
Of course they meet, kiss his hand or hug him...
But whoever the actor is, the president doesn't go to his feet.
You give 9 million euros to the player who Osmanlisport bought for 300,000 euros...
It will be $7.5 million, not $9 million with bonuses!
You've already made a big investment, of course you'll play and it'll be 7.5...
Uzbek’s performances: I don’t want to worry.
But the situation is in the middle.
G.Saray's values are erosion.
It’s not just football, it’s all wrong.
The one that's going to change that is the Couch Board and the General Board.
As far as I know, the members are happy!
Start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness at the e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, helpless, or even worse, misleading.
Even though he pledged anonymity, some employees did not trust him for as long as he did.
Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company in San Francisco over hair care, says “There has never been consistency or objectivity.”
He also called someone from outside for help.
A new kind of human resources is emerging to enable start-ups to understand how their employees feel.
They are designed to produce and license a software to measure the employment of employees, which is designed to enable companies to carry out random surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with a direct helplines, and in some cases direct helplines, which provide them with an anonymity and complaint.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and chairman of the Redwood City start-up, which measured the employability of employees by software analytics tools, said: “There are now tools that monitor your health, like Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company Fitbit?”
Errett says that using Glint, employees understand better what they think and feel three years later.
In addition to providing specific surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, it offers a heat map showing which parts of the company receive the most complaints and which director has low likes points, so the reasons for these can be summarized.
In order not to be the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to have knowledge about the culture of their workplaces; Uber has been in a scandal since it explicitly described a harassment environment in which those who say what a former employee thinks in a blog post is being punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this demand for supervision means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to the financial technology insights website Let’s Talk Payments, the global management, regulation, and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in the Denver Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helped companies detect and prevent misbehavior, increased among Uber’s disrepute debates earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 customers including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct personalized “fast” inspections, collect real-time confidential responses, and extract heat maps from problem areas.
It also offers a helpline where employees can send an anonymous message where they can report bad behavior.
If the president is accused, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
Covercent’s founder and president, Patrick Quinlan, said, “The public court has taken over the regulators.”
Quinlan said: “If a company is misbehaving its employees or not acting ethically, even if regulators don’t get involved, it can face costly consequences because of consumer boycotts, employee benefits, or lawsuits.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to keep employees informed of the principles and procedures and provide easy access to the company’s headquarters.
When an employee wanted to report a problem in advance, he had to find a phone number or e-mail from the company headquarters, he was in a formal complaint, and he hoped it would be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday’s chief legal adviser, James Vitrano, said these were mostly scary and disturbing experiences, not a good way to follow up on employee complaints.
But now that the company is using Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden from managers sitting in office, city, or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage practice) can be detected and solved more quickly.
Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group, said: “I can get even closer to this employment experience from a holistic, 360-degree perspective.”
“We’re also protecting our shareholders against business cases.”
After accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed in 2002 due to breaches of ethical values caused by the Enron scandal, companies took ethics, values, and employee-related issues more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after “social media came to their senses,” companies realized they couldn’t prevent dirty laundry from becoming viral.
"Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
They offer both Glint and Convercent software as a service and receive recurring fees for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity where both start-ups are endorsed by venture capital investors.
Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising its total capital to $47 million.
Glint provided $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the nature, cultures, and venture capital of companies that are linked to each other, these investments are not much of a surprise.
Increasing research shows that today’s employees expect more from their workplaces than ever before.
High salaries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are only minimal requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, LinkedIn’s vice president of global benefits and employee experience using both Convercent and Glint, said: “When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard and when they are more satisfied with the work they do, she succeeds.
Investors make a profit when their portfolio companies do a good job; companies do a good job if they are honest with their employees and if they feel they belong to the company.
If third-party analysis tools promise to increase employees’ honesty and sense of belonging, it’s not surprising that they find support.
Having data about employee engagement is important according to the specialists of workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the company’s responsibilities fail to act.
In fact, a company can create an expectation that the change is coming if they want feedback from their employees.
And if the expectation doesn’t come fast enough, or if it doesn’t come at all, it can lead to disappointment and make employees feel like they’re breaking up.
Russell Raath, who is the head of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International and makes the mistake of relying too much on companies to collect data, said, “If you’re going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to talk to 4,000.”
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a problem was reported at Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were overwhelmed by the pace of the decision-making mechanism and communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run it will turn into more workers in this kind of industry, which is known to be a high number of employees.
Vitrona said, “If you don’t depend on creating a culture of transparency, you lose people.”
“And if you lose people, you’re going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."
The NCAA's lifting two workouts every day is a long day for the Bruins.
It arrives at 11 p.m. and they hang out to chat on the edge of a new training ground on campus by a team of UCLA football players.
Some have ripped off their tops, sliding backs from the trouble of the first day at the training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these empty minutes make up the midday break.
After 3 hours of practice, players enrolled in summer classes will return to their home country and work on their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30am the next morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before returning Tuesday: “The next three days are a torture for these guys.”
Organized to lift the burden on players, the NCAA's lifting of two workouts a day, at least until Friday's finals are over, actually extended their days.
So UCLA’s first three workouts were scheduled to start at 7.15 p.m. to adapt to players’ already tight schedule.
In exchange for not having two workouts a day, Bruins takes a week closer to the start of the season, and trains for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood during summer school.
They plan to do 18 practice until August 20 before the official match preparations for their openings against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said the players had added new pencils to their intensive work program, but that the NCAA supported the rule change.
Mora said, "We're putting a huge load on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging."
“And they’ve been through this recently; they’re working, they’re great kids.
I think when we get to Saturday we'll have more time, it'll be really great."
UCLA will stop their workouts when the camp is over; it’s not easy when the luxury hotel Luskin Center, held to the rain and the football next door, is thought to be lying on the line of sight.
The Bruins players are scheduled to settle at the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits that during the season there may be a problem with the clearance of these rooms.
Mora said, "We'll be safe."
“It’s a real concern and it’s not too far away to think that someone would rent a room and sit there and film a workout.
If you have a video of an exercise, that’s a pretty good thing.
But we're gonna have security there, and we're gonna have security at the parking lot up there at 8:00.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook Increases Story Authentication Power to Fight Fake News
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story verifiers and show their findings under the original sharing, as the world’s largest online social network said Thursday it was trying to fight what are called fake news.
In a statement on the company’s website, he said they would use updated machine learning to detect potential fraud and send it to story verifiers and that this would potentially show the results of story verification under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main outlets of news known as fake news, which many believe affected the 2016 US presidential election.
The French voter’s failure to get to the fake news cell before the presidential election in May and to support Germany’s plan to quickly eliminate hate-filled social media shares in the pre-election there in the event of a major coup d’état.
In a separate statement on Thursday, Facebook said a test of a new story verification feature was being launched in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In a blog post, Facebook news stream product manager Sara Su said: “In addition to seeing which stories are discussed by third-party story verifiers, people want more resources about what they read and share to make informed decisions.”
He added that Facebook will continue to test its “relevant article” feature and work on other changes in the news stream to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic: The Story of a Castle in England
In the recent past, the small Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music clip and became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, inspired by a comic novel written by Jamie Rhodes from Yorkshire with dusty hair and a passion for historical documents, Scotney witnessed a 700-year-old history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in the city.
“I find it beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says in a polite manner.
"What a personal bond it is to hold this letter in my hand."
A Castle in England, from Edward's era to the Middle Ages, each story is documented by a family who lived in Scotland by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg).
This isn’t Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014’s Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, a project inspired by stories at the British Library that he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I even had my eyes filled with the fingerprints on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a dual agent who worked for the supporters of King James," he says.
"That was the fingerprint of his head!"
The letters always smell like that, because then you would light a fire for the light.
For a 300-year-old future, that smell feels like he's there.
“I love the archives!”
As an old-fashioned paper lover, it seems too good to get support from the National Trust and the British Arts Council and be able to stay in a castle for almost four months ("I stayed a little longer than I needed to be warmly welcomed, to be honest.")
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" Victorian castle, scanning the archives, and working on many treasures and antiquities, such as centuries-old bottles of backbone heads and pits mounted on the manor's walls.
He spoke to patrons, gardeners, and sometimes artists who worked on the illustrations of his book, and circled the grounds and remains of the old castle.
Then at night, "the whiskey was drunk and put into writing."
The National Trust's detailed history is relatively unknown because it was able to reach full access only when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff only began to take up the archives, which he described as: "For centuries the aristocrats were saying, 'Oh, throw it between the ceilings.'
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that define the boundaries of who has what: "You think land disputes will be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a hut on which two families fought.
“Fuck off, guys!”
Some of the stories in the collection, including The Labourer who left the newly built castle to join the Peasant Rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a springboard to make a broader entrance to English history.
"There is a record in this book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex, that there was a rebellion in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
“The famous Revolt had started around here, and I thought that a rebellion could be a good starting point.
“Maybe these two are related?”
Other stories are closely related to the castle’s history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of Darrell’s family, who hid a Jesuit priest for 7 years during the English Reformations.
Or The Smuggler, an 18th-century smuggler believed to have filled a coffin with stones and buried his own grave (a revelation made years later when the coffin was removed from the ground).
The Darrells, the most beloved of Rhodes’s Scotney family, said: “These gentlemen seemed to be pretty organized, they were always in debt, and they were spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
In different generations, Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who are capable of smuggling female heirs.
Rhodes completes his mission in the castle, in search of other single writing experiences.
In Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week work on a comic book about the life of Elsämänmäki, a sanatorium in the early 20th century that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a separate place in his mind.
"I'm sorry I broke up," he says.
"Sanki: 'Ah, I have to go now and face my fucking real life.'"
Reaction to 'Maho' by Meral Ak<0xC5><0x9F>ener
The Secretary General of the Nationalist Movement Party, <0xC4><0xB0>smet Büyükataman, made a written statement on recent allegations of resignation of MHP in the social media and press.
Using the expression “but running” from the corners of the social media and “some old rifles of Marxists” to the MHP, he appealed to the games and countertops to prevent the supremacy movement from continuing to exist under the MHP roof after September 12.
Growing up, he said:
"How corrupt, the criminal record of the Turkish people, who cannot bear the historical existence of the Turkish people, who do not tear down the homeland of the Turks, his hands are clogged, his ideas are blurred, his mind is confused," he said.
"Now that they have left, 410 of the MHP Kocaeli Gölcük County Organization's management and members and 215 of the MHP Bursa's Yeni<0xC5><0x9F>ehir district have resigned."
250 resignations are misdirected to the public with unprofessional news such as 300 resignations.
In the columns of the newspaper lies, deception is deepened.
The number of guests in the places we’re talking about as a resignation that we reach this number does not exceed the fingers of a hand.
Yuyukataman, who has been described as "in speech" regarding resignations, said that the polls he referred to as "in speech" were aimed at misdirecting the public and managing perceptions.
“The propaganda and campaigns aimed at creating perceptions against MHP will be reversed,” he said.
MHP Secretary General Büyükataman, who points out that MHP is an important and indispensable player in Turkish politics, said about the resignations:
The rise of the sword to destroy the place the MHP took in the conscience of the Turkish people is not enough power of the old Marxists.
All the comments made lie behind a dirty account of the methods of applied perception management.
Because politics and the media have looked at the MHP base.
While we are amongst us, those who do not do any good work and effort in favor of our party, do not mean anything in our favor to resign now.
What about those who can't resign from our party at the expense of their souls?
He has not touched the MHP well in his life, he has not shared our memories, he has not understood our country, he has not participated in the struggle, he must always find another occupation for himself, a charred, heart-stained man.
The efforts of those who do not undermine the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party are an effort to rehabilitate, debate and disenfranchise.
And he will surely turn around and hit his owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last stronghold of the Turkish people, despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, for those he claimed to target the MHP, the "politicians", the "political hackers" said, "the nationalist movement is not without."
"External mosquitoes inside the root that feeds beyond the ocean will not achieve their goals, no matter what the cost," he said.
The MHP’s Büyükataman, who used the phrase, “The traitors will turn mad and be ashes in the fire,” in his statement, ranking opposition parties and terrorist organizations together, he made the following claims: “If you make it out of your own mind, you will make it out of your own mind.”
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of MHP-free Turkey planners; the MHP-free government, the MHP-free Assembly, we fought until the end with the bastards who wanted it.
Now we're going to ruin the games, we're going to ruin the players.
"The patent of the supremacy is on the MHP," he used the phrases imitating Meral Ak<0xC5><0x9F>ener: "As in Banker Bilo, an ex-Greenhouse made, I'll take the Maho peasants to Germany from the villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's the villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's villager's name's name's name's name's name's name's name's name's name's name's name's name's name's in Germany's name's name's name's name's name's name.
That’s their issue, but the only thing we want from these inmates is to be new to the place where they go.
Kjaer signed for Sevilla.
Kjaer signed an official contract for the transfer of 12.5 million euros from the yellow-backed team to Sevilla and the Spanish team as the most expensive defence transfer ever.
The Danish star will wear the No. 4 form in Seville.
It’s easier for families with babies than that.
According to a statement from the THY Press Advisory, the national airline, which keeps the comfort and satisfaction of its passengers at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable throughout the flight, continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience.
In this regard, the "baby travel kit", which is designed to examine the needs of babies and their families between the ages of 0 and 2 years, began to be available to infants passengers travelling on intercontinental flights from August.
The kit is made with a specially designed bag; the bottom replacement cover includes a disposable mattress front, cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton lining and chest pad.
Products that do not contain harmful chemicals such as parabens, alcohol and paints were produced taking into account the sensitivity of the baby’s skin.
Washington Is Changing Green Card Rules
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said there would be a new U.S. immigration plan that would change the Green Card rules.
Legal immigrants are expected to cut by 50,000 a year, with stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and were also supported by the president.
The bill will be debated on both sides of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. gives its citizens a green card to other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, those with the financial resources they can afford, and those with the capabilities that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Authors commented on Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e-Sturm Graz match
Two seasons I couldn’t find, I couldn’t see the excitement and exhilaration again, K<0xC4><0xB1>d<0xC4><0xB1>köy...
A team of "smart-hearted" Aykut Kocaman took out in the absences was on the ground to make a deal with his supporters to "stand behind us".
We can criticize the game, the position or the performance, but I haven’t seen a game that works and looks like that for a long time.
He was clear in the first match but yesterday he put the apollets on his shoulder; Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e's field commander now Valbuena.
There was a problem with his age when he was transferred, but the words of the Great had the phrase "indistinct character".
Thirty years ago, we gave R<0xC4><0xAB>za <0xC4><0x8C>al<0xC4><0xB1>mbay the name of the atomic ant.
If it does, the French player will have the most appropriate comment.
He was everywhere on the pitch, joining all the pass organizations, always taking responsibility and scoring a giant short-sighted show.
Alper's leading play left the Sturm Graz team "restricted" on the field for a long time to remain in the second lead position.
Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e was constantly looking for formulas to cross such a hard wall when he won the circuit without throwing a cornet.
They dominate the ball, but they don't produce effective rust in some kind of competitive penalty area.
This image may bring a "sentrfor need" comment, but we are facing a game that hesitates to match Ahmethan, and doesn't put the only centrfor in the position of the one in his hand.
Either the team doesn’t trust the young player or the performance needs to improve a little bit.
After the score was 1-1, they did not take advantage of two clear opportunities.
It was important for them to pass the tour, but to raise this side, which is applauding the players’ struggle, would make the night even more beautiful.
There are likely to be 1-2 new transfers by Monday.
But the truth is, Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e's greatest need is number 12...
We are on the brink of a very bright and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the heart of those in the forecourt.
Aykut Bocaman's machine is setting up the pot, he needs a little more time.
They are in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will also improve.
You can see very clearly that all the players on the field have increased their self-confidence.
They need a lot of applause last night for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
It’s just as you think 2017 can’t get any weirder than 2017, and a new report about technological advances in the sex robot industry is coming out.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Science Agency (FRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
We need to take their rise seriously, according to the retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and the founder of the FRR, Noel Sharkey.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, the shape of the nipple end and the type of nail.
Speaking about the release of the new report, Mr. Sharkey said: “People laugh at them a little bit, but companies actually like them a lot, and we’ll see more of them.”
Modern sex dolls evolved into robots with silicone skin, which is hot to touch from inflatable likes, especially human-like reactions carried out by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to fit their blood by choosing everything from eye color, tip shape, and nail type or color.
But since so many robots have "personalities" to innovate a Stepford Woman, it gets even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicone-based robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their own robots according to the character traits they find attractive (e.g. attractiveness).
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots, which were developed by True Companion, which came with pre-programmed personalities, giving the impression of "Frijit Farrah" and "adventurous" personality, including "Personal Wendy".
True Companion’s website says, “Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as uplifting to your personality as possible.”
So whatever you love, loves it, doesn’t love it, etc.
They also have moods during the day like the same real people.
He may be sleepy, willing to talk, or in “full mode.”
There are many disturbing aspects of the rise of sex robots: not only do they take the place of real human relationships, but their overly obedient female personality traits are the most thought-provoking of rapist calls as they approach Frijit Farah.
On the website, True Companion resembles Roxxxy as a vibrator but for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
These sex robots aren't just fetish or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality, which is an optional addition through bowing to the desire for sex.
Many men will naturally not have sex robots, and while FRR draws attention to their increasing popularity, they are now in the outer circles of the consumer culture.
But those who leak from the ends can be highly instructive about the course of the period in which we live.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be so.
It’s no coincidence that the White House has a president who prides himself on sexually assaulting women at a time when these sophisticated sex robots are under threat to women’s rights worldwide.
The scariest part of The Handmaid's Tale TV series is that it's not about pictures showing all the details, scientific bodies or engraved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
“The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn’t feel like such a big change at the moment.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible for real women as technologically possible (in proportions of porn movie stars, of course).
They want their creators to give a human feeling when they touch them and to imitate the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their “personalities,” robots clearly can’t represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They don’t have any activities or past stories, they don’t have anything that will expose their independence or spoil their total slavery fantasy.
In other words, they are the slaves who enjoy.
Or as of 2017: caries.
U.S. Military Convoy Attack: There Are Dead and Injured
In the suicide attack in the Afghan capital of Kabul, Karabakh province, foreign military forces operating in the country were targeted.
One NATO soldier and three civilians were also injured in the explosion, while five of the wounded were American soldiers in the convoy and one was an interpreter working with NATO forces.
The official statement by NATO support forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) said that NATO forces blew up a homemade bomber during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army.
Injured personnel were reported to be treated at Bagram Airport U.S. Military Hospital.
There is no life-threatening danger to the wounded.
According to local media, the suicide bomber was a Taliban manslaughter.
Trump's big deal?
Show Mitt Romney as a psychic
The micro-scale division of the political divide that polarizes U.S. voters has become the reality of the Trump era.
Newspapers in the U.S. around Christmas and Thanksgiving were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives voting for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our own filtration balloons.
What’s less talked about is Trump’s ability to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has a broken relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, who has been arguing over politics for decades with the formation of Trump in the White House, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is of course a good thing at the dinner table, but it seems to me that in a broad context it carries these significant risks.
The left was revived by Trump, but the twisting effect of his presidency created a right-wing force for all of us.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the horrific possibility that one day his strange behavior may no longer shock.
There is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump is “normalizing” right-wing Republicans who are against his own standards, and these suddenly seem to be a symbol of logic.
I find myself nostalgic about the strange version of Mitt Romney’s insanity these days: the dog on the roof of the car is a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which are actually very watery for Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee needs to be only at the forefront of his mind to assess whether he is providing an immeasurable degree of development.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the stables in Central Park, the largest of the stables operated by the New York Parks Department, and you don't need the caffeine or the best three dollars you can spend in the city.
The horses enormously large, centrally cylindrical fiberglass designs (all clowns and animals who made strange faces turned to look behind their shoulders with fear) and the music that swirls strangely narcotic.
In other words, many of the clichés of a city can be a disappointment: the views of tall buildings begin to get boring, the horizon begins to get familiar enough to not create too much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach the drop.
It’s been thirty-five years and I still can’t quite get past the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage isn’t actually a Swiss country house but (themed bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage) is a large rotating bunk in North London.
What's more, riding in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, so two people at two, one person at 11, and two women at 40, and they can all have a great time.
If I could give a note to the horseman, I would give him a full note, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to rate my "experience" of the transaction between 1 and 5 stars before I spent my credit card at a checkout this week.
The same goes for the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option of matching the note with a cup of 15%; for what you bought from the counter...
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be an unbiased purchase, but also to put pressure on the server to give personality to an event that is not at all needed.
As the poor woman on the bon march smirked as she stood apologizing, I gave her five stars to my experience of credit card-giving, in the midst of boredom.
When the temperature went up to 41 degrees, they wore mayoes.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season was lived, the people flowed to the beaches of Munzur.
The young, children, the elderly, women and men, who had been entering the beaches on the banks of Munzur Tea since the afternoon, tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling in ice-like waters.
The beaches on the edge of Munzur Tea were crowded, especially because Tunisian citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom spent their holidays in the Aegean or the Mediterranean instead of in their own countries.
Suna Tosun, one of the coolers on Munzur Beach, pointed out that Tunceli used her preference for holidays instead of western countries, saying, "I didn't want to spend my holidays in the west, it was better to cool down in the family in Munzur, it was better to stay on our own land."
"Munzur has no water like ice anywhere in the world, at these temperatures Munzur is cooling us," he said.
Hasan Ulu, who is from Germany, said they preferred Munzur Tea in Tunceli instead of the Cesme or Bodrum coasts and therefore did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is Pistorius' second time leaving the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts in his ankles, which he said occurred after falling into the cell of prison officials.
Pistorius was sentenced to death after the previous accident by prosecutors had been ordered to kill the man.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, Steenkamp was killed at his home in Pretoria by shooting several times at the door of a toilet.
Pistorius claimed to have confuse his girlfriend with someone who entered the cabin uninvited during the night.
Prosecutors have announced that they intend to appeal once again against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they consider to be too light this time.
The National Prosecution Service said it would appeal to the South African High Court and the objection could be assessed this year.
Pistorius, if prosecutors succeed, he will face a 15-year sentence.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first hurdle was successful.
With the organization of the Presidency of the Dianetics, the pilgrim candidates to go to Saudi Arabia succeeded in their prayers and tears at the Outbound Terminal of Ataturk Airport.
The ceremony, which took place before the movement of the first crucifixion staff, was attended by about 200 crucifixion candidates as well as citizens with their relatives.
Turkish Air Force (THY), on the other hand, distributed roses to the candidates of the crusaders who went to the sacred lands by chartered plane.
The Hajj tribe in Ankara succeeded from Esanbo<0xC4><0x9F>a.
In Kafile, for the first time this year, there were also martyrs and gas relatives who benefited from the application of the "unscrupulous crucifixion for gases and martyrs' loved ones."
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Camping
According to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, he was arrested in Greece on the grounds of two Bulgarian illegal camps.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of August 1.
They were dropped the same day while the investigation was already underway.
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened their controls on free-kamping, and are still cutting serious penalties on those caught while resting in undisclosed areas for that purpose.
He'll be checking throughout the season.
The department said the court could cut the sentence.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman, 22, went to Turkey to travel with two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who travelled Adana and Mersin by car, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
His friends, who came with him, informed his family in the Netherlands of Hoffman's inability to reach him despite all the searches.
While police were also on the move to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei went to Jaimy Gewald's Adana.
THE INSTITUTIONS ARE BASTIRIPED
Robin Hoffman, who applied to the police here, distributed the missing announcements in Adana and Mersin for his brother's search.
They received news from Robin Hoffman's brother on July 8, stating, "We first contacted the police in the Netherlands."
Then, together with my two friends, we came to Turkey and called the police here.
So far, we haven't received any news, and we haven't found any clues.
“We will stay in Turkey until we find my brother, until we get a message,” he said.
Congratulations to Prime Minister Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren
At the 2017 World Junior Swimming Championships in Russia, Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren became the second-largest national athlete in the world over 400 meters of water.
Minister of Youth and Sports Osman A<0xC5><0x9F>k<0xC4><0xB1>n Bak congratulated Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilba<0xC5><0x9F>, who won the silver medal with his message.
On the first day of the 2017 Pallet Swimming Youth World Championship in Russia, Ceren Green Basin became the second world over 400 meters of water.
While Ceren took his place on the second tier with his magnificent performance at the park where he competed with 8 finalists, he missed the gold medal with only 27 sallies.
While Elena Lopatina from Russia won the gold medal in the 400 metres with a degree of 03.18.73 minutes, Ceren became the owner of the silver medal with a degree of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by 8 men and 8 women athletes in the championship.
His last words were "I think I'm dying, goodbye mom."
Among those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London so far, calling their mother at the moment of the fire, "I don't want to die, Mom, that's not fair at all."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye," said Italian Gloria Trevisan and her lover.
Among the dozens of uninformed after the fire were Gloria Trevisan, 26, who sat on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, and her Italian girlfriend Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family living in northern Italy, said in a statement that, according to information obtained from the British authorities, the two young people had lost their lives.
The lawyer, insisting that the young people's families are experiencing a great deal of pain, also asked journalists not to insist on making a statement on the matter.
I think I'm dying, goodbye mom
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out and that she was crying when she listened to her last recorded conversations.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the 2 hours following the fire that started at around 1 a.m. local time.
"Mother, bad things are happening here, the fire is out," Trevisan said in his first speech.
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be saved.
“We tried to open the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator wasn’t working,” he said.
The last words of Gloria Trevisan, who became increasingly concerned about the growth of the fire in her next search, were:
Mom, my whole life is going through my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me, which is not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government.
Both Gloria Trevisan and her fiancé Marco Gottardi, who were educated in architecture, moved to London in March after graduating last year after being forced to find a job.
Gloria Trevisan, who was able to find a job at only 300 euros in her country, soon started working in London for a job of <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 a month (about 2,060).
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria Trevisan's family had a hard time financially, saying, "Gloria went to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find an immediate solution to this problem," he said.
Italy's drama that doesn't give young people a job
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his anger, saying, "This is the fault of our government, which forced our young people to flee abroad to find work."
In Italy, the unemployment rate is 12 percent, while the rate among young people is over 40 percent.
As this problem grew, over the past few years, many young Italians, including the UK, had begun to immigrate to many European countries.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110,000.
Commenting on the confirmation of the news of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi in the Italian press, it was also noted that this was the drama of a country that did not provide jobs for its young people.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can alleviate IBH
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This untreatable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the U.K., causes stomach cramps and swelling, repeated or bloody strokes, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein’s essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that build a stable gut.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the lead researcher, stated that immune cells patrol the intestines so that the microbes stored in food don’t enter the body secretly.
Cells that are capable of triggering infusion are balanced with cells that promote resistance by protecting sensitive tissues without harming them.
If the equilibrium climbs too far towards inflammation, the inflammation can result in intestinal disease.
In experiments, a type of immune cell emerged in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines that promotes resistance.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the emergence of cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between the bacterial species, which is part of the gut microbiome, and the development of the cell population that promotes resistance to Lactobacillus reuteri.”
Mice with more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells.
If the same thing happens in humans, L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diets can improve a more resilient, less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, while working on a type of immune cell that improves endurance, found that a group of experimental mice had these types of cells but that they were of the same type and that another group held in a different place did not have it.
The difference was suspected to be related to mice's gut microbiomes, in other words, to bacteria, viruses and fungal communities that live normally in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's guts were DNA-sequencing, and it was found that there were six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells, but in mice without them it was missing.
L. reuteri was given to mice who lacked a gut microbiome because they were looked at in a sterile environment and did not develop such an immune cell, and immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers increased L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred small amounts of this fluid, which is unbacterial, to immune cells taken from mice.
Immune cells have been transformed into cells that promote resilience.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s nutrients, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri developed in humans as in mice, but disorders in the genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
“This is something we probably want to encourage the development of these cells because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines,” he said.
In cases where L. reuteri is potentially present, high levels of tryptophan cause this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United will sign Nemanja Matic with a 'dinner'
The midfielder believes Jose Mourinho has signed a "tomorrow" with Nemanja Matic after his first match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The <0xC2><0xA3>40m transfer from Chelsea began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in the final pre-season game of United, with Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira aiming for a forward attacking position.
However, Matic, who was left out of the pre-season Asian tour by the Blues, had a serious lack of match-fixing and was only able to score 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this had to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
Mourinho said, "He needs water, but his experience, his intelligence, his genius in thinking... he thinks football."
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
As Mourinho began to form the first 11 for the season's head, like Matic, new transfer buddies Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku went on to play at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent has revealed that Mourinho still wants three more transfers this week but the club has already made three of its four priority transfers, insisting he has done "an extraordinary job".
"Thank you to the club for getting four of them," he added.
"If they get four out of four, I'd be happier, but they've put a lot of effort into me."
Last year, 197 people were hospitalized.
According to the Swedish Social Welfare Agency, in 2005 the rate of gender dissatisfaction per 100 people increased to 8 per 100 people in 2015.
A majority of 197 children and adolescents who were dissatisfied with their gender at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital last year were discharged.
Child psychiatrist Lousise Frisen, who works at the same hospital, said the increase could be due to the emergence of a more transparent society, “Transparency in the psycho-sexual field can be perceived as a general development in society, including issues of sexual identity.”
Sexual dissatisfaction is known to have nothing to do with sexual tendency.
Drug operation in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir
The paid District Security Directorate of the Bureau of Smuggling and Organized Crimes organized an operation at the home of the 36-year-old F.T. in Ülker Street on September 3.
In a search conducted at home, 33 ectacy pills were seized with a sensitive patch.
F.T., who jumped off the balcony and ran away, was arrested.
It was recorded that F.T. would be sent to the judiciary after his security operations.
Transfer to New Malatyaspor
Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor from the new teams of the Super League tied the wing player Turgut Do<0xC4><0x9F>an <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, wearing the Kas<0xC4><0xB1>mpa<0xC5><0x9F>a form last season.
According to a statement from the yellow-black club, a two-year contract was signed with the 29-year-old wingman as part of the transfer studies.
"In Kasimpa<0xC5><0x9F>a, a two-year deal has been made with wing player Turgut Do<0xC4><0x9F>an <0xC5><0x9E>ahin.
Good luck to our new Malatyaspor," the statement was used.
British inventor put on a microchip to get into his house and car with a hand gesture
A British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip to open his front door, access his office, and even operate his car with just one hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, moved between fingers with a tiny chip, and the service now offers jobs and people who want to make their lives easier with technology through his company BioTeq.
To ensure that the implant procedure can be applied to medical standards, Winchester went to work with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to the microchip applied to cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company will also make changes to the locks in homes and vehicles, including <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock to ensure chip compatibility.
This technology was installed in the home of the man, who is married and a father of a child, as well as in the BMW Z4, and his hands are running the car while he is in the steering wheel.
The White House's tax evasion has been done thousands of times.
According to military records disclosed to TIME, the decision to fly a Marine Corps helicopter to grass in the south for an organization that led the White House's American production last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president arrived, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of interest in the organization that introduced American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products produced in all 50 states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut was displayed alongside a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House Harp Department, the helicopter's presence is only 36 hours before landing for the "unusual" organization of the helicopter (also called FRAGO).
The commander of the HMX-1 sent an e-mail to the Deputy Commander of the Marine Corps, who is on top of the organization, writing, “I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high visibility organization.”
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn around 7 p.m. on July 17, and stay there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9.
He added that if the White House were to leave late, a second flight crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty time restrictions.
Some of the security personnel were standing inside while the aircraft was on the ground, while the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organization.
From the records provided to TIME, it is not clear whether a second flight crew is ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
The records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violates this condition.
The commander wrote, "One question we asked was whether he violated the Hatch Act and we were informed that he did not."
"You seem to be crowded," said the Deputy Commander.
The "Made in America" organization was designated as an official organization by the White House and does not fall under the Hatch Act.
But even the official organizations are political implications.
In the organization, the president emphasized efforts to reform the health services that then continued in the Senate and praised efforts to disrupt government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a very new phenomenon.
The presidents have to use them to travel.
However, it is unusual to formally request that these be used only for an opportunity to take a photo.
Trump had noted that the presidential jet went ahead behind the scenes of the first campaign meeting in Melbourne Florida in February and that his Twitter account was full of messages related to the use of the presidential jet.
A White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, said: “The White House is excited about the ‘Made in America’ exhibition where American workers from all 50 states produce American materials.”
The HMX-1 crew often conducts training flights in the Washington area and exercises to drop the US President to the White House in the south-east.
Trump made 58 drill landings at the HMX-1 White House in early July while in Germany for the G-20 summit.
An official said the flight, for the Made in America organization, was considered a training requirement for the air crew within that month.
Unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said the tax officials did not charge for any other number in the organization.
A spokesperson for Sikorksky said his firms did not agree to the setting for the helicopter to be displayed on the southern grasses.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact expenditure incurred by the organization.
But according to the Ministry of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the Ministry of Defense’s VH-3D rate is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft’s flight time as 30 minutes to both sides from the Marine Corps Air Facility at its headquarters base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual operating cost of the helicopter is far below this rate.
Walters said, "It's very misleading to tax makers to make an expense based on estimates of the rate of reimbursement."
"This rate includes estimates of incubation costs within personnel, maintenance and annual expenses."
According to a 2015 RAND survey, the Department of Defense’s costing ratios do not include personnel costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for this organization.
Spicer said, "It's an anathema to show what's being done in America this week."
“And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think hundreds of people are involved, even if not thousands.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans work tirelessly to do, like most Americans do.
So, of course, it is appropriate to highlight this.”
It’s not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he circled the southern grass for the organization, but he stepped into the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about the company’s products in his fleet to Sikorsky’s representatives.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well." He said, "I have three of them."

According to B.M., Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all sections of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, the vice president of the B.M. Aid Mission, says hundreds of women competed in the provincial council elections, three women competed for the vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
In a statement on Wednesday, she said, "Women's role cannot be overstated."
Elections only show women fully participating and can be truly representative and reliable if they are included in all parts of the election process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban has been threatening the election process, which has been turning into an advisory task for international military operations.
This year’s elections for the first time mark the peaceful revolution of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women will contribute to Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women have registered from 3.6 million registered voters.

GMB's concern over McVitie's investment in Glasgow factory
A union wants assurances from the executives of cookie maker McVitie's that a long-term commitment will be given to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross region.
In addition to other products, more than 500 people work in the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the region in the last few years.
He added that if there is a change in operations, employees and union representatives will be “first informed.”
In a letter to the company's facility manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "remove concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines is not available".
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: “The lack of clarity on the company’s business needs and Tollcross’s investment plan for the future deeply concerns our members.
Families have been working here for generations, and the workforce is concentrated in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, which are the critical base for adequate employment in an area with high unemployment.
Looking at jobs, wages, and well-being, Brexit conditions, rising surging costs, and chronic production declines, require an urgent four-headed mammal production presence at Glasgow’s east end McVitie’s.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Tollcross’s facility manager GMB received a letter from Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago where several issues were clearly discussed.
At that time, we told our employees, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, that we were constantly reviewing our operations in order to remain competitive for all of our jobs and facilities.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross facility, especially in production tapes and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of Tollcross’s legacy as a manufacturing facility, and in the event of any changes to our operations at the facility, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know.”
Necip and Utku in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> for another four years
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> Club extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for 4 years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), where the data on footballers were found, it was found that Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> extended the contract with two players until 31 May 2021.
Growing up in the black-and-white team infrastructure and making his first professional contract on June 19, 2008, Necip began to wear form in Team A in the 2009–10 season.
Born in 1991 to captain the team, he played in a total of 254 official matches in the form of Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>.
The TFF website also included information that Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> had signed a contract with him until 31 May 2021, receiving the bonus service of the keeper Utku Yuvakuran, whom Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> had hired last season.
The information on Utku's temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017, and the renewal of its license as of August 2, 2017, is available on the website.
Utku Yuvakuran played more than 21 matches in the Six League in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>, where he played last season.
The young goalkeeper took part in only 2 Turkish Cup matches in a black and white format.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s departure three years ago?
La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t give up following Neymar after offering a <0xC2><0xA3>189 million freeze, but did they warn Barcelona to drop the world record three years ago?
With the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record more than twice as much as Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million, the sensational offer moved the summer transfer period.
With PSG’s <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 weekly salary proposal after taxes, when the transfer is complete, it shows that Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and also the most profitable professional athlete in the world.
Although a source close to the Catalans' administration has insisted that since Santos' arrival in 2013 the club has always done its best to keep an eye on him, the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave are known to make Barcelona angry.
So, was the football world warned by the PSG president about this scene three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi gave a harsh warning to all clubs who wanted to sign one of PSG’s top players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're against them, we're in contact with their players."
"We respect all of the clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will bear the consequences.”
Spanish club Barcelona earlier this summer seems to have crossed this line by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG said they would not allow the Italian nationality to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona feels Neymar is losing the most of its values of this interest.

Six Europeans on Interpol's list of live bombs
The German newspaper Die Welt sent a list of 173 people named by Interpol (the International Police Agency) who had the potential to organize suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization DEA<0xC5><0x9E> last May to security agencies in European countries.
The 132 people on the list were reported to be from Iraq, North Africa, the Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six people on the list were said to be European citizens.
These people are said to have come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The German-linked person was reported to be a 27-year-old German citizen from the city of Solingen in North Rhine-Westphalia.
In the autumn of 2012, it was reported that the person went to Egypt, then to Turkey, and finally to Syria.
A statement from the DEASH in mid-July from social media accounts said the person had died in Rakka.
He was informed by the German Security Agency that the newspaper did not answer any questions about the matter.
The names on Interpol's list were claimed to have been captured in operations against the ISIL in Mosul.
According to The World, the U.S. intelligence agency sent this list to Interpol by reviewing it.
Interpol also recorded that the list was forwarded to police agencies in Europe in May.
Die Welt, based on information from German security circles, said that ISIS may be attempting to send some of the names on this list to Europe for the purpose of arranging suicide attacks.
The horrific success of the soldier with the pumped rifle: the 5-year-old star may lose his eye
There was bloodshed in the success of young soldiers in Job.
A crowd gathered in the park in the Karadolap neighborhood to make their friends go to the army the night before.
It is alleged that M.K. and the U.S.A. fired in the air from time to time with pumped guns inside the group.
After the success of the troops, the group began to disintegrate.
M.K. fired a hand at the ground with a pump gun as he passed the playground full of children.
One in five children sitting on the park bench were injured due to dirt from the ground.
It was reflected in the park's security cameras.
Injured persons Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Deder Balk<0xC4><0xB1>r, Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>zsu Unus, Pearl Rock ambulances were taken to nearby hospitals.
The five-year-old star Unus, who was undergoing treatment at the hospital, was at risk of losing his left eye.
The star's mother, Mary Rock, told DHA about those moments.
When he was in the arms of his granddaughter, Rock said that the event took place, "The soldier's celebration began at 8:00."
It took two hours.
The soldier's fun is over.
The young people began to disintegrate.
When it was over, it was our turn to get up.
The gun exploded right in front of me.
My grandson's not well.
He has an 80-90 percent chance of losing his eye.
We talked to the doctor, he said.
They took out one of the fools and the other in his eye.
"He's had one surgery, maybe 10 surgeries," he said.
The suspect M.K. and <0xC3><0x96>.A. were arrested by the Asayi<0xC5><0x9F> Bureau Amir<0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F> teams of the Eyup County Security Directorate.
