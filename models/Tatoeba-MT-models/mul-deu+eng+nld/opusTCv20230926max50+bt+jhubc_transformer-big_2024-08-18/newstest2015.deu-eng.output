Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-Old After Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signs and continued on Burgess Road before heading into the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police are accusing a 20-year-old man of not following a stop sign and reckless driving.
He is due to appear in court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster Accused of Hotel Rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was heard at a hearing in Glasgow by the Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, slept, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Consideration of the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as civil rights.
“Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Employee Entitlement Act together with civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of union organization as it does for other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the national labour law law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation in order to appeal to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks to which trade unions have been exposed in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend, and enforce labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to unify in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their trade unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the workers' rights to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly stating: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is always guaranteed and improved.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to narrow it down are null and void; measures to do so are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other writers added to his right to join them.
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country was advising other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union – and to allow this union to participate in collective bargaining as equal partners with companies and government agencies – should be protected.
After these rights have come under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to re-emerge the American ideal, so that the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and elevated the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - have long been overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say would likely have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, enacted by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and set to enter into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to have patients admitted to a hospital within a 30-mile radius to acquire their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform abortions legally while applying for such a right.
“The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they strive to obtain these rights,” Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing will be held for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, and said doctors were giving so much more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana are running away from a bill that wants to take away their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has filed a lawsuit on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, who did not join the lawsuit and had also applied for inquiries.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state’s remaining clinics to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that the right of admission of doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion disagree with the fact that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient IDs, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to no longer perform abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient identification rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video tribute to her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the women’s medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases, as well as social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counteract distances, as a possible remedy, it proposed strengthening the service of in-flight doctors to enable specialists to provide women with closer care at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographic status, showed a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining number of homeowners
The decline along with a sharpened decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “corner age group for garden products” according to a study by the HTA, reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that renters spend on average 55 percent of the amount people with their own homes spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting prefabricated gardens for park purposes, and the decreasing garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion per year is converted into sales.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that renting homes or small gardens doesn’t mean people can’t pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for RHS, said: “Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them during a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to increasing numbers of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improvement in the market situation for this year due to better weather due to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters stormed the state-run PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but now transmits again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they engaged in clashes with security forces equipped with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country's army, meanwhile, calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using force".
After a meeting at Headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already smashed more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in last May’s parliamentary election.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to come to Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey Appoints U.S. Diplomat for Espionage Report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has hired the country’s most senior U.S. diplomats to report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. Embassy's business spokesman and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that those by the former U.S. analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major activity area for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were espionage of each other.
An earlier report that Germany’s most important intelligence service, Ankara, was also targeted, caused by the Turkish government to react much more irritatingly.
Warning strike: locomotives threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by the locomotive drivers on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stoppage announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. covers all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and subway transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is the freight traffic.

said Sven Schmitte, the district chairman of the trade union of German locomotive leaders (GDL), in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant outages.
There are no regional priorities.
The main focus of the warning strike was on freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW has announced that it will do everything in its power to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wants to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences.
Magaluf's Chief of Police Charged with Corruption
On Friday, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to Mallorca’s public prosecutor’s office.
Calvi<0xC3><0xA0>’s chief of police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bartenders at the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested on corruption charges by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the Attorney General for Combating Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being interrogated together with Navarro by a judge.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angered nightclub owners stated that the authorities’ vetting economy had a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about survival,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist carrying 24 men during a safari tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the misconduct of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fallatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage jointly have to pay a penalty of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, popular especially with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
The FRÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with fierce thunderstorms and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 pm, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen on Sunday night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy thunderstorms, including a thunderstorm that started just before 8pm and caused nearly 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell again to a peak of just 15.8<0xC2><0xB0>C on Monday.
The buoyant weather conditions probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a scissor wind – a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance – and had to restart.
At this point, wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off on a second landing and finally set off at about 20.40.
The flight delay subsequently led to the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
The maximum temperature in Adelaide on Tuesday is predicted to be 16<0xC2><0xB0>C, with possible thunderstorms.
Matthies says it’s high time for big networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our cozy home into high-tech switchgear, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this here, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there’s a reason behind it: If the cable wasn’t there, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be significantly more retro.
In any case, it applies to the eclectronic (eclectronic?
No, typing error: electronic) Sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And who, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, simply says that he basically refuses television.
Why these reflections?
Because the insistence of the Ifa at the Funkturm this week again leads us to our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who once blindly mastered the washing machine and CD player, does not even understand today the purpose of the devices, which are spread with incredibly simple expert speech in front of him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quarks?
Basically, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we should like to network our house.
So that the yogurt itself reorders, so that the fire detector informs us on holiday in the Maldives that it burns gradually in the working room.
And wouldn’t it be wonderful if we left the office from the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, this requires an air conditioning system.
But a dream will come true very soon: we raise our watch, you say, "Suck!" - and the vacuum cleaner goes home.
Wrong.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods disappear", a industry expert says, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, but the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses shows us how long the pizza is still in the oven.
We also know from everyday practice that if a non-mode device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli Children Return to Schools After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air defenses, while rocket and mortar shelling on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, he settled down and stayed in schools in Gaza.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel drawn by rocket launch holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, were removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re excited,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt “a little weird” to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a Gaza border city heavily fired by the Palestinians.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on Tuesday to a ceasefire indefinitely.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand for an abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities last week shifted the start of the school year.
“I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl calls into question NPD ban proceedings
In the face of the NPD’s loss of votes in Saxony, CDU-federal vice president Thomas Strobl has decided to end the ongoing NPD-prohibition process before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU vice-president Thomas Strobl, the ongoing banning proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
“The NPD is cutting off worse than last time,” Strobl, who is also the head of the CDU in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that we are fighting the NPD politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had almost failed at the five-percent hurdle in Sunday’s vote.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at the time also had informants at the top of the NPD.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
At the Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting out of all the seams.
Now, the interior authorities have set up three tents of the Red Cross next to them.
The district politicians were informed just in advance - they are not enthusiastic.
“These Hauruck actions continue to push back reservations from citizens and do not give district politicians the opportunity to constructively contribute to the humane housing of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, Greens’ Group Chairperson in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the district administration of Harburg provide unused houses for accommodation at the moment.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough seats in the secondary facilities.
As a result, many refugees stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest increase in winter in seven years, according to a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homeowners in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
Due to this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is at 4.2%, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s head of research, Tim Lawless, said that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a bipartisan market.
The figures from RP Data show that home prices in Sydney rose 16.1 percent last year, compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices have risen by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by just 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that with the start of spring, there would now be an increase in properties for sale for the next few months, which would put the market to “a real test.”
“Given the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate, and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further over the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and certifies him to pose "like a field master".
The style of the university is not this, it says in the statement.
Thus, the Medau family was already "orally informed about the opinion of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong,” Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not “prefixes or even decisions”, but there would be “preferences”.
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle necessary for access was also less dramatic than the Medusa feared.
It was and is not a nine-metre wide street.
According to the current level, it goes by 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
There is no parking at all, because as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking of the residents
The children's cradle of Bergwichtel, which is on the grounds and would lead to access to the deck of the park in front of its door, is said to be "not impaired".
Rather, it should be remembered that "this is not only about the children's crib, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
So it’s much more than the particular interests of the Medau gentlemen,” said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the child's parental advice, with the expansion of the street would be justified by one of Coburg's "several naturalized spots to be lost" "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Construction Office Bamberg, will inform the city councils about the building development of the university until 2020 "and in this context will address the importance of the new development".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the children’s crib about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access for the new parking deck should not be via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but via the Medau-Berg.
In order to do this, the narrow road would have to be expanded to a length of about one kilometre in two tracks.
According to calculations of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
From the side of the city, we did not want to comment on the project until now.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems for this decision.
I did not like the decision easily, it has matured over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
He thus goes into international retirement with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go on goal hunting for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me as much as they will thrill my long-time co-players and my followers.
But for my club, I want to be available healthy in the coming years, it takes longer regeneration breaks, which does not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear the end of his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortison syringe, which later had triggered a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had filed a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go by no body without a trace.
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
There are also some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I can control my head, but I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time magazine.
For a comeback, he would only be available in an absolute emergency.
"When all the knitting breaks, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) EHF Cup.
In 2012, he also won the European Cup of Cup Winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrinks by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from the previous quarter from April to the end of June 2014.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economic downturn.
Thanks to the strong year-on-year increase, GDP in the first half of 2013 is a total increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The castle town of Horstmar experienced an invasion on Sunday by Dutch "fietzen drivers".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland with their registration.
Printed in various journals, this tour has been offered to interested parties.
We come from Den Helder and we drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way as well,” the cyclists rejoiced about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering in the clubhouse of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the start was also made.
Furthermore, the route, which was awarded for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," concludes Heinz Lölfing.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped,which was probably due to poor weather forecasts and morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on 30 August or another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought to paper Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, police activist, ex-prisoner, in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought fetishes for thought fetishes, the Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable songtext.
And he’s ruthlessly honest: From onania as a gymnast to shoplifting and drug use, he doesn’t let go of human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes on abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the Now, spirituality – all this he tries to go on in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his critique of society, his political commitment – and also how not only the music influenced him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is "created by subtraction", as he says, "while neglecting all unnecessary things".
Between all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about beatings in a local frequented by GI’s or a crazy drive where he faced a tree frontally.
He is also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Stop the crash.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – who had grown up when I was a child – went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I've never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than his father's, he gained an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It’s a bit brighter now, but they’re dark, smoky, deep slumped labyrinths with flames and smoke and plenty of rust.
My father used to just put himself in the bathtub and then he could be heard slowly as he started to sing because he was able to wash the casting from himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to put the food on the table, and my respect for him grew greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimonies.
My father never hugged me, he never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother got sick at the end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me! Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with a Frenchman with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been taken from the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Illusions, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedy on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to not only grow up in front of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I somehow wish it had never happened, but I don’t regret that I did.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-old award-winning light column of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
By introducing figures that mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just wasting time or getting a little bit in the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and mostly held him for a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose, and a cabbage head in front of him.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don’t do it badly if you don’t know what you’re talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry made 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on.
“That’s what it’s about, it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
All of a sudden I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical flaw and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, 'You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they're repairing the computer.'
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This too came about well, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERING voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is filled with humorous outbursts while he keeps imitating people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant gratification from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always look for it, you’re driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don’t have as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey – I don’t think I want to ever give up on that again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthi have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic jam in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday night.
Huthi threatened, according to the newspaper, with a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shia Huthi are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Huthi people have been occupying the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
There are bloody battles with the Yemeni army in the surrounding area.
Kenya Registers Officials to Shut Down 'Ghost Employees'
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove “spirit employees” from the government’s payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salaries even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised at his 2013 inauguration to fight corruption in the public service.
A review earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost in payments for “spirit employees” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri told the BBC in the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers in the next two weeks to ensure that their biometric records are recorded, a government report said.
Anyone who would not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the statement continued.
"This approach will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'spirit employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the plan center and secretary of cabinet for the Secretary of State.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings in civil proceedings at the Düsseldorf Landgericht.
This was reported by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and oldtimers and calculated Berthold Albrecht’s purchase prices higher than the actual price paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings.
He served 44 years in the school ministry, of which 23 were headmasters.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many professed Petershauseners and Kollbachers from their time as a pupil.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his quest to see people in the pupil.
The snow cap is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were sacked.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So the judge flew into the Upper Franconian village of Senken.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the next station, drive by train to Bamberg, where three kilometers across the city to go to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954, after three years of teaching, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken did not have a teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss-Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he rented a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 they were put together in Petershausen in the present town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a recession in the now smaller school, then-rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to use the current construction from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the municipality, had an additional workshop and during the 1997 expansion of the basement rooms, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a school council speech on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two ways: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to find out, "It doesn't always work out." Whether he means his pupils or his own six children, it's not clear.
In any case, Richter's deed was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils beat themselves up, they did not get a penal job from him and were also not sedated to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, the judge had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and allowed the two opponents to stand against each other, even if there should be a veil.
For the good of the school, Judge maintained a good relationship as rector with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partyless judge after his retirement to run at least last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Richter was pre-elected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists put in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, that is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of resting ones alone made the impression: The 700 participants of the hr4-cycle tour including accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Raddle and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and there was a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen own business, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All sorts of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: the landlady from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, zwitschen-, streusel- and cheesecakes, which were wonderful for the skilled cyclists.
“Such cakes can only be baked by landlady,” said a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
At the drinking stand of the Geiss-Nidda gymnastics club cold refreshments could be created.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and garnered enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He has earned it, finally he has reassembled bicycle chains that have already been dropped today".
In the meantime, the mayor and the company manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of reporter Rainer Janke’s drinking spa and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Promotional manager Tobias Hagen, who has been a tour leader since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, was also able to sniff for a short while, although he had plenty to do with the technology on-site.
His pick-up truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-headed motorcycle staff of the Hesse Police via three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they stopped again after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and, of course, there was prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as a member of the Board of ADAC Hesse-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to swing in the open air has been eagerly used on the bike, despite the sporty activity.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens who were just as impressed by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trench Woods - were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'conspiracy' against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies reported.
The police did not give any direct comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla Gülen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yazenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, head of the school in Slavyansk, which visits Jazenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the next life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud smuggler from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own frontier experience.
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., where she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson’s parent company’s senior position went to a younger male colleague.
Their settlement was reportedly almost <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political rankings are solid, too.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
As early as May, I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned glass.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: inwards on the first guard of one’s own management hierarchy at the BBC, but also outwards as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopoly that calls for a complete and comprehensive reform.
But which new president would risk taking over, smashing everything, and dismantling an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself in the process.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC shrink – power, money and status outdated.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys into the world’s certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
Watching and using habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she's found him.
Perry from Texas says defamatory tweet was not authorized
A tweet from Texas Republican governor Rick Perry’s official user account on Sunday contained a remark about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another from Perry's user account, which discarded the previous one.
Just sent a tweet from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I didn’t approve of the tweet and deleted it,” the tweet read.
Perry's staff did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets came from Perry’s official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial backing of her office when she refused to resign, leading to a lawsuit against Perry — who might be a 2016 presidential candidate — ahead of a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet reads, “I don’t always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I complain to Governor Perry if he explains it.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg’s office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury’s investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio special prosecutor who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His high-profile team of right-handers applied to the judge entrusted with the case to dismiss the charge and argued that the law dealing with the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds to the state’s Public Integrity Unit – which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas – when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto resulted in a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa assembly elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words “South Carolina, we’re coming!”
Berkeley declares housing market "normal"
One of London’s most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England is “returning to normal” levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly coveted and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013,” adding that this offered a “stable environment of action.”
The London real estate market was well positioned during the recession as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Cataster Office, prices in the urban area alone have risen by 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average sales prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable, and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and stood at <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric by a possible “village tax” ahead of the upcoming May elections.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which sharper lending regulations were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgages in July, which also suggests that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter year-over-year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the due amounts for future sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right well-planned product in the best locations remained stable and as a result, the sales on the market remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April – almost a third more than at its 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, while revenues rose by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said revenues for Berkeley in the current year would be expected to match current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley stocks were fixed at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performing at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and sued the hacker for "blatant violations of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will be following all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan, were allegedly acquired by a gap in Apple's online storage system iCloud. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashians, Mary Elizabeth Winstead.
It’s not clear how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star from “Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you're so happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolode series "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, disputed that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are LOVED, people.
Let’s start with the beginning. *Wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They split, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolve like a cardboard that you have left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distanced, and maybe a bit scratchy.
And then shake his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was sluggish, like an Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stalemate was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relieving of the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a shiveringly tender beauty with undressed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and harsh than Port Reuben.
She had come with an older accompaniment to the south, who held the caverns for her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradisiacal valley named Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, the bathrooms were still spiders, the naked snails had left their traces on all the windows and believed all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a childhood fairy tale, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding his hand on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of whom had clung to the service console with a mindless voice, which gave the country its horny whistles to him with calming music and suffocating messages.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so rightly banned - simply not played.
It has been successfully obsolescenced, as has the word obsolescence.
The general taste worked out what decrees and regulations had never worked, and how people chose the memoirs, cookbooks, and love novels in books, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Cavern started playing an imaginary piano and chopping Ailinn's big feet in a coarse-comic serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny now.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of one.
Jazz, although not directly forbidden, was not played.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So is the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressive mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Cavern knew something about jazz from his father’s half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society was gratefully in agreement with the principle of group giving – gratefully as those saved from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited for entertainment and sport by temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family was left without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks destroyed Teller.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as what they had forgotten, when it had happened, out of fear of being accused of firefighting, even out of fear that the flames would be devoured by him, and he would have devoured them as the next.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that the caverns had just presented to her could ever be uttered.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
Anyway, she thought he was something special.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head unbelievably and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing else to be seen in the whole world but your uncombed ragged black hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see otherwise.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're proposing it to me.
She seemed to be genuinely concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked at me again.
Don't get your feet straight.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn’t have the soothing charm needed to embrace the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kevern.
In spite of his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deckchair, flipped the console, and poured the wine they had drunk.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkenness was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like a palm tree in the storm.
“And your dickhead is exactly the reason I feel perversely attracted to you,” she said.
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary rudeness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She hadn’t told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the way it was here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke down here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and sadder after what had happened to them than their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, always moved from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or denied them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she hadn't been careful!
They just knuckle - knuckle was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspeakable love ballads from the console - they just knuckle and then beat.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the knitting itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He stood up from his chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the power of his grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She looked at him as he was walking away—as if from a room on the upper floor her companion was watching him—a man, complaining about something he himself had vowed to do.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon’s feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, was engaged in a short lecture on the continued violence of this country, if he was not in the lower and middle level, he was in charge of energy.
"A lot has already been done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "to avert the innate aggression of a people who has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has been seen to be sour in the past.
But some properties prove to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The population weeps when it hears sentimental ballads, gets drunk with stories about overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless, not only does the former cruelty keep the rural communities on the streets and the locals on the streets as well as ours on the streets, there is firmness in the hands of the city.
“They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said as he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and refusal to make a statement.
Feminist?
Quiet again.
“I don’t ask that,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-prejudice workplace.
We serve a non-prejudice society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call “behind” and “rough” could as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to revolve around what is lost when it is lost, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the country’s essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or longer.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want out of," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice, as she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we are ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that only led to what was lost when it was lost at all.
This time, however, it is not the others to let go of our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to show patience in English.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you talk about letting go of your “wow” and your “distrust” in “others.”
It should not actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “others”.
There was no “we” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
“From who, if we are honest with ourselves,” Esme dared to argue, “no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it has been done wrong or good, what has happened has happened.
That was at the time.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be attributed, no guilt has to be erased if such a reparation would be appropriate and if there was a way to forgive it.
But what is the use of the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If there's anything I can say about it -
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramids collapsed.
"I will remember her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overtaken by a motorcycle driver who, as passers-by described, was riding on the road in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister stays in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho disputed that they planned a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said it was proceeding against policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the country's army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after he reported threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup d'état, but that the military was responding to the threat by "political fanatics" whose weapons were being carried out by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements were acting within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were just before them," he said, citing Scha.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action made the impression of a coup.
“Even if no one has claimed to have smashed the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho’s defence forces so far show signs of a coup d’état,” he said.
Spokespersons for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become the target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been major tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the disputes in his unity government.
He said his actions would not have unterminated the government, otherwise sound accusations despite.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro area slowed to its lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Producing Industry Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakthroughs in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will appear before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant eurozone recovery and for the impending deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the ECB’s head, Mario Draghi, could make further indications over the course of this week whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for manufacturers have become more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economic nation of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worrying child, as is the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer apply are also not reassuring," Mr. Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
The positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say about the August Eurozone Producing Industry Procurement Manager Index is that the sector continues to grow after that.”
“Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy – in particular, and consumer confidence – and are likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to introduce some kind of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entwined in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death at the horror scene in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the devastating siege of Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future amidst the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your biggest hope?
That the war that Ukraine is now haunting – and in the children like them are dying – is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back to the school sports hall
She was photographed by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famously tried to climb back into the school sports hall in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
They were both considered dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said at the time.
My legs were flooded with blood.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she felt completely healed, but said yesterday: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have surgery again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Your goal is now to become a dentist to help people like you have been helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says.
“This has happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember the ones who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of her, even though the memory gets a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself coming back to school online, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help make sure that something like this doesn’t happen again.
The boy who ran through the ball hammer, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, “Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.”
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Frightened that she might be dead, he ran away and saw a crying little boy on the way, grabbed it in his hand and fled through a ball of hammer.
His father, Vladimir, who locked his son in the arms outside, said, “Damir told me his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara had stumbled outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, “I was crying for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now-dissolved News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of a Bernardo's Children's Champion from then-Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror is chasing you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that it gets flashy in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and who didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could pick everything I wanted, and the ride in a top open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars are causing the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, “37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borshchch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot her with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I always think this world hasn’t gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war is going on now, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just kids like ours.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that’s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember lying on the couch sometimes, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17 years older than me, looking good, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and looked at the hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
“I remember yelling at him, ‘Damir, run, run, run away,’ but I was also so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life goes on, unlike that of many others, for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became a symbol of the horror of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodthirsty face was drawn by fear as he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed to take her older son, Vladimir, to university.
“I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days,” she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my georgy was able to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days haunt me forever.
No one will ever forget it, I promise.
The image of Georgiy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgi in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
George says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
“I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People re-examine such tragedies over and over again and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is going to be terrible.
“I can’t understand how that’s possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
Later in 2004, I went back to school and was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym when September 1st gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't condone it.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical college in Vladicawkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sitting next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly a miracle that he was not killed.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” says Georgi, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I’m older now and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 – the year after – was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I've lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB’s Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it, and of course they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse as the anniversary draws nearer.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Georgy won't go.
It must be a lot tougher for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited at home for him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan are all of them signed.
It stays in us.
George is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept that when something like this happens to someone unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can run, but does not run a sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that only increased my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby that was so grippingly carried in safety by a special deployment command
Rescued: Aljona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school gymnasium in their cruelty.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous butchery.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, which he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of overtaking girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is being tried for driving a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of attacking a girl at the crossing in Pittenween, East Neuk.
The indictment says Mr. Steward drove his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, pleads the charges before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC commenced the trial in January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3<0x2B> Silver Edition, both of which are worth about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders feature scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is capable of working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to watch it underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that allows you to take a series of shots with slightly altered exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you remove yourself from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor light conditions.
It’s especially important when you’re working with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you’ll need to get closer to your objects if they’re to fill the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to saving the patient both the agony of the disease and the pains of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the treated are mostly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time catching up.
While struggling with flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do it sooner than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusual and anxious for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been to the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the X-ray examination was presented.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the skin of the chest, that is, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers before.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "wonder material" but has since been identified as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the material – clampers, construction workers, housekeepers and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from a different time, it hardly seems to be of concern today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the height of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999, all asbestos types were banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the hostage of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn, and the shops where we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a safe haven.
Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healed, we have already become the starting point for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and nurses - use the tunnel.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to at least partially answer this question.
“Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy’s Hospital and who have been sick with mesothelioma for the past five years,” he wrote in a 2010 letter, “I am the last one still alive.”
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still get sick?”
The UK’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to erupt, a total of 90,000 will fall victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die like this.

A brief glimpse of the records of the courts, to which the victims often turn for damages claims, shows how widespread the scourge of the mesothelioma is already.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children in her twenties.
“Before this,” she says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn’t even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that it would affect me.
There are very few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It has been used for roofing plates, flooring plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for braking linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a “large health risk” with a possible death consequence.
However, more dangerous are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolith).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He submitted a study of those affected, stating that "a substantial proportion of the mesotheliomas without known exposure were probably caused by work or at home due to asbestos contact in the environment."
Much of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be woven by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of this House are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the direction of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of western labor must be spent over several years in order to renovate the Parliament, reconstruct the power plants, and remove all the asbestos in 2015.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost you your life.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbot suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos cases were positively resolved," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked in and the data.
What he still remembers is the day early December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45 years old and had an operation late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible. I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home any more.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs, was coming.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-rays of his chest and inserted pleuracatheters to remove fluid from his lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after athletic activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient Abbotts came into his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott has nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his GP brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and chest skin.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
Honestly, I wasn't worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
It was not until now that he understood the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos,” he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
He is still being removed today.
Students placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Because of its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties, asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
Asbestos in schools is now frequently discussed on websites.
And in the meantime, such innocent items in our houses as floor slabs or shed roofs have included asbestos as standard.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s contained in large parts of our property,” notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how to slit your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I noticed that I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients in front of him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very hard to take it all up,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
That was then."
Mesothelioma is particularly mysterious because it is our life-sustaining mechanism – the breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can attach to the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
The treasure denies it.
"You can't cut out the breast," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer speaks "not very well on chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not cure.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counseling office for co-affected individuals.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he said cheerfully when he called.
"He was very positive," Abbott said.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be forwarded, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a transfer and wait for treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments inevitably fail, many affected are faced with another financial concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that they realized that even a very low load posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full compensation," as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, however, a spokesman for the guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients who seek compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute the lethal asbestos contact of a company or a workplace — usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there have been significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma-affected people to sue for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012 to be able to prove contact, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal redress process could have owed them – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” of the insurance industry.
“This is a deal from insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if time hadn’t gone by and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, given seven deaths a day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At the time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40%.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“Of course, that’s the most important thing,” Abbott says.
We see this again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you will get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No more traces of the tumors are visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things – about the money when I’m no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler line setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not get old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unpretentious.
She told it to her friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China Denies Hong Kong Right to Government Election, Protesters Swear Retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament, despite increasing calls for democratic reforms, decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This move likely fuels the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization to do so within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress allows Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-Beijing loyal candidates.
“It doesn’t come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry,” said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party’s chairman.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow residents to elect the government chairmanship from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for Hong Kong’s citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process by a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong’s biggest and most public-influenced protests have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shoot down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s government headquarters within hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should take place only when all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and security measures, including police and barricades, were tightened in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is heightened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement as they jeopardized business operations – the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
“The protests they are talking about could do great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to push fears that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the right to vote, in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the United States is now being transferred to the universities where freshmen performances are offered by private jet.
We look forward to being able to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
To achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to crawl their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that “students would book the service in the coming weeks.”
The company also announced that it expects a market for this offer despite the tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year.
Today’s students are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as being cancelled.
Megan Dunn, NUS Vice President for Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are exposed to a crisis of cost of living, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep up with the rapidly rising bills for the simplest basics of living before they can even think about the thousands of pounds in the student’s pockets for something like that.
Feminists Criticize Race Issue and Police Behavior for Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as tensions in the Midwest increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women revolved around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts on Ferguson by a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in feminism who talk about whiteness and privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
The people felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically shaped that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems to which black Americans are exposed every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny about me and my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
“How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating themes cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the motive was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women campaigners for women’s suffrage such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for suffrage could only be successful for one group each: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to stand up for women’s right to vote, and the right to vote for blacks should come later,” Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one becomes aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn’t do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catches" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to birth control?"
Second-generation feminists, who build their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, are now trying to understand what this means.
Famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a body-intrinsic danger — and opinions about the race that are clearly different in public surveys — will lead to the changes,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which race as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on race in America are still astonishing.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks to argue against Ferguson.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently put in place a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were outrageous reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community isn’t the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors were picked up by U.S. border police at the country’s southwestern border this year, the theme of immigration reform is coming to the surface again – this time as a women’s theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a key women's theme, it should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a recession in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Swine house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had bedded his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner.
"However, the photo was erroneously published and has now been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the House Exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-bedroom single-family house."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lotto player from Harvey is out this month.
The search for a new millionaire in Southwest Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot for the second time in five years in the first division draw, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to register.
Store owner Steve Forward said the gain provides conversational material in the small town southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought there might be such a profit.
Eight WA winners celebrated wins in the first division last month, a decent finish for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont just weeks earlier achieved a mega-win of $7.5 million.
The winning pair had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas Bat in the Gladiator Arena
It wasn’t just the gladiators who were in the mood for the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who resisted the rain and the autumnal cold and were restlessly impressed by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of depictions, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men in succession to the ring for heroic duel in various gladiator engagements.
First, the "provocateurs" were in line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and slingshot as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who started against the "Secutor" with throw net, Dreizack and Dolch and after a short fight hit the boys to the ground.
Then the swords metallized together, the shields created, and the worms flew surreptitiously through the arena that could become a fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrator, had an always attentive eye on it.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era liveable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends Circle Roman Canal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for a day, a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region, but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also to be admired during the Roman day, for example "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman canal bridge, which then stood at Lüfttelberg.
The Frontinus society faced water and energy once and now, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of then".
This is also confirmed by graduate measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating that once heated the Römervilla.
Impressive also the footprints that were left in the footsteps of Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago made of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landmark Care Office of the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building with a dam for drying grain and milling have been found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations were presented in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of an ornamental necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the German invasion of the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
At her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on waxboards, as the Roman students used to.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics and at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flat bread or a müsli.
With the original Roman trolley drawn by two cold-blossoms, visitors drove through the amusement park, passing the impressive state-of-the-art urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter into the Rhine-wide Roman Year 2014, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes will be offered and will remind you of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary tells of his work on the right watchtower, presents plants as living monuments from Roman times, and presents a funny lesson in matters of international understanding between a group of Watchtower "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Elementary School is dedicated to the Roman theme within a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be re-experienced.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are stalled – and international companies go far.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are lagging behind - the virus has hardly added to the region.
A number of international companies have also gone too far.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease had progressed in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, thousands more have died.
Foreign companies are withdrawing employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies suspend their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: Only a few merchants are leaving their homes to provide supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Foods are scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
Therefore, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food shortages.
In the markets, stocks of basic foods such as rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk is that international companies will basically avoid the area over a long period of time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
Determine how far and for how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that “it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore invest,” warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the burden of the state’s hard-pressed households
The disease also burdens the state households of the affected states, which are still suffering.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily burdened by the high spending on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region of the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people already stay at home for fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels are also declining.
Protectors Celebrate Their 50th Anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau Protective Association celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding party are running from 12 to 14 September.
It is scheduled for Friday, September 12th, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 6 p.m., there is a big bullfighting.
Then, in the large festive tent, there is the evening of mood with the "Stoopfälzer Spitzbaum".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the large fortification at 2 pm.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their Dirndln.
The festive chapel is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association for "social entertainment through exercise in room-studded and small-caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the club in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men met again, who on 30 April in the inn Lukas had lifted the "new" protector's club "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult initial period in which it was mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club’s records were broken every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, so have the membership numbers developed positively.
After the club premises "Leininger" no longer satisfies the demands of a modern protector's club, the then management, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2,700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, parish priest Strasser gave the church a blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gaussian shooting, associated with the solemn dedication of the new patronage flag in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a brewer group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became a tax reporter.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, last year the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof and thus brought to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sports performances of the Schützenverein.
A total of 11 teams currently participate in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth team and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose from the Gauoberliga (highest league in Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml have risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as bockstechen, faschings- and kingsball, club trip and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
The patrons are also present at the feasts in parish and community.
Tony Stewart Suffers Accident on Return to Racecourse
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre crashed into round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can make it better there.
Stewart had already driven into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I came in today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an ashtray race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had taken to the highway during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities said on Friday that the investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart should be charged.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start to 12th position, Stewart was in the top 10 shortly thereafter and temporarily placed fourth.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs
Cars with No. 18 out of control after exiting curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Dance-loving young people wanted
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and leader Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to co-wrestlers.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn are also creating full-day classes at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have greatly decimated themselves.
Now, more and more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
“Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds,” says the 20-year-old.
With more active, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
Those wishing to dance can snuggle into the training hours on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6:30 pm in the dance gym at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
“The training starts with a warm-up program on a regular basis,” says the trainer.
Thereafter, various choreographies are performed.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
“We also go out to eat, watch dance movies and we’ve already stayed in the dance room,” says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If jazz dance is not so, you can also sneak into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always sneak into the classes on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video-clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who like Discofox, Slow Walzer, Viennese Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can visit and join.
Bulgarian Prison Supervisors Protest Across the Country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, the Director General for the Implementation of Criminal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has given up airport of Luhansk
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army abandoned the Luhansk Rebel High Castle airport on Monday.
At the same time, the army said that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously withdrawn personnel consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shoot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have shot down a fighter jet and two military helicopters, according to their own description.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the rebels said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Ships of the Coast Guard sunk
The rebels also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian coast guard for the first time in the Azeri Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been shot down on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the radio station 112.ua.
Two crew members were deemed missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk region under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also take part.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to make public their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of “a skewed breach” of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show that "they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO Presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A “readiness action plan” to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have a more visible NATO presence in the east as long as necessary,” Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute, according to official information.
The talks are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks as well.
Due to the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off its gas supply to Europe.
Europe extracts about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says power word: Maut will come "very clear"
The Chancellor is now making this clear again.
However, it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU has raised persistent concerns from the CDU against the toll on cars.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll after persistent protests from her CDU.
"To be clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party chief said on Monday after meetings of the CDU top boards in Berlin.
At first, however, Merkel did not set out on a detailed model.
In the black-red government program, "determined parameters" were called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal, and it is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also making a constructive contribution to the deliberations on a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to compensate highway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU vice-president Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
“The coalition agreement never came to mean that all the district and federal roads should be paved,” said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU president.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will once again speak on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU national associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background concerns are that a toll will impair small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had called for coalition allegiance due to toll criticism from the CDU.
The left sees the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as a failure.
"The Murks toll is dead," party chief Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignetting obligation on all German roads, which is set to start in 2016.
Domestic car owners may not be charged additionally under the Coalition Agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, under EU law, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she only had a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure walking and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from feelings of deafness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she suffered from Peaceful Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing as the others.
I kept falling down and everything took longer.
I could never ride skates or skateboards with the other kids and was often bullied at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society,” she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my skills.
I did all this alone with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her abilities had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, “My dear, I don’t think you have this, otherwise you’d be in the wheelchair by now.”
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former training ground
For almost ten years, the former training ground in Münsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Schwabische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
An ear-drinking bang hangs over the heart of the biosphere area during the explosions.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since that time, the 6,500 hectares of area has been the core of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb, which is open on 13 designated trails for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax breaks for businesses in the country rose slightly last year as economic recovery accelerated, a new study published last week said, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia space jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local agencies in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent year-on-year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of falling modestly in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more strongly than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from businesses.
With 28 percent, Virginia has the lowest tax revenues from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in the company’s real estate values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the course seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, as property taxes here amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax cuts.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“In Maryland, the following happens: a large portion of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The latest recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the region’s highest amount.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses does not increase uniformly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district corresponded with 4.3 percent to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Virginia alone reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
With 6 percent in all three departments, Virginia has the significantly lower corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and overall a better tax climate prevails than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businesses – a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized according to – in the District, Maryland, and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth in businesses than the previous year.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxation across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general VAT revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, Washington’s space could lag behind if the federal government’s spending cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China is now looking for a brewery and is also looking forward to a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - that's the urgent request of officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle down in our city,” Li Yiwei, deputy party secretary of the South China metropolis, said this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China came back in the course of the conversation to this concern of the twelve million metropolises.
Guangzhou, also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, warb Li.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German politicians’ delegation, told the host that he would be interviewed in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, cereal and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
Afterwards, the official from Guangzhou came across a sheep’s dumpling – but with red wine that was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Chairman Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the municipal politician showed himself convinced.
"Business traffic between our two cities continues to increase".
Currently, travelers have to take the route via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also looking forward to the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the forefront of his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, agreed.
Maintained partnership
The likable vice-chairman of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the top, but not yet in this role.
He only came to office this year after his predecessor had been removed from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being enforced harshly by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000-kilometre-long Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese alliance was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, they want to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family "presses their thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was delivered to a New York City hospital, but her daughter showed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all pushing our thumbs.
According to sources, her mother was delivered to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to a heart attack at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors intentionally keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners, which are now on the market, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from September 1 will be given a label on which the buyer can at a glance recognize key data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, sharper nitrogen oxide values apply in the "Euro 6" class of pollutants.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported Monday morning: the online retailer – and video producer, and a host of other things – buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like selling Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion thing, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their favorite pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” an insider said.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-wishers give the (mostly older) plays a coating of secret science theaters, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is Twitch’s incredible success.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watch, it’s hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play rather than taking control of the console itself.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a spinner shoot him in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All of these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control of the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-paced flows in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as a game or humor virtuoso isn’t present, its Twitch channel probably isn’t that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth-largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch is as elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have easily swallowed.
But Twitch has one thing every company would love: thousands of young men being recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggarten Fest on Sunday night.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air party in the castle garden.
In time, the entrance had to be stopped.
“It was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt waffle l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sakraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already shown early Sunday evening, when the first visitors opened up for the Open Air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they did it.
Around the supply stalls on the Burggarten Wiese there had been salt dealers, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings had become cozy.
They tracked the first live performances, whistled with their feet in tact, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were trendy.
And this through the generations.
While one of them blinked on the extra white sand at the beach bar on the ceiling, while others simmered at a quarter of the wine in the winery, the young man stumbled on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in children's makeup, the volunteer helpers in the truest sense of the word had their hands full to become the Andrang Lord and to enchant imaginative creations into the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which was organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he slammed down on the visitors, especially families looking for the breadth and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not make this a break.
“There were more people coming than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success all over the line.”
Therefore, there is nothing against a repetition of the big party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the popular vote.
He said that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security firm had been booked with too little power.
The result: some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who were tugging in the castle garden.
There were problems with tone technology.
The saltweedler hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox broke off their performance.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-sensible sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to saltwater due to a tyre pan.
“But next year they will be there,” said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will still be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
Even on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to put in criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken over a little bit," Ele Zimmermann says at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I find it very good that some are not only stupid chatting, but also really trying to put something on their feet.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
Now the organizers have one year to put aside these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg’s landmark shrinks
This is not expected to be the case.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
The size is still a world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the cap change
The upper quarter of the old casing is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope will be set up.
If the weather is good, the action will go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge gets jaw-dropping
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went painfully beside it.
A woman was taken to the hospital after she cried so loudly during the Ice Bucket Challenge that she was ripped out of her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom crawled so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I shouted, and while I did, my jaw just stood there,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn’t work, the jaw was stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw that too and made themselves almost into the pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was taken to the hospital to have the jaw receded after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the burglary associations soon be pulling back on a string?
Lastly, there was again and again quarrel between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereine.
Now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshausen castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshausen Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
So far, the points of view seemed to differ, as to how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the association directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we get together once,” Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of both clubs could re-engage in the future.
Thus, it is possible to achieve visible successes faster.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest until the end, the "development and revitalization" of the site stands at the forefront of the castle club around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been standing before the castle friends.
A new chairman is scheduled to be found in a meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club's activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was needed to "think about how it could continue".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood picture within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a wolfratshauser.
Tölzer wants to "but very much like to continue to work on the project".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He credits Dimbath as a "missionary" who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high participation of the population as well as by volunteer helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “I was skeptical at first, too.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward. It could be created a "single setting feature" for the river city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally don't want to throw the idea of rebuilding overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving at this point.
Their goal to document the story first is "important and good".
After that, you could see further.
Clever ways to save on Uni textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the Fast Second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a smart idea.
He invented a loan system for books from higher-semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A cookie,” said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there were different cost-saving options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring, Neebo’s vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price they are on the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be found at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buying used
If the notes of other or normal traces of use do not matter to one, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous expenses were permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative to used books by eBay Inc.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, remember to return them and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the rules of the business where you are renting, including the penalty fees that may apply for writing notes, documents or traces of use.
Tenant alert: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be attending Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, so Gault, if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not become a cashier
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" recorded less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz’s “Sex Tape” made only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children’s movies like “Dragon-Cams Easy 2” also disappoint with revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children’s films could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" to date for children's films and described "dragon Charms Made Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, with films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch that was shown on at least 2,000 screens between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of film critics and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming Jungle Book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash-outs of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues with streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, when revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics filming and foretelling a "nuclear meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his obscure prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men's producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in cashier results as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporters, "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinemas at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When the 2nd class of table tennis district was abolished a few years ago for the purpose of tightening the league division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program.
The result: whoever has not ascended has descended.
For example, Göttingen’s top-ranked team Torpedo has avoided the downhill in the Oberliga relegation, but will only play fifth in the coming season.
Torpedoes remain fourth-class ladies, despite their grand march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve will join the new Bundesliga, with the Landesliga no longer represented by Göttingen clubs.
In the women's league, the TTV Geismar plays in the league, the second torpedo in the national league.
What of the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district superliga South.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC take part.
In the district league play as regional representatives of Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, red-white, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each.
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The SCW boys' district league staff - where Torpedo II is still starting - is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West-Staffel are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the Ost-Staffel, among others.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Himmeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode, where there are no women’s teams at all.
Noticing that none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves target strength, here the innovative and dynamic circuit board will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-top.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments over the weekend and spoke with protesters who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teens flying out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bush hikers were brought to safety with the rope wind after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath for their tour.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
An addict group from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured herself on her knee and the man had fallen and had smashed his head open.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The transmitter resumed the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of election fraud.
Police said that about a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence, there were again clashes between some 3,000 demonstrators and security forces on Monday.
According to hospital reports, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend when protesters tried to enter Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday night after a meeting at the Army Headquarters, "without wasting time and without using force".
It said in a statement: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has spurred concern about an intervention by the military, which has already pushed more often in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been ongoing since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to persevere on Sunday.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri said the same thing.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially insisted peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to come to Sharif’s residence over the weekend.
Hutteldorfer placed third in the table after his second season victory.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday came to an end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team reached an intermediate level with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green-white.
With the second victory of the season, Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes to the country game break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said defender Thomas Schrammel, who with his wonderful lead volley from the 16th in the 14th minute has set the mark on victory.
"I thought I had cleaned up all Thursday's fries and sniffed him under the latte," the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship winner in the Rapid dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, it's something very special, I'm from the Rapid-news," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic’s short-term pelvis bliss, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirrored way.
He deserved the goal, he has already made some assists," Barisic said.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after well an hour, which finally made the decision.
Before that, the guests would have been able to write.
"Thank God we had some luck today," Schrammel said, pointing to the interplay between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results did not vote, but the gameplay was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that they had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played at this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team composition is intact despite the rebounds: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
It’s no less pleasant for him: “That we’ve finally played to zero again.”
Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures are to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their debut, makes the victory even more valuable.
"You mustn't forget that," said Barisic, who lost to Behrendt and Pavelic in the last three days, "who have been very stable lately."
Therefore, the play-offs must be used to “leak wounds and add a little bit in the physical area,” Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks, said.
One to whom the break probably comes particularly close is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself up for the team, going over pain.
"In this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "You shouldn't believe that everything is good now" "We've certainly also had a bit of luck, but at some point the luck has to come back to us.
Now is the time,” said Hofmann.
He said: “You can’t always see it in black and white.
We haven’t played as bad in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They stick to me at certain stages,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to do with himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-attack "from the Magic Gate" as well as the regular goal of use in the 40th minute, which had been misrepresented by referee Kolegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We had too few conclusions there.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started just as bad, but then we found it clean and even made a goal.
In general, there would have been more inside.
Under this whirlwind there is peace
We showed a powerful tribe on our puzzle mission of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the county, the illustrated specimen is the "geisha" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A hollow-lined footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It passes by groups, basalt stone piles and basalt stone lakes.
A little below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stands out above the other trees in the surroundings, reminiscent of an American mammoth tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishopsheim Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what it has to do with the geisha.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from underwater wells to the meadows that were tediously rodent and free of stones.
At the foot of the tree should have rested the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the pastures there are actually sheepherds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further said.
When entering the stone collections, however, one should be careful, because the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place for crusaders to stay.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further trails are indicated, climb up towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle that is sought in our next task is rarely found in the height.
The reflection in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the county, to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our "piece of rhino's happiness" located?

After weeks of resignation, Italy’s Prime Minister and current EU President Matteo Renzi last week pushed for the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy, succeeding Britain’s Catherine A.
Renzi considers, as the government-run daily La Repubblica reports, the appointment of his favourite Mogherini in the government team as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his “reform package” in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm the leftist party base, which is constantly rising against him, because Mogherini will be assigned to it, albeit in a more moderate manner.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as Council President Donald Tusk, so the prevailing opinion in Rome will be created in order to achieve a political balance.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomat will be Vice-President Juncker.
The European Parliament’s continued approval is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica propagates optimism that the Mogherini, known for her ambition, has proved to be the "huge challenges" for almost two decades.
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Central Party Margherita into the present-day Social Democratic PD in 2008.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the 2001 election to the party council of the left democrats, she entered the high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional centres of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on the NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he consulted with Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s more than 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The talks in Brussels, the new EU External Action Service (EEA) has too little diplomatic experience, so lack of substance, is countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini’s distrustful realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamated as a “Russia-friendly course”.
It supports the South Stream pipeline, which is operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves Italy’s energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos she showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin leader to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people began their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
The new employees will work in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All azubis come from Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bucherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Testrebl.
The new trainees previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages and trainees will go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting at the inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of apprentices distributed over all anniversaries is 27.
The socialists in France should “keep their mouths shut and make France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show “their love” for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet formation has been met with disapproval by the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain by his side," he said with great applause.
As a staggering gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a loosening of the regime by Emmanuel Macron, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves “united” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, spread sand into the gearbox, in which she appeared at a meeting of defiant socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French “belief in their future”.
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the Socialists’ constant grave fighting and said she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new won't survive autumn or winter either," Ms Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident to stand out as a winner in the upcoming elections and be ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of the Dutch term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment.
“There’s a small window to opportunities, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Norwegian Cruise just before a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise operator, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy customer base, while it is with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival We.CCL.
A deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end unsuccessfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to be able to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues stood at $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice with cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises jointly have 82 percent of the passenger capacity of U.S. cruise ships, according to the original Prestige Cruises application documents.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A Beijing loyal group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied by Beijing-faith members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and smear Hong Kong’s financial center with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that the call for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper in which China’s dominance of Hong Kong was outlined in June, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, with hundreds of thousands marching into the city’s business district and a sit-in organization there.
Lis survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Legal Committee of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in the afternoon in front of Hong Kong’s top leadership office.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom did not provide any democratic elements.
Putin urges Kiev to start "statement talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state" of the absconding region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory under the control of the separatists of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status with respect to Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to inter-represent its rights.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government for high-profile negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents fits with the strategy he apparently pursued since the start of the outcry five months ago: Una help for the separatists in the process of annexation of territories by the Russians and pressure on the pro-Ukrainian regime.
In an interview with state-run TV channel Eins, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossia" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glowing era of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hope to be "captured in their illusions".
"We need to immediately engage in detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South-Eastern Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said Putin’s reference to statehood should be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership in order to spread fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, Peskow said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification of correcting the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored Russia’s leadership’s claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period gave a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy spoken by Russian diplomats in international forums would empower regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, which produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian legislation should consider - after new elections - additions to the Constitution, which will allow the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and uprising Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level was followed by a further advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine across the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Nowoasovsk in hand, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to the Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have taken place to fortify Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged actions to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are at a point where there is no back," Poroshenko said.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, presumably included in the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Noelsten didn’t make a fuss about his annoyance over hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the A-Promise from Hollywood.
The film town is in excitement after a series of unambiguous photos of a nude Jennifer Lawrence popped up in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "The Tribute of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne also reportedly made private photos public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noblest, who had engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said according to a news website that the hack was "shameful" and that those affected felt "injured".
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies up without in a pool.
Palmer’s film works include “Love is Invincible” with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked images.
A spokesperson for Lawrence' told TMZ: "It's an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing more than selling hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the further dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers participated yesterday at the 8th cycling event on the Großer Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-affected children".
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the others.
However, they all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski had a good night’s sleep last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery yesterday took a bicycle to the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
The little muscle caterpillar can easily get away with it, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favour of the Association "Help für Krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) has also personally given him a valuable insight.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - fine!"
Little pause on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out of...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves to the mountains yesterday in the early hours and came close to exhaustion, but happily arrived on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, fell easier to overcome the well eleven-kilometre long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the circle – red dress, red bike – did something about understatement at the start (“Every lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!”), but then turned out to be a half-professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He has also crossed the track in a slide, as has Nina Kuhn, a press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel, who had made her way along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "fieldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "It's about charity, we're happy with it - we would have made an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to climb up again.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung himself into the saddle at home at 9 a.m., "made" the Feldberg twice, then to roll home with fun.
He also had fun with "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberursel Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply one of them.
He had pedaled for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilogram racing wheel.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - that's where I like to be," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
That must be him, because he was on the road with the "Fixie-Rad", although these are also racing bikes, but without circuit...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed the White Wall and the dampness to the top prove that it went up slowly without a bike, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind him on a rope.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, ensured safety, said: "I know" him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleigh trail, only that he pulls the sleigh himself.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were sent to the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
It was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers took off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radfahren auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
