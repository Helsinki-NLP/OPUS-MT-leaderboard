In an emergency call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend.
While calling the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it is necessary to come to them home.
Lamb suggested that his "sweet dog" was at home alive and probably upset, and that contacts to a dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on a white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," Lamb said in a letter.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
Delta State University Chief of Police Lynn Buford said the university's staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb reportedly made a fatal phone call to the emergency line shortly thereafter.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, students and faculty were forced to hide behind closed doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out what Lamb's motivation was.
Details, published by investigators on the side of the state as well as students and employees who knew him, together created the image of a talented but probably problematic teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in gratitude to the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with the other 17 faculty members and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations when it comes to problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
This year he has only taught two online courses.
The recent changes regarding the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mrs. Lamb apparently bothered something."
Lamb is no longer going to answer these questions.
After he left the campus, police captured his footprint as he crossed the Arkansas state line back to the Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gun shot in the backyard of a house about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3,500 students in the city, which has a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
In the spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb's 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older guy who taught her guitar for several years.
It was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls were drawn as soon as he showed up," says Hairston, now 40, who lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss had been together for some time.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of the wedding never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," said O'Steen of his daughter.
She was a best friend with her mother.
O’Steen said he hadn’t met with Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O’Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, who saves a lighted bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweating what Lamb had picked up on guitar and harmonica for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We fished and recorded each other for jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, conducted a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students, and community members, took part in a commemorative event with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, the school started again.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually fiancées.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Less Seasonal Workers
Toys R Us declares that they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturers of children’s toys and products say it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire around 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will start recruiting candidates this month, and employees will be recruited during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching, and companies are preparing to temporarily accept employees for help in stores and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in Time."
The film starts and I feel like I’m on the verge of something that might be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back in the Future," which features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “It’s truly the best travel document to me that has ever been filmed.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
U.N. Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that there is “no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support an inclusive negotiation on finding a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the verge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret at the fact that the divisions in the Council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show their solidarity and unity in reaching Iran’s nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 Electoral Numbers That Show Donald Trump in Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands as if they were an unguided joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But regardless of whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they will not succeed (for now).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead on a two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what it means for this real estate magnate’s nomination chances.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that during this time of 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, eventually not one of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into the general election.
But external groups like Super PAC Jeba Bush and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are realizing Trump’s will to withstand and are starting to put their dollars on hold in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the real estate magnate is not just a transitional phase:
Trump’s rating of favorability has reversed by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are kept in the initial stages.
After a vote by Quinnipiac University last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "surprised" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "disappointed" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enjoyed” against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disrupted” if Jeb Bush’s favorite company became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his outrage and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to think that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the post of president, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post vote.
The same number is held at the Iowa State Senate Club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think they have the personality of a commander, according to last week’s Quinnipiac.
Yet 44 percent think they don’t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 say his temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their student hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s a change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
In the last round, four out of ten Republicans elected Rick Perry as the candidate against 28 percent for Mitt Romney’s nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is widely spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always get majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the trader by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have already made their point.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they will not change their opinion.
Obviously, it can change a lot of things, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for a change among the candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has still held up as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s buoyancy will drag key Hispanic voters away from the Republican party and damage efforts to rebrand.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the theme of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive about half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote on Monday say they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
Voting for the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent are "inferno angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state’s coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the House of Representatives endorsed the government’s novel of the upper law, which regulates the amount of revenues from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) promised to the MPs that thanks to this they will receive additional money both from the state treasury and from the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticised by opposition lawmakers, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipality as they have been, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.In the first reading, the House of Commons, after the first reading, of the company’s payrolls, would have supported the government’s report from the top law.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent so far to 33 percent.
The template also changes the method of calculating the payment for non-residents that companies will extract.
The change in the fees for the mining of crops is expected to bring to the public treasury by 427 million CZK more than in 2013.
According to the government, it is expected to have a neutral impact on municipal budgets, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million kroner from the fees and the state budget 150 million kroner.
The mining of brown coal cost the municipalities about CZK 200 million and the state about CZK 66 million.
The novel also counts on an increase in compensation from mining sites with an allowable mining to SEK 1000 per hectare per year.
Income from these payments shall remain to the fullest extent to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told the MPs that as a result, the municipalities will receive 14 million to 100 million kroner a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
Compensation will be recalculated as the ratio of the amount of harvested non-growth and the rates for each type of non-growth.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the fixing of the fee by government regulation may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mladka, however, in this case it is not about tax, because the state charges non-growth, which is state property.
The fees are paid only to the municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will apply to the mining of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state chooses on the mining fees will be purposefully tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damages after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs, who in particular argued that it would harm the towns and regions affected by the mining.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Starostov<0xC3><0xA1>) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David K<0xC3><0xA1>dner (Usvit) elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>stek region.
KS<0xC4><0x8C>M MEP Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> warned about the rise in unemployment in Mosteck.
K<0xC3><0xA1>dner and Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for refinement.
The report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in tariffs will not reflect on coal prices, because prices are contracted from more than 90 percent in the long term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the increase in prices.
"However, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, the increase in fees in terms of employment is negligible.
According to the report on the Milan Urbana (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) novel, it is crucial for MPs to know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining even before passing the law.
If coal will benefit from limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dk that the decision to break the border at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should not fall until after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should already be broken due to social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Joyful will lead the Czechs as one, deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the table during Thursday's draw of the Davis Cup in India, and this time they are likely to be involved in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til plans to spread the burden over the entire quartet due to the difficult conditions.
In Delhi, it is hot and humid, which is why tough matches are expected, which can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out depending on the weather.
And according to what it will look like, said Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til during today’s training of the Czech selection in the center of Radja Kum<0xC3><0xA1>r Kh<0xC3><0xA1>nna.
With the first team and the world's 40th Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Vesel<0xC3><0xBD>, he counts on Friday and Sunday to play two games.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek will probably be in the position of the pair.
I'd like for almost everyone to get involved.
I've got a little bit of it in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, said the captain.
Another surety in the Czech team should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nkova’s participation in Saturday’s quarterfinals.
It's just a question of who's standing next to the seasoned debilitator who has an 18:4 four-game balance in the Davis Cup.
I don't think he'll be happy.
There are still options with Rosol, or Adam Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek.
"I really don't know who it will look like," he said back.
It depends on the development of the two.
A variant may be Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek, with Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> surprised in the 1st round by winning in the debut over Australany.
"He's decent in the ass," he said back.
“I was successful against Australia, and if I’m going to play, I’d like to perform the same performance I’ve shown since the second set.
"I'm happy for those experiences and I'd like to bring a point," said Pavl<0xC3><0xA1>sek.
The home team put in two Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ranking), who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the players third and fourth hundredth in the rankings.
The duo will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both of them are challengers and we have the experience of the ATP Tour, but many times we have already convinced ourselves that the rankings in the Davis Cup do not qualify.
"It governs the current form, the weather," he said.
Friday's opening two games will start at 6:30 CET and can be stretched due to the weather.
It's supposed to rain and the yard's not under the roof.
However, it can be played with artificial lighting.
They've already lit it, and it's about two thousand luxes, which is enough.
"It should be done under the lights," he said back.
Jeremy Corbyn to Debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn’s debut in PMQ has been eagerly awaited.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in Prime Minister’s Questions later on, and will have to work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will raise the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance will likely be carefully examined by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he called for "less theatre and more facts."
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby’s leadership to come after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC’s annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to stand in silence during the national anthem singing in service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he would "stand in a venerable silence" and recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle for Britain."
But Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "no matter what" his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economy, defense, and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in the work are also "crushing" after Mr Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's pay limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a limit on benefits.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party had "very clearly" warned government plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party to face David Cameron in the last decade since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain from both "emergency responses" and dental trade, instead promising to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also gave up the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak for him from time to time, because he had heard that the whole matter was still being discussed with the Speaker of the House, John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the “Punch and Judy” style of politics that was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later admitted that he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership, and their stance among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become caricatures and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Focus in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound rises as wage growth accelerates in the UK
The pound jumped the following dates and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was driven higher using the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB profits including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it looked as if estimates were approaching when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after getting a bid approach from its rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and the approach of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from rival luxury group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose $2.5bn using shared positioning as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the parcel and paper group Mondi were the biggest drop on the index and fell 4.3% after Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on the company to "sales."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in mid-year earnings before tax <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment marshmallow cheer.
Controversial construction got a stop.
Investor Prague Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision illegal and will appeal against it.
The building, which is to be built in close proximity to the Ane<0xC5><0xBE>ské Monastery in the centre of Prague, was protested by 1 hundred people before the Prague office, and a petition was also created.
The Magistrate found in the decision that there was a violation of the construction law because not all matters of the territorial decision were complied with.
"The territorial decision in question does not include some matters, for example the type of land, distance from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clearly and intelligibly described shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the impact of the construction," the decision reads.
It also considers it illegal to have some of the documents for the decision given to the documentation originally discussed, which, however, has changed.
This is for example the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the documentation that the owner of the land has thus only proved his consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not his consent to the location of the building on his land, writes the department of construction regulations.
According to Francesco Augusto Razett of the investment firm, the Construction Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review has already expired.
This is, after all, a scandalous process.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow because of the supposedly designed color of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade due to it, generates strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the centre of the city to protest the construction.
The associations and residents of nearby houses are upset that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE>ské Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fr<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the project has changed several times.
The original version of the 2008 project, which had a glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Institute of Monuments (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and in 2010 revoked the permission of Prague monuments.
The new project of the company Prague Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces but NPU and magistrate monuments approved and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the remarks of the opponents, saying he never counted on the pink facade, which gave the project a nickname after the pink-white candy.
The Czech politicians took the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in the bass with them.
Berg went to Hungary in order to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who were said to be about half a kilometre away.
At the time, he said it was not criminal in Hungary, he told the People's Newspaper.
We knew that the law enforcement officers did not interfere with such behavior.
But when the police arrested us, to our surprise, they arrested us and took us to the investigative prison in Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in politics.
The policemen said they were acting correctly, but they did not communicate because they could not speak English very well.
The prison, he said, was sad.
For example, in our cell, about three times four meters in size, 15 refugees from Syria were displaced.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were already closed the next day and because of the language barrier, none of them had any idea what would happen to them, Berg said.
What can't be entertaining?
Ask the Presidents of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday, September 18th, from 9:30 am, the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, Mgr. Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, will answer the questions of the readers.
You can ask her about changes to the Enforcement Act in force from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or enforcers.
Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s incursion in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight the invasion of Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through show-dealers such as show-deals and social media.
IGA dealers and suppliers add brands such as Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings at IGA stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware retailers celebrate their annual investor strategic day.
There’s a lot at stake because southern and western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA trade moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores have a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi is hitting 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a fixed price base of Metcash could cost him around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan’s latest survey found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s food sales to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share to fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the fund’s chief executive, founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne “could be very likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it's known that Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s food trade earnings, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of the change in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesale has gone counter-attack, investing more than $150 million a year to align the countertop prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says pricing programs and trade equipment are catching up and hopes that wholesales will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side loss in a recent run around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says Australian Tennis President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called the "Special Ks," attracted unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the notorious Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in a passionate qualifying game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated by a referee twice, Harrison then stated: "Wawrinka should have pulled one to Kyrgios and I should have pulled one to him too."
While Kokkinakis was last seen hitting the rocket after a concussion diminished Richard Gasquet's ability at the US Open, Kokkinakis relentlessly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a second-place finish behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
“I thought quite intensely about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute,” says Healy.
He destroyed the rocket when he lost due to a stroke in the US, but he is not the first player to kick his anger out of frustration on his own rocket. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But seriously, he managed very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a bit hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits in the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, in the dressing room he is highly respected, he trains hard, he is in an amazing condition of his own, it is a very stable and mature mind to be with a young boy after a boy.
Healy also backed the decision to skip Kyrgios because of an important match that starts on Friday, saying "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but it supports the Canberry native to return to the team as a long-term stalemate.
“First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the match and not on all the controversy around him [Kyrgios],” says Healy.
And I think that Nick rose very quickly, as Federer, Murray and others show, he grows rapidly in the eyes of the public, he has also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the best criticism he receives for his own sake, but we are trying to support him for his own time, we are trying to help him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday after announcing the state of threat and detained those who tried to illegally cross it in order to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border as hundreds of migrants piled up in the country and the Serbian authorities reacted outrageously.
Those who have been trapped for an unknown time on the strips of land between the two states are those fleeing violence in their home countries, building tents and settling in.
But there is a feeling of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants call together "Open the Borders!" and hand over the regular units of the Hungarian police.
Some people refuse food and water to protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister says it was “unacceptable” for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
In the coming days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in surprise Italy and Greece and spoke in the hopes of reaching an agreement next month or at the end of the year that the EU nations would welcome more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not raise its hopes for Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday’s state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and allowed them to shut down roads and speed up the trial of asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a fence from a sharp wire along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D <0xCC><0x81>Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped draw a sharp wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other countries of the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees who are looking for protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize the violation of the 4 metre fence, which the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of threat," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we are quite clear: illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but reporters at the border have been watching a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said authorities had captured 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught on the state's territory.
They have penetrated through the fence and are now in police custody accused of committing violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly repaired the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with wire.
There was chaos at the main border crossing at Roszke, as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and created a press room for people.
About 20 of them came in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's runoff from Bernie Sanders cut by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead in the Democratic nominee race at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is picking up her lead.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he wants to become president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clear decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground to several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a major breakthrough among women and mitigates, but her leadership is tightening.
Her support among men has declined significantly and Sanders loses only 5 points on her.
Clinton’s advantage with Democratic voters under 50 has faded and they are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton is still a big leader thanks to the older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points to her in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the states say they would have enthusiastically supported Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are especially envious of her.
The views are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supporting her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), follows that it’s time for a woman to be president (13%), and that she’s the best candidate for this job (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Furthermore, there is a great opportunity to choose and agree on the problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to head for it – a third think he should not run.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, Biden was the most common choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half of Biden was listed as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden is running, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be optimistic is rising.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of an election.
Just like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate appears to be an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some of the key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As far as all these criteria are concerned, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as state secretaries, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it’s not their overall view of her.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public’s views on this topic were divided as early as March, shortly after this problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no impact on their overall view of Clinton, while at 36 percent, their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
It is mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 say their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as being honest and trustworthy among her party’s voters, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as being honest and trustworthy, which is a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points away.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don’t think she’s honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as being honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good signs of leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but as with Carson, many voters have not made an opinion on him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends up with Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson Approaches Donald Trump in Latest CBS News/New York Times Survey
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, while the others are left with support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% of support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well-behaved across demographic groups, and excludes Trump from among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasiche, is behind with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the verge of falling from 10% support to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed that Carson had improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans for Trump’s 32% support.
A recent survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s rising trend, Trump decided to shoot blindly at a neurosurgeon in the service, and even Carson apologized for interrogating Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First-year Baruch College Student
Nearly two years after a student died during an exaggerated fraternal ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and lately took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Police say he had his eyes tied, his backpack full of sand weighing 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Dog Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before being taken to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Dengo’s dress, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s nationwide president, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their equipment and essentially preferred the welfare of the brotherhood over Michael Deng’s life,” said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to recover and died the next morning.
According to the whistleblower report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a dumb object in the head, trunk and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated due to fraternity overcrowding, and at least one student has been dying every year from overcrowding since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo’s family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must take responsibility, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assaulting and criminal association.
"We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity and the national fraternity canceled its relationship with local branches.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates.
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will bludgeon, bond yields will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy specifically, the history of a small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve system in raising rates is often, if not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hike will start, but rather on the trajectory of how long the normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all custom due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more common, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past month, the expected rate hikes can make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase is made, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend to re-stopp shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's rise.
To be more precise, the market for the last approximately 35 years Barron Management often most - about 14 percent - aims to increase rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then the company returns again to the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom, with an average of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.
Deutsche said the impact on the stock tends to become more pronounced later in the rate increase cycle and returns are starting to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rising rates often help it.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could accelerate the recession.
Most notable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history while raising the Fed’s rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, the nominal annual GDP growth was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, the Atlanta Fed reports.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and a question could arise, "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready to grow the Fed all year round and all eyes turned to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our 1950 study, all of the boosting cycles so far were in a super-cycle of leverage boosting with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now 74 months and we are still going on.
Fixed returns were also volatile, as the market expects interest rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to that experienced by stocks.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
In the case of bonds, returns seem to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the bond growth cycle, bond yields fall immediately," said Deutsche.
Strategists Charles Schwab believe that rising rates will bring returns closer to long- and short-dated bonds, which offsets the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, even though “we are still careful about straining yields,” said Kathy Jones, a firm fixed-rent analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a more stringent monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spread has widened, and the volatility has increased – all features of the market as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that run most of their business in the U.S. will win after interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will do worse, as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be higher.
“History shows that the ‘quality’ of stocks tends to outperform within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Apart from purely stock games, consumers also benefit thanks to the rising dollar.
Sparers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have differing opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the station for "grabbing"
He is of the opinion that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial competitor
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said they were simply cheating the British.
Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he is not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" into Classic FM, a leading MP claims, and is accumulating fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appears to be "scattered" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word 'stuffed' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which began in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are two examples that strike me when you’re actually just imitating what we already have on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC’s director-general rejected the charges on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I’ve learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn’t learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and making music is actually at the cutting-edge level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's production, which got under fire due to kicking on the heels of business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as being non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which September stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when it launches the next fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers' money on license fees for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest rate since August and on the blame may be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, it was the lowest growth since the records themselves began in 2000.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for slowing spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and thanks to it, many of Britain’s main streets have become ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs of steadying online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the measurement in 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of steadying online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the level of growth over the past years and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always been streamlined over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG’s revenue index.
It explains that online sales were boosted three years ago, when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to be stalling.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from making purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times more than the average buyers turned to their computers to arrange their purchases, while dropping several websites of sellers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers are contracting again, can keep customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, rather than shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims Bury Victims of Crane Falls in Mecca and Bin Laden Family Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were transported through the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mexico City.
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of Saudi construction tycoon Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crash of a crane in the Grand Mosque in Mexico City.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose their way and paid homage to the victims when the first of the dead got on his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the believers.
The body was released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the crash of a crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mexico were carried by the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first voyage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual pilgrimage to the Hajj.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hajj will take place in Mecca and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not leave the crane shoulder up when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the decree, carried by the Saudi state-run news agency, says Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The UK’s record agency did not report the details, but said the company’s bosses were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not made available for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mexico City, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and are running major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was the son of an apostate, whom the family gave up in the 1990s.
The accident happened amid strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people in the kingdom embarked on a pilgrimage that every skilled Muslim must complete at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) will be devoted to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q Chief Claims Eastern European Traders Working Cheaply Already Trending Text
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of educated traders from Eastern Europe is nearing a growth point
The result is open 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Processed by Rupert Steiner, Principal Correspondent for Daily Mail
The British say they are laying down hammers and brushes and handing them over to skilled East European craftsmen to work at their homes.
If you have a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing artisans to carry out culinary work at their homes, according to the head of the company at Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for home appliances, says that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix retail stores, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
At present, most of the workers are male.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more female households making more household adjustments than they did in the past.
Ms. Laury says: “Most men still work in our stores.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women who make 80% of decisions about buying goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women at the steering wheel of leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence between male and female directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having a half-representation of women among employees including executive and chief financial officer.
Ms Laury says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced the loss both in profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the cost of closing the trades.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 kroner to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said the vice president of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura, President of the ODS, noted that the one-off contribution sounds good, but in the long term it would be better to be in standard valorisation, because it would be projected into the next few years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), according to which it was to be valued above the law next year.
Marx defended the grant with the argument that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she does not believe is pink.
A higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every one hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valuation has decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Op<0xC3><0xA1>lka (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The veto of the right of payment in December will make it significantly complicated and possibly impossible, he said.
The chairman of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD MPs, Roman Sklen<0xC3><0xA1>k, therefore, proposed shortening the deadline for negotiating the norm in the committee to ten or 20 days, even blocking the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus is expected to cost a total of 1.73 billion kroner.
The money is to go mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions are expected to increase by an average of about one hundred kroner.
The contribution should be received according to the pension plan by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost the right to a pension in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing, at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valorized regularly to January, by price growth and a third of real wages growth.
This year’s pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross salary, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
Last year, the state spent 314.7 billion kroner on old-age pensions, an increase of about five billion a year, according to the state’s final account.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenditures.
The average full old-age pension increased by 104 to 10,714 kroner last year, according to the data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration ensured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 relative pensions.
Jakunin abandoned plans for a political career, will be devoted to science.
According to the Russian media, the Senate chair was almost certain.
In the Council of the Federation was to represent the Kaliningrad region of West Russia, whose governor Nikolay Cukanov as a candidate of the United Russia government defended his post in Sunday's elections.
According to Russian laws, senators do not elect citizens, but are chosen by the governor from three candidates, whose names will be announced before the gubernatorial elections.
After the election, the senator chooses himself from the three candidates.
A complication for Jakunina was the fact that he lived in the Kaliningrad area for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exception for Yakunin, but he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, which is not covered by the legal requirement of long-term stay.
The filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The last drop in the protagonist's premise is the voluntary death of his mother-in-law, who has been hit with strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Jan<0xC5><0xBE>urov<0xC3><0xA1> decided on her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is on a similar journey with his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1>.
He will remember that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again in dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the previous one, Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k told the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedic form a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners did not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would belong to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>k, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We had an agreement three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a spoiled athlete.
In the past, he always asked where he would be sitting before filming another scene.
This time he rode his bike, climbed the rocks, and even walked up the hill.
And all this in the record-breaking tropical rains, the director said.
According to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, women take a tiger to make it into a rabbit over time.
They'll feed him a little, but they'll close the door immediately, so that he doesn't think of playing outside the rabbit's tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie about, the actor commented.
His wife, who can have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was recreated by Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also nice, intelligent, empathetic and thinks well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to kill her husband, Bajgar said.
The film also portrays the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - T<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmov<0xC3><0xA1> and Pavla Beretov<0xC3><0xA1> - and the sons Erika and Pep<0xC3><0xAD>k - Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Havelk and Jakub Koh<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US-based internet company Google has pledged an additional $5.5 million (CZK 132.6 million) to help thousands of refugees flocking to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is more charitable than this internet company.
Azerbaijan has cancelled part of the visit to Telick for criticizing human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the ANO movement Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka postponed his upcoming trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, this is justified by last week’s EP resolution, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka co-authored.
With the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka lost the possibility of talks with official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
The path, which was planned several months in advance, Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka wanted to use to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, clarified the text sent by the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The resolution condemns "unrecognized repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in the political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent ruling against Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadizha Ismailova, who advocated the discovery of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its own air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out the establishment of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have such plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia already has an airborne naval base in Syria at the port of Tartus, which has so far been used rather as a service and logistics center.
According to reports by the Russian press, supplies of Russian weapons and military material to Syria have risen since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are weapons shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to set up an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains the basin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday spoke to Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria, which was their third phone call in ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to voice his concerns about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow’s support of Assad a losing bet.
Russia’s policy goals in Syria are rather vague.
According to him, Moscow has made its own satellite from Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing rather a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is supposed to be the main theme of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today’s Russian press speculation.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to a report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during the UN session.
However, the views among White House advisers are still diverging.
TASS today, referring to the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet had a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York stay.
Sesame oil is applied in the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When squeezing from seeds in the cold, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as bile.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common cause of death for Czechs for several years.
Inflammation of the gallbladder mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are a fan of Asian cuisine, you should not miss the sesame oil that is part of the original recipes for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the bile diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
Generally, the problems with the gallbladder relate especially to people who are overweight, who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be successfully used even in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should pay attention to the goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use to squeeze roasted seeds that have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will lose all the active substances, described Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>eck<0xC3><0xBD>, CEO of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolov, which produces organic virgin oils pressed for cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unfried white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press will be able to shed 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for labelling extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is beneficial in heart and blood vessel diseases.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamersky, who led the study at Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents preferred it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 <0xC2><0xB0>C it starts to burn.
It is better to use it, for example, to taste salads and is especially suitable in a diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids lower cholesterol levels the most.
When you have heart problems, you need to pay attention to the amount of fat and calories you eat.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in one tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
When it comes to the energy value of foods, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of the industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to touch on extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as much as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
With storage in the refrigerator, the shelf life is extended.
Old oil people know especially by their bitter tastes.
On the contrary, there is no gap at the bottom.
It is a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical cannabis seeds are considered to be superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
For this label, it is thanks to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and the person must take them from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to boost immunity and heal wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is a necessary part of the cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that it is one of the best-selling oils in Bohemia.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one spoonful in the morning.
Hemp oil is not tastefully pronounced, but it enhances immunity, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the magnificent company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, Americans are the most enthusiastic nation of barbecues.
There are 1.4 barbecues per household.
All over the world there are various barbecue competitions, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives did not grill.
The vast majority of them also grill several times a year.
To make the grilling successful, we should not underestimate the preparation - ideal is to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this and at the same time will leave you health-beneficial substances when grilling?
Generally, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begins to lose their appetite at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also lose the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from foods adjusted at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When the meat is said, the experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic on Sokolovsky will immediately be equipped with grape oil.
It perfectly complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by a unique feature of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
Even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils retains the health of beneficial substances, describes the benefits of the grape oil Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from the company Bohemia Oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in the fight against excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Consumption of grape oil also helps to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example when tasting salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
Thus, grilling can be used in two ways, marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juiciness.
When preparing a marinade, three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and seasoning.
For example, we add the acidity with apple cider vinegar and thus achieve the softening of the meat.
The spice in turn gives the meat taste and the oil preserves and provides the right cut, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can penetrate through the dark flesh.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This is especially true of flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling yourself, rub the grill with oil, thus preventing the burning of food.
An essential part of the barbecue is also the preparation of attachments.
To grilled meat and fish is suitable practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
For example, chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend Hot Summer salad.
You need: <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 piece of peas <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 handful <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 cup of chopped cucumbers <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 cup of a mixture of lettuce leaves <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 3 tablespoons of grape oil
In a salad bowl, add a chopped hand, chopped cucumbers and peaches into large cubes.
Depending on the taste of salt and pepper, you can also taste minced chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drizzle with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then sprinkle the salad with gently chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: It does not only depend on the medications, but also on the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only therapeutic care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultation, if they decide to have a child, social legal advice, recommendations on housing adjustment, etc. are included in the care of these sick.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement greatly prolongs the time when a sick person needs some compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subjected to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads to the end of the wheelchair.
This is why the Give Yourself a Chance page (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Yourself a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
With multiple sclerosis, it is said twice that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
It is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and postpone the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often deals with weakening of the lower limbs or imbalance.
The patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain the condition, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific difficulties of the patient," says MUDr. Martina Köv<0xC3><0xA1>ri, primary physician of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way in everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive thing about regular exercise is that patients check what they can do, and that strengthens their self-confidence.
"The endorphins are also excreted during the exercise and the person after it feels good," notes Dr. Kamila <0xC5><0x98>asov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Faculty Hospital of Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovské Vinohrady.
By influencing the physical side, we are influencing the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly intervene in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
“In the past, these patients were so-called saved, today we know that they need a targeted load,” says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, Preferential Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine, Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The goal of physiotherapy is to ensure that one remains as self-sufficient as possible, including job placement.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to ensure that each person receives a compensatory aid by tailoring it to his or her needs.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will shake it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It has to respond to a great burden - the loss of health.
With a soul like this, we have to go after someone, not try to kidnap everything on our own terms.
"I work with them to finally come to the conclusion that a full life can be lived even with a disability and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinov<0xC3><0xA1> - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the Airbus would not fly.
Aircraft production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or lightweight and solid composite materials that no one can manufacture and process right away.
Nevertheless, in addition to super-precise, computer-controlled machining machines, in addition to autoclaves for forming composites, one can encounter something as common as apple peckies.
In the drum, which resembles a pot of sugar, the edges of the sheet parts that just came out of the milling machine are washed in a pile of pec.
"No one has come up with anything better yet," says Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, CEO of aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
At the premises in Prague’s Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Letov is producing complete doors for the Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world, they supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, also enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There is also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Precision is the main motto here.
For example, the company lets the momentary keys be sorted twice a year.
If the yellow label lacks a record of checks, they should explain in the Prague race to the auditors of Airbus or Boeing, who are going to check regularly whether the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
The human senses, however, have not yet completely replaced the advanced technique.
There are 1500 threads on one door to the A320.
You have to pinch the rivets manually.
It'll take them two days.
Even according to the sound of the falling hammer, they will know if the thread is already properly pinned.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The nozzle can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's about twice the thickness of human hair.
During the check, a trained touch will come up.
When the controller crosses a string of threads with his finger, he knows if someone is out of tolerance.
Until then, he'll take an accurate angular meter.
Before 1989, the flight was fueled by an exercise aircraft L-39.
In 1991, none of them were produced.
The company had to quickly find new contracts.
It was then merged with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the selection process for emergency door suppliers for the A321 model.
The conversations with Boeing were not so happy.
“We were a small company that didn’t have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing a stable long-term supply,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> recalls.
The door to the U.S. manufacturer would remain closed if Letov did not join the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Aircraft Industry Association in 1999.
I was talking about our collaboration with Airbus.
The next day the negotiations with the French started, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
A year later, Latecoere bought a Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
In 2000, the assembly of parts of the doors for the A320 began.
Three years later, the top deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall due to deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoer, we wouldn't be able to get these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we'd make parts or small parts.
Partners want a 20- or 30-year supply guarantee, explains Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, the Czech company Latecoere achieved revenues of over 2.9 billion and profits after taxing 147 million kroner.
Exclusive status among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere in Prague has invested 1.5 billion kroner since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certifications, and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have made any doors to aircraft.
Obtaining certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated checks to maintain them is worth according to Dubai millions of kroner.
The production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to train employees, equip equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The company is now completing the preparation of a zinc and nickel-coated process to replace the previously harmful cadmium for human health.
Although they received the instructions from the manufacturer, they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people of Boeing will come, check the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
One set of samples are tested by themselves in their laboratory and then compared to ours, approaches the Dubai method by which customers check them.
The reward is the Prague company’s long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraers stands and falls.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But that doesn’t mean he can say anything at the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It states how much one door will stand after ten, fifty, stitches of made pieces.
The price per piece always drops to a certain limit value.
We need to get into this price pattern.
If not, we're going to get through, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are complete, is empty so far.
It is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-robotic threading and door fitting line is being built behind the curtain for the innovative A320 Neo.
The drilling speeds up and improves accuracy.
“This is a trend that is taking place in aviation,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The future line is insured.
Airbus reports that the airlines have so far ordered 3,278 new A320s.
Only a few meters away will be the line for the complete assembly of the door for the upper deck A380.
This is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production time and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubsky says.
Before, however, the company must pass qualification tests for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is also expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamline.
“It’s a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says proudly.
Latecoere, however, reaches the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In the Letov area, where he resides, there is no other place.
Before the French mother’s entry, the company had 180 employees.
Now he has 800, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new aircraft airlines order each year, they may not have to worry about the job.
Although he has contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague’s Latecoere faced a bankruptcy threat.
The French group did not have enough money for the September repayments of the loans.
Finally, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors earned a 37.4 percent stake in the company by raising the capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, or 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has registered a new share in existing shareholders for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222.9 million.
In total, the capital raised by 280 million euros.
The entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which share 85% of the market.
The average contract growth is expected to be 4% per annum until 2017.
The order book has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to a four-year production.
French media say that latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the droplets.
The Czech race in Prague’s Let<0xC5><0x88>anec is important for groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group’s revenues.
According to the number of employees, the group is the largest foreign branch.
MEPs supported a larger share of the state’s coal fees.
The change in the fees for the mining of crops is expected to bring to the public treasury by 427 million CZK more than in 2013.
According to the government, it is expected to have a neutral impact on municipal budgets, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received about 450 million kroner from the fees and the state budget 150 million kroner.
The mining of brown coal cost the municipalities about CZK 200 million and the state about CZK 66 million.
The novel also counts on an increase in compensation from mining sites with an allowable mining capacity of one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Income from these payments shall remain to the fullest extent to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told the MPs that as a result, the municipalities will receive 14 million to 100 million kroner a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
Compensation will be recalculated as the ratio of the amount of harvested non-growth and the rates for each type of non-growth.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the fixing of the fee by government regulation may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mladka, however, in this case it is not about tax, because the state charges non-growth, which is state property.
The fees are paid only to the municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will apply to the mining of radioactive rocks.
The part of the money that the state chooses on the mining fees will be purposefully tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damages after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticised today by opposition MPs, who in particular argued that it would harm the towns and regions affected by the mining.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Starostov<0xC3><0xA1>) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David K<0xC3><0xA1>dner (Usvit) elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>stek region.
KS<0xC4><0x8C>M MEP Hana Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> warned about the rise in unemployment in Mosteck.
K<0xC3><0xA1>dner and Aulick<0xC3><0xA1> unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for refinement.
The report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in tariffs will not reflect on coal prices, because prices are contracted from more than 90 percent in the long term.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the increase in prices.
"However, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, the increase in fees in terms of employment is negligible.
According to the report on the Milan Urbana (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) novel, it is crucial for MPs to know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining even before passing the law.
If coal will benefit from limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dk that the decision to break the border at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should not fall until after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should already be broken due to social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to Decide on Interest Rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The entire world is watching the U.S. Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists addressed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time and keep interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank could be able to get out of the zero latch and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has done fairly well, there has been a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the public account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less-pink global perspective.
They have warned the markets to be prepared for an increase, but the circumstances indicate that they also see great chances against this step.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University has left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday — and later that day his colleague — wrote a note claiming he was "sorry" for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, government officials said on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at around 10 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the policemen to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “will not bother anyone” but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the gun was fired at the house.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb that read, “I’m so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb set out on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
William LaForge, the dean of the university, said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb's head".
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was "no evidence" of the "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shocked" by the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss was working from home over the internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She's always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would “not go to jail.”
When police caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school’s website, Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has a number of stressful years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001 and lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
Of course, all of these things are taxing themselves.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw will be out of the game in a couple of months due to a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and kicked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moren's careless surgery in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV space.
He was treated on the court for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture of the leg and is now in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - the guy who comes to Manchester at 18 it's very difficult, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the closet, he also had an oxygen mask on.
Crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I’m sure he’ll be playing this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall said the Italian arbitrator was wrong.
You can decide for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty operation with both feet.
A tweet from Shawa’s account said: “Thank you all for their messages, words can’t express how destroyed I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I’ll come back even stronger.”
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very saddened by it.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg during a match for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I wasn’t able to see that moment.
I only saw the ball moving in the other direction, so it looked like [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn’t see an operation on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Is David Cameron really familiar with the Lorax?
This is something every parent knows: when a child loves a book, it doesn’t take long for them to learn to almost remember it.
You mustn't be David Cameron.
Asked by the provider of children's schemas to name a favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a 1971 fairy tale by Dr. Seusse.
It was hard to choose from, Cameron writes in a report published on SuperCamps’ website, and continues: “Funny, touching, creative, and with strong content, I enjoyed reading to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had never seen before.”
Well, except that in the next paragraph Cameron allegedly described the story of the book according to a 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill out the brief original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a wall in 1991, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, who knew his right-hand manhood, by not knowing the object of the earth.
James himself was not suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron is read as a summary lift of the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville bounded by the wall."
Since he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not get acquainted with the history of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the count, the trees falling down by the industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of his title, Lorax,
Most likely, so relatively little significant PR task was received by an assistant who never read Lorax a child 20 times in a piece.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of neglecting England, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but looking at the team that England has chosen for this tour, I think repeating the 3-0 defeat that she suffered last time in the test series will be unlikely.
Also, I would not rule out the winners.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spine players in this burning set and also collective thinking is strong; they don’t wear scars from 2012, only youth positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the trial series, represents an attacking possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth left the England team in the season-ending series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to ignore Adam Lyth is a tough one for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and a simple, but hard reality is that cricketers are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no questions about Joe Root’s name, which led to the announcement because — as I mentioned earlier — players are their best pickers.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performance was not entirely 100%, and that doesn’t surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much probation time the burner gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you could argue about is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best shape — but this missed opportunity is already a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming and this is a bonfire that I value very positively.
He's an x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
It must be given at least the same opportunity as its predecessors, but all of this will, of course, depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks, was upheld and I have no reservations against it.
I don’t understand why the strokemaker can’t fire and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and the big difference is not.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his appearance in 2001.
It was three centuries ago, and he didn’t even look at it.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he fascinated me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross stats — an average of 31 with a stick and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a goalkeeper, but there aren’t many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors decide for the youth.
There is a lot to learn on this tour.
In addition to the team, England seems to have made a few changes and smart additions to their coaching staff.
Appointment of Mahel Jayawardenea, a Sri Lankan firefighter, as a test match consultant can be a championship move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the white-ball part of the tour and will bring to the team both the energy and the merciless spark.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and just like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the closet, even though they are voices that say consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham teammate Ben Stokes was given a one-day break, as well as Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy stagnates by 2017.
David Cameron’s unthinkable renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets into more problems with every day and without choosing the genius Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to head the Labour Party in Europe, or TUC will take the whole situation to the parade on Tuesday.
Aliens also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their own fault - some Member States already have enough of the British egocentric agenda, splitting concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they would not want it even if they repealed social protection.
We can even call it the Dave and George selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an uncounted Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have gotten to the point where they're not on our way out.
Angela Merkel, the German conservative chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad for her, as was the case with the late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to watch them break their legs with the help of Selfie Brits who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK — something they don’t want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan intentionally useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 referendum campaign in the UK to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"The renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans to their own detriment know how sceptical Fleet Street can be and how sceptical to the EU are the press oligarch barons, because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They can hardly remember the name of Boris Johnson, the eminent Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels-based reporter "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his charisma, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-free givers, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo-foreign departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a freaking gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so she can't have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum routine, since Blair admitted to the principle of the repeal of the EU Constitution, which was flooded by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him an expulsion card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who on Monday in Westminster kindly kicked me in the back - I told him he mustn't waste time on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Murdoch Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of media engagement, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, I will say, evolving.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the horrifying Ukip trend and the wild shores of Tory’s little Englanderism can certainly join in.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was a lot more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" -- Benn's phrase -- apparently wasn't what McDonnell said, or what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, it touched me too - the discipline of the message remains important in the ages of all-day television broadcasting and especially in the faith, paranoia and betrayal that social media are
It’s fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the Labour Party’s support for the referendum campaign as self-evident, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental misconception about EU membership – in line with their Bennite-besieging economy, anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for which narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his twisting about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on Britain’s concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by Bris's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even in reducing the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded of Monday's launch of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise the online review published by Public Health England
The government-funded statement that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking comes from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have connections to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet’s criticism of the evidence used in its report on e-cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "human" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the scope of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An introductory note in the professional magazine Lancet last month attacked an “extraordinarily chatter base” on which the PHE agency based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ questioned the claim that it was allegedly "built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They state that the public could expect that the PHE’s claim, which reads “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking,” is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had previously obtained funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the BAT Public Health Authority in the Sustainability Report, he said.
One of the 12 meeting participants admitted funding from the electronic cigarette maker, but not funding he allegedly obtained earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they supply.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by the tobacco leadership.
The report, which originated in this group, "explicitly admits," missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE claim that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellness at PHE, said the claim at BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we need to continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking and smoking-related diseases, costing the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By emphasizing the current evidence – that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC Should End EastEnders, Says Former Channel 4 Director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting shows such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs, which will likely only be watched by a handful of people, in complex broadcast times over its rivals' biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for six years working on Channel 4.
"I'm fighting the idea that the BBC is entering and broadcasting programs that would certainly have been broadcast to rivals without state input," Johnson said at the Communications Commission in the Upper House as part of the BBC's talks on the future.
If you keep the license fees, which I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced at least as far as programs are concerned that are not produced or implemented by others.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get as much support as possible into the future.
The idea that no one else would send it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, pointless.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded non-contributory.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give them a quiet right hand.
I can't understand what a public broadcasting service these are.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a show businessman who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for reaching ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows echoes those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more sophisticated public service programs "go to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they're fulfilling their powers and can argue when they're going on their hypocritical mission of justifying <0xC2><0xA3>4bn of income that doesn't cost all of the program's license fees."
They broadcast them at a time when no one is looking at them.
As for the license fee, Johnson told the commission: “I urge you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a big sum, but for people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot, I would be surprised if they paid that much because they don’t watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reuters mission in terms of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production was now previously classified as educational - it was 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as an example public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
Speaking about the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which were broadcast on television only a handful, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or the control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses affect the direction in which the ants move.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The tiny ants change direction when they are hit by sound pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.

Scientists have said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activates itself outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian newspaper that one day this method could replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the patient's intestinal tracts are injected with electrodes that stimulate the brain.
The eardrums usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would occur when placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that then pass through the body of worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves act in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the anesthesia using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where the modified motor neurons turned on.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, made it clear that sonogenesis could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly into the brain.
“We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would find its application even in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements embarrassing the British arms trade.
Take a look at the video on the anti-arms market from Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drones!
The eyes on the legs that break the ankles!
Shotguns!
And electric smudges that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and caricature of the metaphor leave no one in doubt that this advertisement at the world’s largest weapons fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to the repressive regimes of the International Centre of Defense and Security.

But a separate campaign is also led by the emergence of posters at bus stops and meters, which require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using a letter with the London Underground markings with the DLR lines becomes the image of the tank.
This September, the day of arms dealers will descend on the DLR...Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are made by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is <0xC2><0xA3>6 per piece of Allen key, which is said to "get access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the collective Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show off-gallery political activity to viewers.
Many artists switch to work with activists within the protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the arms trade the health of passengers in the subway.
The video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without a fee, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the advertisements about the arms trade – he saw the vacant spot on the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s show them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They were playing with creating more realistic risky corporate ads, but "by adding a lot of color and animation, I've realized that more people will be attracted to it."
“They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair,” said Tom Davies.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action to ensure that torture facilities are not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military on the "shoulder of the AT4CS RS."
This includes a "single-shaped head that provides amazing effects behind the armour inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
8 Golden Rules for Living in a College Student
Eleven years ago, I moved to college as an obnoxious nineteen-year-old boy, still believing in barter and moral relativism, but until now I'm getting the strained smiles of those I've struggled with - and the numerous, long-lasting grievances of others.
Everything I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the rails can range from mildly on the nerves of the walker to completely shocking.
It's tempting to fool around: to tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what your opinion of Corbyn is, and why "you honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe as well - ask and express interest.
It manages the conversation and will help you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn’t have fun with even if your eyelashes were in one fire and they would issue fire extinguishers.
Let me make room.
People’s rooms often change to drinking receptions, movie night spots, and communal public places, but they’re also rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.

Introverts will be coming to high school soon.
Your room should be a haven, yet many neighborhoods are turning into an out-of-the-box walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It could be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to find out when your classmate is tired of socializing – and maybe write to him instead of clapping.
When it comes to tapping, tap.
A guy in my queues used to say that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you started going to college on top of a baking mania, knocking on a foreign door and performing with a plate of baked cakes seems a little less strange, less like, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile as you wake up."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and perhaps everything will end up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
Of course, that's the point of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and starch will likely make others pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime on college campuses.
Theft of whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea a theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're squeezed inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate, who exchanged her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, but you’re also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could quiet the drum and bass a little, because they were 3 at night and she had a letter in the morning.
The answer was to amplify the music.
When they were finally silenced at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours and then left her own music loud, locked the door, and left for her three-hour lettering.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future cottage went on the same tracks as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn’t it be terribly embarrassing if you mistake your roommates for your future cottage, sleep together, break up, and have to see each other every day, and maybe take control of your common friends?
Of course, you won’t recommend the heart – but if your sexy roommate isn’t 100% your future mansion, try talking to your weaknesses at least a little bit.
At an elevating moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unenclosed room, there is only a thin line between the funny and the chick.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something from them - never brush someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put their keys in a bottle of water, which you then put in the freezer - but never glue their stuff to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva has had a rough time already during her pregnancy with a seven-year-old girl.
His father broke up with her and the grandson was alone in preparing and raising her.
I coped with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and looking for a positive in it.
Uncertainty and being alone with the baby, I tried not to bother.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn’t be alone for long, remembers Eva today about her first pregnancy.
Already at that time, she met on the internet at the chat of the older Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka, with whom they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek even brought Eva and V<0xC3><0xAD>tek home from the nursery, but he didn’t get too caught up in the role of his stepdad.
"For a while, he dropped out of the show," Eva said in the documentary series Four in Volume 3.
The theme of the third series of the Czech TV series is the search for happiness for the second attempt.
V<0xC3><0xAD>tka’s care and financial security of the family were managed thanks to part-time work and the great help of the mother and the help of the aunt.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child did not ultimately spoil Va<0xC5><0xA1>kov’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around V<0xC3><0xAD>tk’s second birthday and he now understands Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka as his father and so does he.
Even though Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek already has two grown-up daughters, paternity at sixty enjoys its words and is also more devoted to children.
In addition to V<0xC3><0xAD>tka, two-year-old Leont<0xC3><0xBD>nka and eventually twins were added to them.
“Your father has come into our family in such a natural way, perhaps even because my mother never spoke to me much about relationships,” Eva thinks smiling.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born with a cesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of a pregnant woman and are manifested especially by itching.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn fetus, which is threatened by premature birth and death, in the mother after birth usually spontaneously departs.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Evin and Va<0xC5><0xA1>ko, even though they were only at 36 weeks.
The emi<0xC4><0x8D>ka was placed in an incubator at the intermediary department, where Va<0xC5><0xA1>kov’s niece also works, who managed to take over and house it.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after transferring from JIP to the room I had her with me, describes a challenging period after the birth of Eva.
She spent 20 days in the maternity hospital until doctors allowed her to release the baby, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for the children in the nursery, however, did not make Eve happy.
“I was crazy about my husband and children,” recalls the six-week-old four-year-old mother at the difficult moments of separation.
She and her husband also considered signing the reverse, among other things because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen in the end and the doctors let Eva and her twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and childbirth are broadcast by <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A large family is able to shrink.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with the electric double-deck and tight conditions.
Although the house did not increase, Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make cooking for six people more comfortable.
When it's bad, we'll trade for a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially family comfort and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or debauchery of the house.
For the time being, we were getting along very well, better than we expected.
Although the disorder is worse hidden in a small space and the wetting baby is sometimes overcome, but at least we are all close, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side for every situation.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ko's work of lighting in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That’s why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, how long will he be physically able to take care of the finances of his family and children?
“I realize that, given our age difference, it will one day be me who will feed this family,” Eva admits to the level when asking about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of owning her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly a burden to the employer.
And when it's the worst, my husband and I can exchange for a cab, a nice blonde joking.
Apple has the Jo-Jo effect.
They can use screens for anything.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a firmer chassis, or a touch-recognizing display are the shortcuts of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend has been that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, the weight of which increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in favor of the news was really negligible.
This is far from the case with new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for the smaller model and by 20 grams for the larger model.
On the one hand, one cannot be surprised, last year’s affair by bending in Apple’s pockets treated a lot.
The new chassis is thus made of a more durable 7000 aluminum alloy, which also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology in the news, thanks to which the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to equip the display with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhones’ displays has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from the original 12 grams to 29 grams, then in the case of a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest component used.
The weight of just 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty thanks to the degreasing rinse, which touched most of the remaining components.
For the larger model, the battery is the heaviest element used, but its weight has not changed in any way compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is visible right at the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
The extent to which the new display technology will be practical, it will be manifested only when used.
First users will be able to try it as early as Friday, September 25, when sales of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will begin in selected countries.
Have you had breakfast chips for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have managed to find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from various periods, including wall paintings, remnants of tools, and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which is dated to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that is very reminiscent of the remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oatmeal were found on the spot, which apparently went through the production process of such popular flakes today.
With it, the grains are wetted first today, then dry, remove the packaging, so-called pluche, then burn and dissolve in general.
In the Paglici cave, grains were discovered, which were supposedly heated or burned, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least evidence of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, the scientists were unable to prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that a complete process of fleas production was taking place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and quite possibly even warm, of course, is offered quite logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting evidence of how intensively people used cereals long before the creation of agriculture.
In fact, if the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes preceded agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
New reports of stations in the Transport Company of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the reports of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnus<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova, P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>zrak, Fr<0xC3><0xA1>zova, Sprateck<0xC3><0xA1>.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so reporting in a male voice was a bit less understandable than before when stops were reported in a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper traffic noise is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this voter was chosen by the passengers themselves - I do not know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose it from the studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for a good couple of decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops to remember, so I do not need this report, but foreigners from abroad, who do not recognize themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are not intended to be used in the first place, they can be confused in the second place, and they can finally be confused in the second place.
Perhaps the choice of the speaker - but better the speakers again - should be made again, and this time sub-colored by the usual traffic noise and engine noise, in which the purchase of the speaker in the bus is almost lost.
So that we no longer have to listen to the names of the stations Vodn<0xC3><0xAD> Her<0xC5><0xA1>pice, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>rova, or Ponorn<0xC3><0xA1> in the creeping shalina, to which I moved in Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rov.
I guess my old-fashioned hearing didn't get all of a sudden worse on the one day when the speaker of the stops changed.
Before that day, I had quite a good understanding of these reports.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the tracker's notes.
Today, few people know which of the party’s governments the largest and smartest were the so-called comprehensive audits.
I've allowed myself to remember it.
The bus was late.
I hit the dispatcher's office the moment it was on the radio it was just seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't meet your comrade chief, he came a minute ahead of you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher remarked as I entered the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll take care.
You write to me that I'm going through the circuits at a minor mechanization audit.
It won't work, it's auditions today.
They're all fucked up, to the point of horror.
What's this about?
"You'll see," whispered the dispatcher.
Next time you'll be too.
I ran into the hallway.
Then the door of the headquarters opened, and the chief appeared.
Drunk, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling equinox.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, and quickly turned on the two buttons of the pocket at the same time.
'Good morning, 'said the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor, not realizing the cold, evil tone to which the old replied.
'You're playing, 'said the engineer Eva, an elderly lady whom I highly esteemed.
She said she was even the chief of staff before her comrades took over.
There's checks, and you're gonna make it.
How many times have I asked you what these complex audits are, but no one wants to talk about them too much.
They say they are once every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'm sure I'll see.
I pulled out the file with the periodic reports and the phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice answered.
What's poisoning?
Now we met and nothing ..." I muttered, but no one answered me, everyone with their own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I have come at your command," I retorted, barely entering the headquarters.
The chief sat at the desk and looked at some of the sheets.
"I don't like your behavior at all," said the judge, mechanizer, for a moment, without raising his head and still looking carefully at the board.
He threw the tablecloth on the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared at me with an ordinary, unpleasant, nasty, piercing look.
I'm not sure.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised me for having worked very well in the office over the last few months and for being very pleased with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at a distance.
What about this?
Realize that you're a track-distance technician and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting that you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I felt that I had been using such a greeting since I was a child, that I was raised so that I didn’t see anything wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red cloth for a croquette.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work," the head of state said.
And besides, you're still messing with the superiors.
One day you'll say "sir" and the other you'll say "judgment."
But I'm not a Mr. Chief for you, I'm a Comrade Chief.
The comrades are the comrades the comrades the comrades the comrades the comrades the comrades the comrades the comrades the comrades the comrades!
Remember that, please!
I'm sorry, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I've greeted you with ordinary civic greetings.
There's nothing wrong with that... and that honor to work, or a comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," said the chief, who, meanwhile, calmed down a little.
There will be talk of it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid pension on that chair up there.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn’t his preference, it didn’t look good with the person concerned.
For a moment he looked at me with a cold, piercing look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I also felt his elevated sneezing.
He was only a few years older, and he played the godfather, actually the godfather.
Zoological, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, as he was right now.
They all went to him.
Come on, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-partisans, pushed him.
But the chieftain struck many, especially those to whom he could apply his supremacy.
He just kicked me in the ass.
I was thinking something about his ass, and it cost me enough to get over it so I wouldn't shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the crumb, let alone to continue as a railing officer.
What would I like to have two kids?
And for that, a bartender set up!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
'That's all, you can go, 'said the chief, and began again to look carefully at the plate he had previously in his hand.
They called me at half-twelve.
Everyone in the office was already there and to the questions of what and how, they answered that yes, that would be good.
It was only Jo<0xC5><0xBE>in who spoke, as was his custom, that we could not all be thrown out, for the work would have to be done by the comrade-in-chief himself with his faithful, and that there was no danger.
The word "judgment" underlined, as if he knew what the old man had left for me this morning.
There was a nice meeting at the headquarters.
The comrade-chief at his desk and at the long advisory table, other comrades who had to decide whether or not I should be an official.
Stafford, chairman of the ROH, staff reporter, special purpose reporter, some sort of military counter-attack, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from scratch.
Ordinary railroad worker, shoved down a fork or threw a gravel with his forks.
But also a former guard.
It was heard that there was no fun with him at the time, said a pretty beast.
Bad language claims that he went out of school in the seventh grade, he learned nothing, he didn't know anything.
And when the criminal was canceled, he ended up at the stake at the crook.
But comrade, yes, the comrade was minted!
The chief told me to sit down.
There was a little snail in me, an inexhaustible snail in my neck.
C<0xC3><0xA1>drov<0xC3><0xA1>k read the assessment from the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I am married, I have two children and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then the judgment from the street organization of the party.
He copied the judgement from the Civil Committee, maybe both were written by the same man.
But then it came!
The parents of long-time members of the party refused to appear before the audit committee and subsequently resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The clerk noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief said he was going to continue.
It was only worse now.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and there I was selected as a candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents who stepped out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding in the church, in addition to the National Committee.
I've disappointed the party's confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was ousted from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I had a church funeral, even though she was a former member of the party.
With all this, I show a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the watchman read, only the tapping of the chief's pencil into the table top interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was looking at me, and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
I kept repeating myself in the spirit of "Communists - superstitious, communists - superstitious." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the smiths?
I could fix the outages without any fucking checks.
But now?
The career of a railroad official took over before it began.
Back to the squad?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief will leave me for an hour.
"Judge, how did you examine the comrade under discussion here?" interrupted the chief, tensely, with a question to the staffer.
Well, according to a judgement from a previous job.
Do you have it here?
The cadrev<0xC3><0xA1>k obviously wasn’t overdue.
On the abbreviations of the cramped sweat, he sneezed nervously, as if he had himself been checked.
He grinned fiercely and gave the chief some paper.
"No," said the chief, with a hint of ferocity, which was often the prelude to the storm.
At first glance, praise itself, taught with honors, studied pr<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0x9B>mysl<0xC3><0xB3>wka, worked in the task salaries as a castlekeeper, met the norm on average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get the judgment, comrade?" he turned again to the staffer, who felt that it was beginning to turn against him, and that he might not be a staffer very soon.
This is where my comrade gave it to me at the entrance.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the district to the squadron," said the blacksmith.
And there's no need for judgements, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were included in the technical function, this piece of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The man was nervous and had no answer at all.
"It's all right, we'll talk about it later," the chief concluded, and the staffer was obviously relieved.
He's stopped it for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden, it's over!
My eyes were dark, my eyes were hot.
There followed a surge of resentment and accusations, and I knew that I was the most repulsive creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by undermining an incomplete judgement, I misled a fellow staff rapporteur, and I did not understand why the judgement was incomplete when I received it from a factory staffer.
I am also an anti-socialist who, at the time of the construction of real socialism, supports the regimes of religious obscurity, even participates in them.
That, there was a lot of things I did, or maybe I was still doing, and I prayed quietly that it would end.
I didn't care.
I didn't care to fly out of the mechanic's place.
I didn't care if they took that cripple.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people as I was in the eyes of a fellow chief.
"That would suffice, comrade chief," the leader of the party said suddenly, and sharply interrupted the chief's lefties.
The comrade here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What's wrong, he's made a straight fool!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, comrade chief!
What could be worse for a young man than closing the door to his side for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is it so summed up or parroted phrases from party training and meetings?
That is why this young fellow must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's to give it to him, if not you, comrade chief?
It's your duty to support this young, right, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to correct!
It's your side duty that no one's gonna get rid of!
In fact, it is a side duty for all of us.
Here the comrade must see that the side did not forget him.
That as a kind mother she not only punishes, but that she also loves.
When the president was finished, no one was silent.
No one expected such a turnaround.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, comrade-president," the chief said ice-coldly in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me make a deal, you'd hear I'm heading towards a conclusion like that.
They all nodded their heads in agreement, but it was on them that they did not believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the role of an independent fund-raiser," I whispered as I returned to the office, and in turn I cried.
Luckily, except for the engineer, Eva, they were all at lunch.
The silence listened to my incoherent makeup of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked if I could have a coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the stove and made pots.
In the meantime, she was talking about cadres practices.
As one judgment, often full of praise, they put a man in hand, and the other, in which there is some dirt, they send to the new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had it, but I did end up at the shovel near the crumb, so the fellows from the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our cadres?
He's just getting old, where he'd eat or drink, and that's how it ended up.
"He hides it from the old one," she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Keep an eye out for him, he's quite vengeful.
And the party president?
Basically, a far worse chief, no folktale.
Zero from a cripple with a lot of power.
The water on the coffee began to boil, and in turn the office filled with the smell of just sour coffee.
I put a sugar cube in the bowl and quietly mixed a hot liquorice.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
I'm not getting fired now, and the other audits are only in three years.
Anyway, my comrade chief won't forget that day.
Published in the anthology of LITERATURE ON TRATI II by EPIKA
The symbol of the village was revived.
The windshield wheel above Chlum rotates again after years.
It can be seen from afar, because it is located on a fifteen-meter high tower.
The people around him call him the "Chlum fan."
For the village of 150 inhabitants, it has even become one of the elements of the municipal sign, which the village acquired on the occasion of the clash of relatives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone in the area knows it," said Mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a reminder of the present: it reminds us of a time when locals fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries has been a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that Chlum’s representatives decided on a solution, which was then suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch on <0xC4><0x8C>i<0xC4><0x8D>ov, a seven-metre-deep well was dug.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal construction with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the church.
"The construction was carried out by Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Kunc from Hranic in Moravia at a cost of 2,400 kroner," says a memorial inscription on the ground floor fence of the tower construction.
The pump after several repairs and falls of the wind turbine was extended in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the fight for water began to be written: on that day a new plumbing began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a non-functional common symbol and a local rarity.
The dominance was carried out during this year's clash of natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlum<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xAD> decided to repair the wind turbine again and put it back into operation.
They had to make a replica of the original wheel - reduced in diameter by half a meter.
The bike was installed on the stand, but had to be taken down the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the right material and the bike was not able to withstand wind gusts.
Then the Chlum dominant rested for several years disassembled under the roof.
However, since June this year, the wheel on the high tower has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the encounter of the natives, the village had the replica of the wheel modified and settled it again on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well only to the attacking blind shoulder.
And over the summer we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty-handed.
"In the fall, we will disconnect the shaft of the wind turbine from the pump in the vacuum basket again," Mayor Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind turbine has reached the municipal mark, but it is the only one of its kind in the whole of Vysocina.
They have a similar element in the sign in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovici and Zelena Hora in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko, in Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsko, in Partutovice in P<0xC5><0x99>erovsko or in the Police in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>nsko.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafatu, she confessed to Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," Goian, 34, smiled at a pre-match press conference.
At the time, George Hagi was training us, it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope I'm going to score for Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
It is this man who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team that is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the assaults of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says Spartan Hyb<0xC5><0xA1> about the Greek struggle.
And partly he knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataie well, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their matches.
“I know he’s a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta too,” Goian said.
The other footballers of the Prague club did not mention it, so the direct question arose whether he also knows David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and looked at Czech journalists with a slightly countable look.
A vague expression on his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teams.
He has really good players.
The Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
That's what the Spartans know about Goian.
"My experience from larger clubs, it can be said that they are defending Asteras, that is their organizer of the game," said Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has the best years in his life, but he can boast a very interesting football biography.
Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City were interested in him at the time, but from Steauy he moved to Palermo in Italy, he also played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We are waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, pens for victory in the Czech league.
It’s a favorite for me in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am at peace with the Slovak goalkeeper Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD>, who is very pleased with the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Yeah, me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofol in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading of the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the Group’s headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on the company’s performance, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, financial director of Kofola Group.
"In connection with the relocation of the headquarters, the shareholders of the group are considering placing the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry on the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the securities prospectus, which will be submitted by the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding’s head office and related share transfers will take the form of a non-public transaction with the participation of only existing shareholders.
As a result, no shares will be offered to the public or to new investors under this transaction.
"An offer of shares to new investors would be made - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said in a statement.
The company has already stated in the past that a possible offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a stock offer on the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of the objectivity of Czech Television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the reports of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time broadcasting the main news session of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they are taught at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can broadcast today’s Czech Television Event.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the broadcasting of intelligence.
It was not until the first minute when the Czech Republic informed about the turmoil on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on policemen euphemistically called them patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), that the current pro-migrant propaganda was already going - judge for yourself.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children at Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as an opportunity.
Traveling fugitives - <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses the terms fugitive or fugitive and not migrant.
What is particularly striking is that <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses only pictures of young children and women in illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Conclusion: For the most part, propaganda that does not have periods of communist agitation.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once grew up in a paneled apartment, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
I've been moved to the Umkart toilet by the fisherman.
Fish domestic, insect with imperfect transformation, i.e., not permeating that transition from a bush to a beak and young looks like an adult individual, only is small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't want to lose them.
First, manually and then chemically.
The socialist drugstores provided some blue crystals to eliminate them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or some other way?
However, it was eliminated successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in the same way.
A box with some juvenalizer that the ants brought to their nest and he then refused to allow the queen to generate a new offspring.
But I turned it off.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and more and more I adhered to the view that they have the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from my life that intervening in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another.
The truth about fleas and ticks, I don't think I'd repeat myself to make my karma worse by killing them.
In the new residence, we agreed with our partner that if the fisherman doesn’t climb our neck, they should eat the plums of fallen skin, some of the invisible algae and the like.
Their peaceful existence over time was disrupted by the spider.
It was a common type of snail that had long sat on the ceiling.
We thought he lived from occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he spent several years with us, we found that he mainly feeds on fish and that their number apparently kept on a bearable count.
Through regular confidential contact, we have found that it is a female when every need is met.
In fact, we were witnessing romantic encounters with a partner about a third less, how carefully he crawled on the fibers of the spider, so that it would not be eaten before it reached the desired copulation.
It took about three days when they didn't move and didn't even respond to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of the dried female next to the female.
After that, the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging out around her.
They'll be gone soon.
The work was eaten by my mother, and the work was scattered elsewhere.
Even the girl disappeared somewhere for a week.
We don't know if she's gone or died, but after a month or two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that predator in the toilet.
For some time, she carefully watched our behavior from the ceiling and, as she moved under the toilet bowl, evaluated our non-attack as friendship.
The number of slightly multiplicated fish ponds decreased again, and the spider quietly looked at his usual activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn’t changed all year.
Our daughter, meanwhile, reached an age when using a nightstand was already a shame.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already taken hold.
We have been increasingly encouraging her to use the toilet.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to keep her bad habit in the spider, which she could see very well when wiping.
Our talk about that spider to see, luck in the house did not take at all.
Crying and screaming, she forced her nightgown.
There was nothing left.
There came a time when the spider had to crawl in order to move the daughter.
It's up to me.
He was taken into a glass and put out through a balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him like a friend, but after so long living together, I felt as if I were throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fish will start to appear more often and will start to multiply by a geometric series.
The world is amazing, a week, two, none of us showed up there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider hadn't grown them in the pattern of ants, that the toilet environment wasn't as good for their existence as we thought.
Then, however, the first medium-sized pieces appeared, and they were already blackened.
I had to come up with a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their connection to the spider had to have a reason that when they didn't see it, it was hidden somewhere else and they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, perhaps, they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his rapid disappearance in them triggered some alarming reaction.
I don’t make any illusions about their eyes.
They showed some light flattery, but that they would react to wavering hands or quick movements, it did not.
My daughter goes to the bathroom on a regular basis.
I think she's already forgotten about the napkin.
All you have to do is attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish to the ether, and I hope they haven't ignored me after that execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use Cyclone B.
The Ten Words of Albert Einstein That Enriched the World
The words of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to immerse himself in everything so deeply that the outcome was always an astonishing finding.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He first came to the people’s consciousness with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
Nor can his explanation of the photo effect or the idea of the quantization of the electromagnetic field be neglected.
There is no doubt that the description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so messy for many that it prefers easy directions for closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it wouldn’t have been Albert Einstein if he hadn’t found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: The watch near your beloved seems like a minute; the minute in a hot oven seems like an hour – and that’s relativity.
I have allowed myself to choose from his entire pleiade of famous quotes these ten that literally captured me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius tries not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No number of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one who can prove me wrong at any time.
But it is a sad period when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, then what reflects the empty table?
I don't know what they're going to fight in World War III, but in World War IV they're going to be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous, and to know a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem on which my life depended, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive not bringing Einstein's formula to the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula is: A<0x3D>X<0x2B>Y<0x2B>Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is to keep your tongue behind your teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n Region are expecting 1.5 billion changes.
"It's a success, considering that all four are held in black numbers all this year," said heitman Stanislav Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>k.
The total profit of the regional facilities at this time is about 32 million kroner.
The share in this is mainly higher than the premiums from the insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> and Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, thanks to this, the construction will cost almost 1.5 billion kroner.
The long period in which we mainly bought the appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, state-of-the-art healthcare can not be done, the regional deputy health minister Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as explained the plans.
We are looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
Builders will be coming to hospitals next year.
In Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now selecting for almost 300 million kroner.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> they have a planned port of dialysis.
Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> in Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> wants to add a new interior for about 200 million to the central pavilion opened this year.
And the hospital in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n Ba<0xC5><0xA5>ova is waiting for a long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internship, which will need three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, both patients and doctors," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prouskov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the hospital in V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prouskov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The five-storey building there is to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for the interior and neurology, dialysis, a new ambulance, a bed and a unit of intensive care.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which are significantly recognized by patients, affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, they only need one toilet on the floor, the beds are inexhaustible, the windows are not sealed and the health workers do not have adequate conditions for work.
“For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and now it is on the limit of its life,” said Pavel Calabek, director of Zlin Hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model already has a half-finished Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
The central income already stands and will be added internally within three years.
"We will pay the building from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sl<0xC3><0xA1>dek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
The profit is still the highest and was not lost even two years ago, when the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital, for example, suffered a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajd<0xC3><0xA1>k, who is in charge of the economy.
Improvements are also expected for patients at the Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> hospital.
Over the next ten to fifteen years, repairs, new equipment and reconstructions will cost up to half a billion kroner.
Already this year, the repair of the capture station will be completed, then the construction of dialysis will begin, or the construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one has explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that the other Czech states are pushing for acceptance of quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We have not received an answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you have taken at the meetings of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as with a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they redistribute themselves.
We can't imagine it.
We have not received an answer, and we therefore wanted quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. places of registration, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about it for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We've dealt with forty thousand recently, and now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of the people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as the destination country, are going to get asylum from us, but the interest of people from this wave of migration, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is very close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't even want to come to us, but we've already made a commitment to accept fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn’t it be possible to take more of them this way?
We're committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even with the 1,500, there will be 1,100 people to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we treat those we've captured.
It is a big question, and we will be debating with Europe whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may happen that we do not even keep the 1100 on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany when they arrive.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98% of the European statistics say they get international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel through Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there's four hundred people here who'll move in.
This is the second project that is still under way, and there we have only made progress in debating with the churches about the possibility of helping them get jobs, housing, and so on.
But it's a run on a very long track.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss the ministerial talks with us.
Is it not, however, that the Czech Republic simply rejects the quotas, but does not offer any solidarity step that would unblock this discussion?
And what exactly do you think is a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany says that all migrants from Syria can come to them, the message will be circulated in hours across all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This is triggering another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they just don’t want to come to us.
We think the path is to protect the external borders - just deter those migratory waves, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Let them know that they don’t have a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, courts, state prosecutors.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or only accept them according to the needs of the economies, then those fifty percent of what social systems spend on them in vain today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day was twelve.
How far will it go in order to tighten up border controls?
We were afraid of arresting hundreds of people.
These are the numbers that we can handle.
We still have a few hundred vacant places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be returning to Austria within seven days.
We do it as standard.
Experienced people are the only ones who take us, with Hungary it’s complicated, and the Greeks – it’s a completely useless story.
So where is the breaking point?
Does it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it should be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, we're depleting enough capacity to come up with crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation were to occur, the government could sit down de facto immediately, and by one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police about the army, let's call it the customs administration, or the prison service.
The final variant is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can get that far to us.
Bear in mind that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I do not want to disseminate alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to deflect the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct trip to Austria.
It would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of her debts at the last minute.
It is trying to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid off the debts.
The footballers also got their money.
On Tuesday, Slavia was suspended for the first time due to insolvency proceedings.
Nearly three months after the proposal was made by Samoa’s Pacific-based company Online Services for about CZK 20 million.
Slavia lawyer Zuzana Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> tried to convince judge Michaela Wenzlov<0xC3><0xA1> within a few hours that she did not have to declare a fall over Slavia.
Needless to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week the new owner of Slavie was the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>im<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B>.
Apparently, money came from the new owners to the club at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia’s statement before Tuesday’s trial – the top club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent in debt tens of millions of kroner.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," said Slavie Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1>, a lawyer.
Who did Slavia pay?
For both current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivanov or the Czech backup Mari Li<0xC4><0x8D>kov.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenicke.
On Friday, the club also paid dues for the Prague 10 district.
As part of the insolvency dispute, de facto only claims which Slavie contradicts remain.
Either according to the club, the commitments did not arise at all, or there are legal disputes about them.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can prove by debit from the account," Mladkov<0xC3><0xA1> told a judge.
"Everything that was after maturity is paid," Ml<0xC3><0xA1>dkov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that only invalid or contradictory commitments were not paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid off the debts.
All the evidence will then be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected at the earliest in November.
The judge ordered the hearings to continue on November 3rd.
However, the decision will not be taken at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X enables welding with state-of-the-art welding processes developed by Kemppi to ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
There is no waste of time and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty quarrels.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less space, more welding and higher profit.
It is a novelty this year, which had its premiere in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these compliments very much, as they confirm the exceptionalness of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is at the world’s top.
For those who are interested, there are also pleasant delivery times, which range around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already made the first contacts, which will certainly continue to expand after the Brno fair.
We have been regular participants for more than twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, emphasizes ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
The blanket was to be built so that it would not fall apart.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
It’s even safer to clean the blanks, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there would not be two landslides in Prague’s Stromovce, says the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
He said it on Wednesday night during a press tour of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion kroner more expensive.
It will be open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and safety.
"The tunnel was going to be broken safer, but the costs are increasing exponentially," Butovi<0xC4><0x8D> said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovce were the same all along, yet the country fell just a few steps away from where it began to be broken by a safer and more careful method.
"If the measure had been used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovce, in 2010 the ground collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav director Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told Euro.
The building was originally intended to cost 17 billion kroner.
If we add to this the VAT, which doubled during the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
Adding to this technology, land purchases and engineering, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer from the 37, B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, reduction in fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported dissatisfied results over the last quarter and a huge reduction in its annual earnings forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a 20 cent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 percent, which will be reflected in January. 4, and higher land freight or large parcel surcharges starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman of the Board and CEO of Fred Smith said that the company "presented solid performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade," the company said in a statement.
The holiday rental plans were announced the day after rival UPS said it plans to hire an additional 90,000 to 95,000 workers, which is about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenues rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping, causing revenues in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx land unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but operating profits were essentially the same due to higher prices for larger parcels and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher base rates, while profits fell in the freight trade due to higher labor prices. The express unit reported higher incomes due to higher base rates.
In pre-market trading about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with an 11 percent year-on-year decline and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, the Federal Reserve legislators will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table and deciding whether after nearly a decade it’s time to raise the key interest rate.
Hanging above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a double mandate from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor too close to a predictable decision to be announced on Thursday as to whether the US economy is ready to kick-start with the discontinuation of an unprecedented stimulus in 2008 in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates.
While most data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed over adding to instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds – even by no more than a percentage point per line.
"It is clear that the labour and inflation market will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with enough justification to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is a cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises the rates, only if politicians soften the collapse by promising that the next increase is unforeseeable.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would keep rates quiet this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the rates now,” he says.
If the Fed politicians did, “they would have to go to the extremes in their program statement and hold the financial markets in their hands so as not to panic.”
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer she expects an increase in rates this year, despite complaints from liberals, that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level the Fed considers full-time employment.
Wage earnings showed signs of a rise.
And while inflation continues to run below the annual 2% target of the central bank, Fed politicians say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to blunt at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record high in May, as investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would pull down global growth.
The market has shrunk slightly this month and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of its May peak.
The Fed’s uneasy market situation provides a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising the interest rate.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA's Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former official at Fein.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and they have hardly any data to rely on about the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
A mere indication by then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “sweep” their monetary expansion in the market, triggering convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Wealth-Management Strategy at Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policymaking, which pushed for an increase in rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75% during three meetings “despite the limited identifiable impacts on growth in the US,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed the cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize concerns about financial stability during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England.
The latest tremor is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rate growth because markets are getting angry,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's the Chinese Quarter, not the Thai Quarter.
The Market/Store is the only point of contact that offers an astonishing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need some engine oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour before you cross all the alleys.
If you’re hungry for all this shopping, go for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal commercial stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and lots of items are sold in bulk.
Among the fresh products are special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the employees behind the counter will wash you and bite you, even fried you, if you wish,
A good part of the shop is left to a massive freezing section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, free-sale and other half-food items.
Who is shopping here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
The wide alleys meet the shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh moonhong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial area of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of the Chinese Quarter and centers - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to do so when it agreed to an amendment to the Senate, which rejected the speed increase.
The new law on land communications will now be addressed to the president.
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said at the end of April that the law would veto a speed limit of one hundred and ten kilometers.
The Minister of Transport Dan <0xC5><0xA4>ok (for ANO) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech highway network is not yet built at such a speed.
On Tuesday, he supported the Senate version of the law in front of the MP.
The approved novel will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-stroke ones.
The House first extended this option to highways, which could be used in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
Members have now moved on to his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also removed the permission of the transport police to have the final say when regulating local communications that are taken care of by the municipalities.
The Senate version, approved by the House, also counts on the possibility to store sewers, plumbing or public lighting cables longitudinally under the surface of the carriages.
This would save the towns for the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The novella is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle vehicles that owners do not report to.
Newly, municipalities could sell withdrawn vehicles, which are not notified by their owners within six months of the notification of withdrawal.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of fines for shipping companies.
The novel also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of existing paper ones, which will also be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The mouthpiece expressor goes to court.
He threatens 10 years for the over-welcome of the citizens.
The case relates to the allegedly oversimplified Citizens’ Welcome project.
The police wanted to prosecute MEP Zuzana Kailov<0xC3><0xA1> (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to the legal qualification of the case, the two are at risk of up to ten years in prison.
The main makeup is scheduled for two days in October.
According to prosecutor Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k and Mac<0xC3><0xAD>k, they caused damages of at least one million kroner, according to the prosecution.
The plaintiff relies on an expert judgment.
Former members of the city’s management, according to the plaintiff from the title of their office, unlawfully allowed to obtain the property benefit of the company, which organized the welcome of the citizens.
According to the charges, Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k ordered the then head of the Magistrate’s Department of Urban Services, Education and Culture to address five related companies in the selection process.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, signed up for the competition, the town hall cancelled the competition.
The city was then to entrust the order to the administrator, and only Darothera entered into the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges led in order to ensure for Darothere the award of a public contract to hold the event Welcome to the citizens of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem in a long and coordinated manner acted at least in contravention of the requirement for a procedure for the care of the proper economy, writes the State Representative.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that after obtaining this contract, Darothore subsequently invoices <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem for the implementation of the Citizens’ Welcome event a price which will be disproportionately increased against the real value of the services actually provided.
Within three years, the company reportedly collected more than CZK 5 million for the project.
The city eventually paid only one share, about 1.7 million kroner, and then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was overdrafted by at least one million kroner.
Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k had previously rejected any violations of the law.
I didn't commit any crime. I'm innocent.
I do not understand this case, said the former mayor before, with the fact that the city under his leadership was only committed to a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was hosted by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," added Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The criminals originally wanted to accuse Ms Kailov, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the House of Representatives did not sue her.
The criminals therefore postponed the case in her case, but they count on Kailo to be charged after her term of office expires.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers were given a gift voucher for 5 thousand crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police have reportedly released a fugitive dog.
Then they forced the reporters to delete the record.
Hungarian police have briefly detained a cameraman of the AP agency on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a record on which a police dog allegedly crashed into the refugee’s land.
The Hungarian government, however, is questioning this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the maize field near the Hungarian city of Röszke crossing the border with Serbia.
The police took action against the refugees, and one of them let a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his chin.
The dog of the man who shouted, "Please, please, I am a refugee," said Muzi.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything, one of the police officers noticed and did not let him leave.
The reporter was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The police took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of the two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zolt<0xC3><0xA1>n Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs.
The conduct of police officers in the incident was unacceptable, saying that journalists should be able to cover up events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying legally acquired material.
Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs challenged Muzi’s police report on the making of events.
He said the cops just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force anything to lure him.
"Dogs can bite - they're trained to deter and incite a little fear, but they certainly don't attack," Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
City wins us, Juventus believes
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," Manuel Pellegrini, the City coach, said.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Not a single team has created a lot of opportunities, but we had the ball on our feet for a long time.
"The reason for the defeat was not tactical, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team cashed in in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of last season Juventus was exactly the opposite before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, as a defender, the title has only a point and with a score of 2:4 is only 16th on the table.
The visit to the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will hit us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three opponents before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
Pogba, Mand<0xC5><0xBE>uki<0xC4><0x8D> and Morata were represented in Manchester.
"That's right, this victory is very important, maybe thanks to it we'll get on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking phase.
This result is deserved by my players.
"We could have scored 0:2 before our clearing goal, but Gianluigi supported us," coach Allegri praised Buffon's goalkeeper.
"We've burned a few good chances," said Yayu Tourého, City's backer.
We have to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Farewell to Angela, Farewell to Old Germany II.
Before we proceed on the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that all this media turmoil around is controlled by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also the nurse.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, the newspapers and media are full of children who carry on their parents’ arms after the dusty paths of the exodus.
And this automatically triggers a sense of guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they don’t come here just desperate babies, notice on the footage of the landing boats to the Greek islands that the baby is not so much visible on them!
Well, somehow we've been missing pictures of ships heading for Lampedusa, fugitives from the French border at Menton, whose beautiful promenades are landing thousands of young men.
Most of the young blacks.
And also missing pictures of Callais, where these are eating and black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I guess he doesn't care anymore.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
It's too much of a fake.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow hidden that it is not only the unfortunate children from Syria, but also the outcasts - for the elderly: fashionably outcast - young men.
Their muscles look like they've just come out of some fitness center.
Only one personal experience for that.
This summer in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on a private beach hotel.
Despite being private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no ham.
And young black men came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in branded clothes and shoes. In their hands, by the way, smartphones.
The fact that it was a private beach did not interest them, and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They occupied all the deckchairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was right in the sea, was lucky.
They were dressed like from an American rapper movie.
On the heads of a hat with a nail, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they grabbed the local beach bar and started to hunt.
They sat around the tables, sat next to the brown and white guests of the bar – reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining patio somewhere to rest.
Arriving Negroes drank beer straight from a third - like in the US series?! - throwing empty bottles around on the beach.
They kept shouting at each other loudly.
In English, it was not.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight out of the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel's swimming pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies -, yelling and yelling in the water, mothers with children and pensioners fled horrifiedly, and within half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
It doesn’t matter if you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff was afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive gold cross about twenty centimeters around his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them chill," replied the waiter.
Drugs don't pass, they don't take.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I knew what they were doing.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it turned out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, such as intellectuals and the lobbying and economically important groups attached to them, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, but also the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent TV footage of the enthusiastic reception of refugees in Germany is at the level of Moscow TV footage from August 1968.
Sure, there were a couple of sunbathers at the station, but mostly - the Old Germans - the Muslims welcomed their privateers.
For long weeks, they were fooling around in the Czech TV news, as according to some research, almost all Germans are for the arrival of emigrants.
Of course, those who have only been in Germany for a few days know that it is a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, the famous public opinion survey organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Law Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our televisions reported.
However, they hid what went wrong the next day in Germany: that in the poll vote for the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - 67,000 people participated in the survey.
It is true that in November 2010, that is, five years ago, Chancellor Merkel publicly declared: “Our quest for a ‘multi-cult’ society has completely failed.”
Then she said, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts for such coexistence have failed completely."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said, the strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live next to each other without integrating themselves has not come to fruition. Today they live here with us and we have been pretending for some time that they will not be left behind one day.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we just live happily next to each other, has failed.
Totally failed.
But neither Merkel has the power to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and above all against political correctness.
This shows an escalation of events.
Conflict is increasing rapidly.
EuroGerman Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, an MP for the SPD, the only one who allegedly doesn't have a degree in the European Parliament - yes, that's what Berlusconi in the EU parliament said he could play the supervisor in the centre from the minute - has performed as he has done several times.
It seems, especially under the impression of the recent statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
It should be noted that, up to some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the citizens of countries that have been victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, and solid Germans?
What years have they tried, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and a killer of millions?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany there is a hundred devils of aggression, supremacy and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his might the attempts of the Great Germans to control the whole of central Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was discontinued, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which brought Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably came back in a different form.
After the attempt by Marxists to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, on the basis of ecology, for example, which was by the way one of the main ideas of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd call it sunny.
The German elites had long resisted the rise of German nationalism, leaving all those anti-atomic fighters, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, silently supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who want to do something differently and better all over the world, they have fully leaned against the planet’s warming fighters, stopped the nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this current there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current which considers all Slavs to be a difficult verb - since the days of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the recent statements of Schulz and the German masters openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which needs to be listened to without a reluctance.
Otherwise, you're sick!
And when we put it together that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it is, as always, capital, especially the German, to which it corresponds, and which comes from the fact that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudowar of solarists first brought the Germans into the basins of ecology and multiculturism, and today it has brought them home and may even bring millions of Muslims.
Which, with the siren’s voice down, will soon hit the wall of a reality that Merkel does not want to see, and will start to stir.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors once again with force, once again a part of its population – but as it seems, an increasingly small part – ideologically popularize it, but in the end, reality will achieve it as always.
Will Germany Burn Again? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Muslim houses are on fire.
What will the German government do when public protests by the Germans against incoming Islamists erupt?
Who will be helped by Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but certainly not assimilated so as to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, who are watching the Islamization of their country, come to their senses?
What will it do to the Germans, and even to Germany, when people rise up, who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superhuman Muslim?
But Germany has just changed.
The conflict, which in Europe provoked the support of a solar ideology, i.e. an elitist and, in principle, totalitarian ideology, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the unflinching conduct towards the disobedient democratic Germans and all the subordinate and disobedient Eastern neighbours, it cannot do well.
Finishing tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of intrusive sellers: scare them to death.
Just tap and the sturdy tap will tap on you in a way that will not necessarily stop weaker in nature.
The living head will cut you down nicely and will start even the dead, on the way away will accompany (or rather will start) an indispensable dealer and a living statue.
Maybe it's a shame that you can't actually get a talking snippet.
It would also be good for us to drive a lot of scoundrels and scoundrels.
Rosemary juice (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates dry environment.
And so it is located between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that, although it belongs to the expansive grasses, looks like it creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's unquestionable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a dry environment, is easily adaptable, modest and uncomplicated.
While it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth watching and taking photos.
Under the petticoat there is still the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazil's Rio Grande Paediatric Society Promotes Healthy Diet in Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey knowledge to women about the importance of good nutrition in breastfeeding using images of breastfeeding children painted by displaying unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and newborn mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected their children’s genetic makeup and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead in Today Show
Thanks to Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s move to Canberry, due to the cost of running out of liberal leadership, they failed to create a sufficient rating increase for Today.
The morning show Nine aired from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage in London as part of a week-long international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The tyranny of the distance to Aussie TV viewers did not seem to matter so much because it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers broadcasting Today.
Today recorded a slight increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only last Thursday (343,000).
Today in recent months fills the gap on the Sunrise.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than just Parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside of New Zealand has an average of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics have been wondering if Thomson himself would be able to hit a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result indicates a clear "yes".
Seven's The X Factor retained a strong 1,136 million viewers, smoothly defeating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded a mixed hit on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30) by Andrew O'Keefe' had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators—sufficient for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers and the second half an incredible 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the drop in The Chase Australia ratings from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia was replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
The Secret Revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is covered in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay state will definitely not reveal who the real one is who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they ungratefully told us who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue behind his teeth until Thursday’s final
All three women lyrically sang why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
In any case, when asked, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler about who will get Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been in an easy relationship ever since.
“From the moment I walked into the house and looked at the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course,” says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are well and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make a great couple with Sam Wood.
She herself claims that during his last home visits, she realized that Wood could be "the real one."
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer just a game – I opened my whole heart to him now,” he added.
I asked who Wood would choose if she didn't eat, and she looked mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls just as much - it's indecisive between Snezena and Lana.
Bachalor broadcasts on Wednesday at 7.30 a.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown a lot of interest after his move to the United States and many teams have asked about his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it seems like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, making a conversion to the Australian rugby league in the first overtime dig at Tuesday's 20:3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of cheering the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-match press conference.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received encouragement from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only take care of the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It certainly wasn’t the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught playing when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his career in the NFL.
“It happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trap to his original debut in 2007, when recording in his own goal area led to the Queensland trio.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding an Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested for targeting guns on the Siberian coast.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his democratic effort was limited.
The <0xC3><0x9A>S became emigrants seeking property refunds.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state to apply for compensation under the Act on Extrajudicial Rehabilitation.
The Court first assigned them the requested amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal amended their claim by granting them only less than CZK 90,000, indicating that the amount of the refund is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The emigrants stood by the Supreme Court and gave them the amount originally sued.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was to pay the money, turned with a complaint to <0xC3><0x9A>S.
In the interim, there was such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the then-valid legislation - albeit adequate in relation to the acquired property - now only reaches the fractional value of the property.
"This cannot go to the difficulty of the secondary participants as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been exercising their rights at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to do so before," Judge Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the party was based on the eS.
"The SBI has repeatedly advocated that the general courts should proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted in favour of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e., the restitution of the state, is always achieved."
Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1> will now make an escape in the musical Studio DVA.
By the way, Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1> became the world's youngest Evita, when in 1998, in her twenties, she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Per<0xC3><0xB3>n in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical Spi<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1>l Lloyd Weber and Time Ricea.
Returning to the same role, he says, "To this day, Evita's demands have not been met by much performance power."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
The role of first lady of Argentina was recommended by Monika Absolonov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I’ve seen Monchu in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
All of a sudden, I saw a whole new concept here.
I am a big fan of more modern designs, but this one is just particularly successful.
"The direction of Ond<0xC5><0x99>eje Sokola is original, relaxed and contemporary," says Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1>.

The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.

In a limited number of performances, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol will also step away from the director’s desk when he will represent the role of President Per<0xC3><0xB3>n during the filming of Karl Roden.
In the interest of the public, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.

Four people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters against a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says that the police used tear gas and then fired it into the air before turning to the rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, according to the report.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which calls for the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators this week in Kathmandu voted on the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic now.
After losing on the ice of the Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov champions, you did not manage a home duel with the hockey players Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry into the extraleague as you did a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

The NHC predicts a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde
A large low-lying system about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde's southernmost islands is 60 percent likely to form a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-cost system, roughly in the middle of the Cape Verdean Islands and the Small Antilles, is also 60 percent likely to form tropical cyclone formations in the next two days, Miami-based weather forecasts added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have flooded European states in fleeing war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Rita Masoudov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Google employee, posted the report on her blog based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
“We travelled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I've been lucky.
But the worsening immigration crisis in Europe is more and more families, like her, willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
According to Google, all contributions made through google.com/refugeerelief will double to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria battered by a four-year war that only drove 4 million people this year.
Many people are also fleeing the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For lightly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether people with mildly obese type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data takes a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an introduction to the new study of JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use various methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the study was conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates a person’s overweight and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastric ectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes mellitus.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who had not been given surgical treatment for diabetes remained approximately the same at a value of 29.
Among the patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, diabetes was solved completely only in 1 percent and in part only in about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers say.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater BMI decreases (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a higher probability of 7% versus 2.9 percent.
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to prolongation of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent more likely to survive in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, it is a soothing result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
“This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group,” he says, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the patient’s BMI dropped between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to show people the gravity of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you have accumulated these genetic changes, which firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really difficult.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not capable of capturing all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He argued that under the present circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, no matter how admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In resolving issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also spoke about the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that “the U.S. violent reaction triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
“I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have consumed sanitation over the last four years
Toxicological centers around the United States reported an almost 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who polished a highly alcoholic sanitizer, according to a toxicological center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia’s Toxicology Center, the number of sanitary intakes in children under 12 who were reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are getting these products more often, and unfortunately, there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking sanitation because of the low-cost habit.
For decades, they allegedly mixed a sanitizer with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the remedy.
“Children don’t think it could hurt them,” Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary remedies) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary products with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several bows can mean alcohol poisoning.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr Stephen Thornton, medical director of the control toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t just let a glass of whiskey simmer, but people leave these sanitizers outside, and when kids get to them, it’s a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four sheets of berries-scented sanitizer at school, was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who cared for her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered incomprehensible words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell down and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my baby.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitary products to be out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitary remedies have been associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a sanitary product that contained a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Physicians believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by deploying antibacterial products around the room, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary remedies and banned their presence in the room.
The police deemed the scheme a "innocent beating" and referred to the discipline of the school district,
F<0xC3><0xA1>ma: No inconsistencies in the Celtic team
Griffiths trivializes the talk of inconsistency in Celtic, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it over again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The penalty in the first half of Adam Rooney's bid ensured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodri, giving the Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths Denies Talking About Incompatibility
This situation sparked controversy at Celtic, which was denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for a match with Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Deficiencies in Scottish title rivalry bore the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers backer and former Netherlands representative Ronald de Boer say Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no more rivalry for the title between them.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, says: "The Netherlands is no longer showing the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
There are no Rangers anymore.
People here don't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old company.
They’re talking about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Company games and it’s not just the people from Scotland who watch these games.
I turn things back to the good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admits that Celtic is a little bit blunt, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things around for good.
Malm's defeat and subsequent relegation from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and is now sticking to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic's been through a bad time and he's gonna rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current situation.
We're all the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic’s support, because it makes the players so much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about large-scale shopping for reinforcements and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the team’s unity at Ibrox.
Former Brentford boss says, “The ice transition window is very different from the summer window.”
Players coming in the summer have the entire pre-season to settle, which you can see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage will occur by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Mich's transitional goal suggests retirement
The attacker Swansea Mich, who was associated with Celtic in the transition window, suggested that after his contract with Swansea expired, he could retire.
The 20-year-old shooter has been struggling with his prone ankle for two years and has not been able to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2–1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3–2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum, who was revoked.
Neilson stands behind his assertion, stating: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
Hardheaded Hibbe was severely criticized after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Sk<0xC3><0xA1>cel.
The incident took place at the Roserburn Inn in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a terrifying moment," the attacker said, continuing, "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in Celtic's shirt."
Tannadic Council believes in Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United still believe in correcting the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the downfall on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
McInnes likes to win "ugly" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold desperately against the Hamilton Accies in order to win their seventh league win in a row and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half in Adam Rooney's bid.
McInnes says: "There is no team that has won anything, whether it's the cups or the leagues, without winning this type of game."
Scottish Unemployment Remains Unchanged While UK Total Unemployment Rises
RESULTS in Scotland remain unchanged at 164,000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 percent higher than in the UK (5.5 percent), according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, and the number of workers now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the course of the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland's Secretary of State David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market, and Scottish employment has grown, while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Was a Witness of Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the man die.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'm gonna sit in a viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison Death Chamber and see Richard Glossip executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who would witness his death.
I first received an invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws nearer, I begin to fear it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to be able to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than free seats, a morbid lottery is conducted that decides who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will be watching the entire execution unattended.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have created a special bond with him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We laugh a lot when we talk together.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to have a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as he apologizes to him, get access.
I complained to her.
She admits that "she could've formulated it better," but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help with anti-death proceedings.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I won't be here to repeat all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's innocent of the murder.
I firmly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is bad.
And it is from this perspective that I will follow his death.
I can't say I'm really being objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love, dying in an unnecessary death.
Man escaped from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after liberating a man from the Canning River.
The man’s bet to run away from the police didn’t come out after he got into the shallow muddy water just meters away from the policeman, who tried to forcefully persuade him to return to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in during an incident crossing into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come for me,' said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and that's the police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when running away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove a car into the pit to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired locals to start planning a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says organizers have tried to spy on him and threaten to end races
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and integrity department of Racing Victoria and based on the belief that they have a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media had always tried to do what was best for the race and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidar's positive cobalt pickup, which he can't explain.
He bit into the tongue about an 18-month espionage charge and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
“I didn’t want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to go up with my head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Moody previously dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity of the department was trying to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out information about the things that are being done in my stables," Moo said.
Of course they thought I was a scammer.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they totally burned me down.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of this today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL let a few balls grow and arrange for people outside the coaching position to take responsibility for what’s going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think they are.
Maybe they need me to take my license and throw me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them material to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will put pressure on them and carry the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels have increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt including Lidari and recent scratching in him has sparked a feeling that he "could be able to clock his license on the table."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on the day of the race "ridiculous" after the horse was applied to the legs with a clay pad or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for covering treatment on the day of the race, to which the organizers have already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don’t know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobra's driver, who was arrested, was arrested.
Police arrested a man who ran into a cyclist over the weekend in Cobra and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by cars on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping and assisting the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalie himself confessed to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop the accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy returns strike to rivals due to wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm coach, criticized his players' actions as "making a plan" by two NRL favorites premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "fight" his players during a controversial victory for Team Storm in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, Brisbane Broncos coach, made a slightly oversized remark at Stromm after his team won the finals over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "show" of rugby league and according to him wrenching two of the Queensland's "non-greatweights".
Bellamy defended the interventions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that the situation has boosted his confidence because his team is criticized by two top coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeating Team Storm.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," he said.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have not changed anything about our defensive system and techniques, in recent weeks we have only focused on contact during the procedures, and that was a turnover for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously is training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like that always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 premiership by playing "difficult" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that is able to play the style of the game, which he finds abysmal, especially his young backups with their speed.
You would like to play such a football if you had this type of player available.
This view was expressed in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football – but not every team has two backers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can’t play that style.
It excites more self-confidence in me because they say things like that because they're afraid of a match against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game for the Broncos team was probably good, I did not look, but what is the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are pauses and non-scoring attempts interesting?
I think they are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday evening at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled from Queensland received a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police seeking 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted during a meeting with the co-accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for possession of commercial quality cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in a cafe entirely accidentally and innocently.
The Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan thought Maximovic would have fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," the court said on Wednesday.
In the corona case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and father-in-law jointly offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
“After reading the sworn statements of both people, it is clear that the $200,000 bail deposited is a real financial burden for them,” Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were apparently insufficient, as the accused did not go further to the court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he renounces both the Australian and Serbian passports, will report daily to the police and will comply with the ban from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg Uses Girl's Phone to Attract Pedophiles to Send Photos
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, then signed up for her online chat, where he had a lot of indecent photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing her phone and then found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing messages.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytic computers found the address and discovered a "worrying" search on the web using phrases to search for unethical images of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that his reason was to "put pedophiles" on the Internet before he "pretending to be a police officer and intimidating them."
Fiscal spokeswoman Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's an addiction - it's dependent on people's fears.
He admitted that he did a search on the computer, but claims he just wanted to pretend to be a policeman to intimidate pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another one.
He said he was doing it to attract them.
He claims he jumped into his drunkenness and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, she trembled and cried.
She saw immoral pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to bringing a lawsuit for taking or providing inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and failed to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the sex offender list because he could argue that there was "no essential sexual understatement" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October for filing reports of social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but he was held in custody before he heard about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sex offenders before the date of his sentence.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe makes a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, earlier this year fell on the stairs leading to the stage.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by opposition lawmakers’ claims that they had received anonymous death threats that warned them of Mr Mugabe’s expulsion during his speech.
He was expelled last month and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, chairman of the MDC, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to prevent Mr Mugabe’s speech.
"The report comes from a number that doesn't appear, but is called 'death'," Mugabe told reporters after his speech.
It warns members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, had "concerns" about threats to MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard has cancelled 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the company’s business services costs.
HP will be split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the business of computers and printers from its fastest-growing hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s CEO and CEO, who will head the unit after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than today’s HP and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores to help businesses transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
The company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produced electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was dubbed the "Silicon Valley Birthplace."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to manage the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in the industry based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is obviously uncertain.
The great harm of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into his former form during the pre-season.
“This type of injury does not threaten a career,” Wenger says.
It is an injury that requires treatment.
This isn't anything special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injury he had suffered before.
This could be purely medically true, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever a player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern here.
The survey, conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd., records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he made his game debut six years ago.
In the last five years, he has played only in 65 league games for Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the magic circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the area of injuries recorded during the final season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition,” Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will and will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to enter.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F-group, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for being the most frightening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 games after last season they kept the campaign "invincible".
The stadium shook on Wednesday night with a 3.2-degree Richter earthquake.
This year it was the 16th in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season’s Champions League when he capitulated against Monaco and there is still a distant hope that he will lead the club to the first European Cup victory.
"This deployment is huge," Wenger says.
The arsenal has never happened.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar appearances in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open themselves more desperately than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under 15 years old.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students reporting symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, it must, of course, be achievable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not the content of the communication, immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though in reality we are rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire and game creator explained recently, money really doesn’t buy more luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was for him the source of this idea.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humour and Chandler's frequent victims, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stems from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they mostly leave their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: "My role as listeners of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will come to my mind when I try to offer a longer-term balancing mechanism.
It emphasizes the small moments in the male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the outsider’s status on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer relationship, from a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to the FredsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends for a glass to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - a total of 236 episodes - for <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG throw Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavani after firing a goal against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG defeat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is a report of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfort victory 2-0 against Malmö at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut and this PSG player sent the French champions after the win, but then threw a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani shot the goal head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not a classic performance for Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted ahead of goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, where he started his famous career in 1999.
"In the Champions League it's not easy to win outside or at home, so a 2-0 win makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things we'll have to improve with the course of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
"We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after being injured as one of three changes to PSG, who made a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at home this weekend, but was shadowed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who would move PSG in Europe to a new level after the move from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he raced to the pass of Marc Verratti for the defense of Malma and with a beautiful finish sent the ball behind the back of Johan Wilanda to the far-flung Roanky.
However, if someone expected it to launch a grandiose PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off and reached this stage, joined with 9 internationals in the base squad and five defenders and two covered backers were heavy opponents.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjica's shot, which just crossed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves were looking for a benefit from the attack with poor scores and a miserable finish, which was not good either from Ibrahimovic, who failed to fire even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates, and it was precisely from his innings that Di Maria sent a rotating shot that ended up in Wilando's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayec with the header sent behind the line already sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic added to him after a left win from Maxwell.
This put an end to all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they might get something out of the match, and only Wilanda's excellent intervention from close proximity obscured David Luiz's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even at the moment when the goal of the alternating Ezela was not changed.
Malmo team coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hat down for Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore Makes $2.5 Billion to Sell Shares
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by a collapse in commodity prices, made $2.5 billion in stock sales on Wednesday as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing commodity price undermining as China’s slowing economy slows down demand and sparks market-wide destruction.
The rights issue sent the price of Glencore stocks to the top of the London stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion in shares is part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated about a third.
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They thus disposed of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about prolonging the slowdown in Chinese growth have halved the price of iron ore and coal, copper and other commodities have collapsed by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Says Washington Has Visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing, which the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his cousin Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen U.S.-China relations and encourages cooperation in resolving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the differences between the two states,” the statement said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at a U.N. meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis unraveled the Schengen area.
The emergency lights fired by Germany have far removed the European crew, but are already forcing the ship to change course, the French newspaper Le Figaro writes.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal first with the refugee problem: it will systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it enters the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than in order to argue more realistically over the future distribution of refugees.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before we take care of the final destination of the refugees, we first need to filter out those who arrive today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the minister said in a text discussed Monday in Brussels.
After the single currency crisis, the EU finds itself in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases the pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in that country.
The central power thus makes it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday has already served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen acquis.
It's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new at all, but it is being implemented rigidly.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived runners have already been registered and identified with the removal of their fingerprints.
Budapest refuses to establish any entry point in its territory, because it fears more than others that there will be no camps on its shores in which refugees will accumulate at its expense.
Greece remains the true black hole in the world.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as many as it has recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge slingshot hole.
Athens, which are still in financial turmoil and are waiting for a new government, have put their hands in the gutter.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of shared concerns now for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The Juncker Commission promises that checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The calls Greece is facing apply to the whole of Europe," EU Interior Ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on the front.
It is therefore a question of deploying the European Border Control Agency Frontex’s intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its asylum-seeking capacity and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," the text, submitted to ministers for approval, warns.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting closer.
The new emergency situation of the eighty-eighth has also moved the issue of binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees, already raised at the beginning of the year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by an eighty-eighth majority.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise is the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been agreed during the EU's hectic summit in June, Le Figaro said.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, of which three are Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by the avalanche in the French Alps.
German nationality is also a woman, according to the authorities, who survived as the only one of the affected eight-member group.
Previous media reports said it was about Polk.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a severe leg injury.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly 40-year-olds.
"The rescue operation is over, and the bodies of the victims have also been transferred to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain range below the summit of the mountain D<0xC3><0xB4>me de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The large avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow had accumulated on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The Meteorological Service did not warn the area of bad weather today.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match with Braga: Finally the real Europe.
Coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, during his cup premiere, managed to cross the pre-league of the European League with the Liberec players into the base group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan at the start of the main stage of the competition will welcome the finalist from 2011 Braga and according to the coach wants to impose her style of play.
After all the nerves in the knockout fights, when every goal and every situation could throw you on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every incremented goal, we can play our tactics and we’re not bound by a mere doubles.
"I look forward to it and it's a real Europe, before that it was just a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said at a press conference.
He considers Braga to be the top team.
He will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult because he doesn’t have that name, but he has a player in his squad who I guess gave Manchester three goals.
"It's an excellent whole at the level of the top teams," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But he doesn't consider Braga to be a clear favorite.
I take it by playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong in our stadium, both in the home competition and in the forecourts, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost out of the eleven duels of this season only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can impose his style on Braze as well.
We are waiting for a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is atypically disciplined for them.
They play from 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will perform on the pitch," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
In the foreground we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted training.
"And we definitely want it, even though it will be very challenging to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films are dominated by Sand, an international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have registered their works for the 15th edition of the International Student Film Festival in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Four dozen of them, sent to the final by a committee of students and educators, will be screened in the cinema Porty<0xC4><0x8D> from 15 to 18 October.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which takes place from the festival bell.
This year, she's a detective.
The director of this year’s festive evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre productions.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our coup this year," Charv<0xC3><0xA1>t said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury including last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival, as every year, prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbosanson band Summer?, playing the band Grain or for example Petra Hapkov<0xC3><0xA1> with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first brings a graduate of the Sand Film School and a holder of prestigious awards, among which there is also a World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition draws closer to the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin <0xC4><0x8C>ech will meet the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and the songwriters Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> will baptize his new book P. 3 friends from the city.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ka, the patron of FAMO in P<0xC3><0xAD>sko, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his link, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other, and develop joint ties and filmmaking," the spokesperson said.
A Pitching forum will certainly help to do this, where students can meet with film professionals, complete several job competitions at once and gain a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher Professional Film School in P<0xC3><0xAD>sko.
Its founders, the husbands of Vladana and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>ovi, organized the first edition in 1997.
It took place once every two years until the age of six.
In the event of CK’s bankruptcy, insurance companies have to pay the client’s claims in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of a travel agency in full.
This was decided by the House on Wednesday when it approved a revised draft of the law on business conditions in the tourism industry.
Travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with bank guarantees according to the bill, which is aimed at assessing to the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development is in the process of adapting, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the travel agency's bankruptcy insurance when the novella pays off.
However, the proposal is also criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go to a foreign country.
Karla <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full refunds are not euro-comforming.
She drew attention to this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the correct limit, <0xC5><0xA0>lechtov<0xC3><0xA1> stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit in order to be feasible," said the vice president of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one gives it unlimited.
"The roadside offices will have to terminate their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
A member of the presidency of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousk's concerns on the basis of a survey among members of the CK.
"Stop showing us lobbying the insurers," he said.
The statement of the insurers does not consider Okamura to be relevant, and there is no official written statement of them in this sense.
However, they say they find out if the travel agencies will participate together, which according to Okamura is not a problem.
Before the provisions, Jana Fischerov<0xC3><0xA1> (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Competitive Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel Agencies, also warned.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” says Fischer.
Her proposal to release the contested passage was not approved by the House.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) did not go away with the proposal to return the proposal to the committee because of the alleged conflict with the civil code.
Filip pointed out to travel agencies, which he said could be endangered by consumers.
Martina Berdychov<0xC3><0xA1> (ANO) has withdrawn her proposal to limit the liability of insurers in cases where they could not know that insurance coverage does not cover all the risk.
The novel will not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of 4 million for travel agencies offering air travel and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus trips.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of planned sales from the sale of tours.
However, the limit of insurance coverage will have to be such that in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency, it will cover all the claims of the customers.
The norm even after the amendments stipulates that the travel agencies will have to state, in the case of sold trips, which travel agency organizes the trip.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before the conclusion of the contract, among other things, data on the management and the number of trips.
The approved amendment proposal of the Committee on Public Administration also counts on further regular information to the insurance companies.
Travel agencies will need to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and trips sold, the total price of trips sold, and the amount of advances and sales for trips and for tips on them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will call upon it according to the draft to correct or will be able to prohibit it from concluding new contracts in case the breach of the obligation could jeopardize the interest
The novella is also to adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of subsidy for the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The application will contain a report on the use of state funds in the past year, the financial plan of expenditure and the outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the proponent of the law, however, did not think of the situation, what will happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and clients who bought the tour before the cancellation of the insurance, so according to the association will lose it.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even fail, even though its management was in good condition.
One of the options that travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be a claim on the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then in our market we will act only as agencies, said the vice president of the association Jan Pape<0xC5><0xBE>.
According to him, the draft novel also contains an institute of bank guarantee, but so unthinkable that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in existing practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the entire law will need to be recast due to the new EU directive.
The Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
This year, only three CKs have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell trips worth about CZK 20 billion annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must strive to improve the humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German country prime ministers.
At the same time, it again called for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the member states of the eighty.
We need to help more countries where refugees are leaving, or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will be advocating decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal could also be higher financial aid or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"Countries also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the refugee crisis's weight to European countries," Merkel said.
The Prime Minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expects true solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out for accelerating asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay.
This is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees is used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will be needed to get the refugees to master the German language.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if runners succeed in integrating, they can be of benefit to us, he said.
Matt Damon: Diversity in Film
Matt Damon confronted Afroamethic filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, arguing that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the Greenlight HBO project, the actor cast in Brown's series interrupted by emphasizing the need for alternative views on the black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it by filming and not acting,” Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted distrustfully, and exclaimed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Mart<0xC3><0xA5>n got aired.
Damon and Brown teamed up with well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at the start.
The only black character that is a whore packed by a white pasa.
The producer of the Dear White People advocated the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their director "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of a single black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet has gained more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 characters since it was released.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the murder of teen Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national effect and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made an appearance on the movement, while citing the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The latest leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, made a statement in an answer to Fox News’ question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the executive said.
Damon was recently listed on the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or met with the pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has its first winner"
Professional climber and duckling Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and brought home a million dollars.
In the competition, which has just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants have managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men fought in the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second sprint after more than 220 m of rope.
Britten was the first to complete the ploy within the set limit, becoming the first competitor in the American Ninja Warrior to outperform the intensifying 4th lap, but Caldiero outperformed it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for the E! News news report just after his hard-won win and it was known that he was still in shock from winning the top prize worth $1 million.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won no award despite being the first competitor to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who finishes the route the fastest.
"If more competitors take part in the race, the race will be won at the best time," Weed said.
Although the win of the main win would have changed his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he'd be jealous.
I'm glad he managed to do what he could.
He received a warm welcome from his fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
For his children and his wife, he is a hero."
Geoff told me, "If there was someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue for the eighth season, which will begin shooting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers Passed Just Around the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't just a walk in the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers only narrowly reversed their defeat when they defeated the Minnesota in Tuesday's match with a close score of 5-4 at Target Field.
The twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the words to Z, which was so unbeatable for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun, and it doesn’t matter how,” Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger striker Alfredo Simon retained his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two laps and then took another in the sixth and ninth laps.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponents 6 1/3 shots and 3 rounds.
It was his third successful game in the last nine games.
“This year I want to end with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you sit on a bench often and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tiger tycoon Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 laps and his first point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last game in June, in which he hit four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He's got a good grip on it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good on training, he fired significantly better and managed to transfer it to the match."
With three rounds at the end of the seventh round, the Twins had the greatest chance of returning to the game.
Byron Buxton, a midfielder, scored two points on the left side of the field.
Right-handed poleman Aaron Hicks scored a point with a set thumb and Simon pushed Brian Dozier out before he was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy eliminated his only opponent, Mauer, and was ahead of the batsman Miguel San, who fired the ball and ran two yards and left right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the goals and a chance at a draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third metre over two metres.
Plouffe has already won 27 laps over two yards this season and reigns in the league table.
Detroit retained the ninth round, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon scored 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander eliminated Sana for three overtimes.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers won three rounds in the first two rounds against a well-served right-hander who entered the game after more than a month of pause due to back muscle inflammation.
"I hadn't imagined such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift I already felt like I was getting better."
After resisting the attack in the first shift, Hughes left one point to the second yardstick Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for J.D. Martinez's right-hand poleman Victor Martinez, who was the first to pass all goals.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Third-metaler Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored the next round, but Victor Martinez was missed when he tried to score on the third goal.
The Tigers added in the second round, when James McCann and Anthony Gose scored two and one points and the resulting score was 3-0.
"That got us to our knees," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of overs, finished in the third round with no points and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three goals, six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers’ right-hander, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured due to strained shoulder muscles since mid-August, is scheduled to enter the Wednesday match.
Sanchez replaces leftist Daniel Norris, who returns after being injured and takes on the Twins.
As of June 30, when Norris was traded for left-back David Price, he has a score of 1-1 after 4 games.
However, since August 20, he has not played since due to a strained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third reciprocal game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left-back Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday’s management reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said about the 16th meeting of the Central Group on Deepening the Comprehensive Reform.
Propagation of opening up at the birth of reforms will add new momentum and vitality, also provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Group of Leaders adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved by means of test programs.
This step is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and make sure that the companies themselves will decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow the border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad, and will provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to optimisation of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and chief executives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, a new bedding division may be created.
According to Deputy Head of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Panik (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
There are also opportunities to extend care in the region.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, one-day surgery centers could be established, where according to the established concept, performances of surgical fields that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours would be performed.
In which specific hospitals the workplace focused on one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases could be created.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center, which would take care of patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the hospital Ostrov, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, is the bed of follow-up care, especially the bed Long-term treatment of the sick (LDN), the capacity of which in Njedk is insufficient and, above all, the bed should be kept close to the bedding.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the bed of follow-up care is missing mainly in the hospital of Karlovy Vary.
There, abandoned buildings could be used after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the republic, so it could also serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer’s Center.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called ‘suspension beds’, for which European grant funds will be made available.
"These are beds that will follow up on the fields of suppespecialized care and will create a space for translation of patients after the procedure, for example, after cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other procedure," describes the regional concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
